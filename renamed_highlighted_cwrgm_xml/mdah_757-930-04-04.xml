                    <p xml:id='OTPS63572P0'>James Phelan served in the Confederate Senate from Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63572P1'>Born on October 11, 1821, in Huntsville, Alabama, Phelan gained experience in newspaper editing during his teenage years, working for the <hi rend='italic'>Democrat</hi> and the <hi rend='italic'>Flag of the Union</hi>. In 1843, he was appointed the Alabama state printer. Soon after he turned his attention to legal practice and became an attorney in 1846. Phelan moved to Aberdeen, Mississippi, in 1849 and started a successful law firm.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63572P2'>In 1860, Phelan won a seat in the Mississippi State Senate and served in that role until he was elected as one of Mississippi’s first senators to the First Confederate Congress. He served from 1862 to 1864. His most notable act as a Confederate senator was the introduction of legislation authorizing the government to confiscate cotton from southern citizens, with Confederate bonds given in exchange, for foreign loans. The bill generated a great deal of anger across the south and was defeated in the Senate. Phelan lost reelection in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63572P3'>After the Civil War, Phelan moved to Memphis, Tennessee and practiced law. He died on May 17, 1873, at the age of 52. Phelan was married to Elizabeth Jones Moore and had five children. He is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009375P0'>John Anthony Winston was a politician and governor of Alabama during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009375P1'>Born on September 4, 1812, in Alabama Territory, Winston was privately educated and attended LaGrange College (modern-day University of North Alabama) and Cumberland College (modern-day University of Nashville) in Tennessee. As a young man, Winston saw success as a planter and a cotton commissioner. He later entered politics, winning election to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1840 and 1842, before winning a seat in the Alabama Senate in 1843. He served in the state senate until 1853, when he won election as governor of Alabama. He served for four years, and gained a reputation for vetoing legislation, including bills that directed government funds for transportation projects, such as railroads. Winston did support public education, and signed legislation to create a state school system in 1854.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009375P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Winston volunteered for Confederate military service. He had slight military experience from his efforts to raise and lead a militia company in 1846, during the Mexican-American War. The unit was never activated for service in Mexico and it remained in Alabama. His wish to lead troops into combat was granted during the Civil War, as he received a commission as colonel of the Eighth Alabama Infantry Regiment and led the unit during campaigns in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009375P3'>After the Civil War, Winston tried to reenter politics. He served as a delegate to Alabama’s 1865 constitutional convention, and won election to the U.S. Senate in 1866. However, his seat was denied due to his refusal to take an oath of allegiance to the United States. He died on December 21, 1871. He was married to his cousin, Mary Jones, and had one child. Winston is buried in the Winston Family Cemetery in Gainesville, Alabama.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63137P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines the Irish nationality as "belonging to or relating to Ireland, its people, or its language." (Cambridge Dictionary) While Irish people immigrated to the United States throughout the colonial period, their numbers skyrocketed in the nineteenth century.  Before the 1830s, most Irish immigrants were Protestant Christians from Northern Ireland, but during the 1830s and 1840s Catholics from southern Ireland composed the overwhelming majority of Irish immigrants to the U. S. Cheaper, easier transportation, economic strain, overpopulation, and finally the Irish Potato Famine of the mid-1840s made life difficult for impoverished farmers in Ireland, pushing many to seek a new life and new fortunes in the U. S. Many Irish immigrants remained impoverished upon relocating, as few possessed trade skills or more than elementary educations. Many Irish immigrants formed ethnic communities primarily in large urban centers like New York and New Orleans to preserve Irish language, religion, and culture and to offer reciprocal communal assistance. Irish Americans maintained a complicated relationship to Americans of color in the nineteenth century. While many Irish Americans often lived and interacted in close proximity to African Americans and Chinese Americans, competition for living and working spaces often pitted them against each other. Many Irish Americans therefore adopted American racism as a means of advancement, arguing that, though non-native born and in certain cases Catholic, they at least had white skin. This stance appears most clearly in the New York Draft Riot of 1863, in which mostly Irish American mobs attacked African American people, their businesses, and homes in response to the Emancipation Proclamation in tandem with the Union Army's draft. Regardless, many Irish American communities, particularly Catholics, in the nineteenth century faced extreme nativism, or the fear of and discrimination against those not born in the U. S. Irish Americans nonetheless served in great numbers during the American Civil War and won acclaim for their actions. Irish Americans also composed a disproportionate percentage of American Catholics and were incredibly influential in the development of the Catholic Church in the U. S. Ultimately, Irish Americans, while often maintaining a strong sense of Irish nationalism, wielded an enormous influence on American culture, religion, and politics throughout the nineteenth century and beyond (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 68-73).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

My Dear Sir:—
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1413366P1' xml:id='OTP1413366P1'>I reached here on yesterday. I enquired this morning at Gov <rs ref='#S25009375'>Win=ston</rs>'s and the [P.O.?] but have rec<add place='above'>d</add> no communication from yourself. As you have, probably, written me ere This, I fear it may have miscarried. I, at least, deem it necessary to inform you of the fact.
