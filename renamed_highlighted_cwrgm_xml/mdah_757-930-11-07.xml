                    <p xml:id='OTPS63316P0'>Beriah Magoffin was an attorney and politician who served as governor of Kentucky during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P1'>Born on April 18, 1815, in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, Magoffin graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, in 1835 before receiving a law degree from Transylvania University in 1838. He moved to Mississippi immediately afterwards and soon became the reading clerk for the Mississippi Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P2'>In 1839, Magoffin returned to Kentucky, reportedly due to an illness. He opened a law firm in Harrodsburg and the next year received an appointment as police judge. By the mid-1840s he was active in Democratic Party politics. He served as an elector in four consecutive presidential elections (1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856), and was elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1848, 1856, and 1860. He served a single term in the Kentucky Senate in 1850 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives and lieutenant governor of Kentucky in the 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P3'>Despite his political defeats, Magoffin won Kentucky’s 1859 gubernatorial election. He championed the institution of slavery and joined other southern politicians in defending states’ rights over federal authority, including the right of secession. However, during the secession crisis that erupted after Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Magoffin advocated moderation to southern secessionists. He offered a compromise plan which, among other ideas, recommended that the northern states repeal all laws that hindered the Fugitive Slave Act and that protected slavery in the southern half of the western territories (both major elements of previous compromises, including the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Compromise of 1850). Magoffin’s proposal was rejected by other southern governors and failed to stem the drive toward secession.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P4'>In January 1861, Magoffin called Kentucky’s legislature into session to organize a convention over the state’s future in the Union. The largely pro-Union legislature rejected his call. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Magoffin condemned Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the secessionists. However, the governor also respected his fellow Kentuckians’ opposition to secession, and rejected overtures by the Confederate government. In May 1861, Kentucky’s legislature passed a resolution declaring the state officially neutral. Magoffin honored the decision and sent letters to both President Lincoln and the Confederate president Jefferson Davis, requesting the two opposing sides of the Civil War recognize Kentucky as a neutral entity.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P5'>As the war progressed, Kentucky’s Unionists won additional state elections. Magoffin, still influenced by mild Confederate sympathies, vetoed several congressional bills, but the majority pro-Union legislature overrode many of them. Late in 1861, Confederate and Union armies marched into Kentucky. Magoffin attempted to condemn both sides, but the state legislature passed a bill denouncing only the Confederate incursion. Magoffin vetoed the bill, which was promptly overridden.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P6'>Facing constant opposition in office, Magoffin offered to resign from the governor’s office in the summer of 1862 if he could pick his replacement (as the lieutenant governor’s position had been vacant since 1859). Kentucky Unionists agreed. He selected James F. Robinson, who was in turn elected speaker of the house by the Unionists and placed in the line of succession. True to his word, Magoffin then resigned on August 18, 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P7'>Magoffin returned to practicing law. After the Civil War he proved very successful in real estate in Chicago, Illinois. He returned to political office in the late 1860s, serving in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1867 to 1869. He argued in favor of the Thirteenth Amendment and for the protection of African American civil rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P8'>Magoffin died on February 28, 1855. He was married to Anna Shelby and had at least ten children. He is buried in Spring Hill Cemetery in Harrodsburg, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63562P0'>John Cabell Breckinridge was an attorney, politician, and vice president of the United States, who became a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P1'>Born on January 16, 1821, in Lexington, Kentucky, Breckinridge was part of a family of notable politicians, including his father who served as Kentucky’s secretary of state, a grandfather who had been a U.S. senator, and a great grandfather who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Breckinridge was well educated in his youth and eventually graduated with a law degree from Transylvania University. He began a successful law practice in Kentucky and became active in local public and political affairs. When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Breckinridge sought a military commission. He eventually was made a major in the Third Kentucky Infantry Regiment and traveled with the unit to Mexico. However, by the time the regiment arrived at the front, most of the fighting was finished, and Breckinridge saw no combat. Nevertheless, his military service proved a benefit for his burgeoning political career.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P2'>Breckinridge won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1849. He proved to be a strong defender of slaveholding interests in a state that bordered many free northern states. In 1851, he entered the U.S. House of Representatives from Kentucky, and became a close associate with notable statesman Henry Clay of Kentucky. He won election for a second term and played a prominent role in the passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act in 1854, which overturned the Missouri Compromise's prohibition of slavery in certain federal territories. He declined to run for a third term, due to political redistricting that made his reelection unlikely. However, in 1856, he was nominated as James Buchanan’s vice presidential candidate on the Democratic presidential ticket. Buchanan and Breckinridge won the 1856 election, and Breckinridge served as the U.S. vice president from 1857 to 1859, when he was elected to fill a vacant Kentucky seat in the U.S. Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P3'>During the 1860 presidential election, southern Democrats split from the national Democratic Party, largely due to disagreements over the defense of slavery. The national party nominated northerner Stephen A. Douglas while the southern Democrats held a separate convention and nominated Breckinridge. This split helped doom overall Democratic Party success at the 1860 polls, resulting in the election of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate, to the presidency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P4'>During the secession crisis that followed Lincoln’s election, Breckinridge served in the U.S. Senate. His southern sympathies were well known, but Kentucky did not formally secede. In October 1861, when it was clear that his state would remain in the Union, Breckinridge resigned his seat and joined the Confederacy. He was widely criticized by many in Kentucky as a traitor to the United States. Soon afterwards, he accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate army, and was subsequently promoted to major general. Breckinridge led Confederate troops at several battles in the eastern and western theaters, including Shiloh, Vicksburg, Baton Rouge, Murfreesboro, and Monocacy. In February 1865, near the end of the war, he was appointed Secretary of War of the Confederacy. By then the Confederate government was nearly in shambles and the war ended before he played much of an administrative role.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P5'>Breckinridge initially fled to the Caribbean, then Great Britain, and then Canada rather than surrender to Union forces. He met his family in Canada and then moved to France and Switzerland, rather than risk arrest by returning to the United States. He finally moved back to Kentucky after President Andrew Johnson issued a full amnesty for former Confederates in December 1868.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P6'>Breckinridge refrained from reentering politics, despite requests from his supporters. He engaged in railroad business and participated in public events only as a private citizen. He died from complications of a lung surgery on May 17, 1875. He was married to Mary Burch and had at least seven children. He is buried in the Lexington Cemetery in Lexington, Kentucky.

When the State of Kentucky was created on June 1, 1792, Mercer County was merged for a final time into the state of Kentucky and incorporated on March 1, 1836.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99663P0'>The term "emancipation" describes "the act of freeing a person from another person's control" (Cambridge Dictionary). In the nineteenth-century United States, this term most often referred to an enslaved person's escape from their enslaver's control and legal ownership. Self-emancipation describes "the act of an enslaved person freeing him or herself from the bondage of slavery," by a variety of means legal and extralegal. (American Battlefield Trust)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P1'>Occurring throughout the nineteenth century, self-emancipation under the law took the form of an enslaved person purchasing their own freedom through wages made performing trades outside of their enslaver's property. This process most often occurred in urban areas, particularly those in coastal regions of the U.S., but state legal restrictions made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P2'>The most extreme and least common form of self-emancipation was suicide, which many enslaved people chose rather than remaining in bondage. The most frequent method of self-emancipation, especially during the American Civil War, was to escape from an enslaver's property and flee without their permission. Many notable abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman self-emancipated by running away. Running away signaled how self-emancipation caused legal emancipation for all the enslaved in the United States. During the Civil War, so many enslaved persons self-emancipated and fled to Union lines that the U.S. government had to craft a response. That response manifested first in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later in the 13th Amendment of 1865, which abolished slavery altogether. Self-emancipation became a primary way for enslaved African Americans in the antebellum U.S. to wield agency over their lives, and their efforts eventually succeeded in producing legislative emancipation from the top down.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
