                    <p xml:id='OTPS68611P0'>William Littleton Harris was a legal expert and judge in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P1'>Born on July 6, 1807, in Elbert County, Georgia, Harris proved an exceptionally fast learner and graduated from the University of Georgia at the age of fifteen. He studied law and applied to be admitted as a practicing attorney as a minor. The state legislature had to pass a law to authorize him admission to the bar due to his youthful age.  In 1837, Harris moved to Mississippi and began a very successful law office. He became a circuit judge in 1853 and helped author the Mississippi Code of 1857. In 1858, Harris received an appointment to the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeal (currently the state’s supreme court) and proved to be a fiercely strong supporter of slavery and white supremacy. In 1859, he wrote the court’s opinion in <hi rend='italic'>Mitchell v. Wells</hi>, which rejected a former slave’s right to inherit property from her white father. The court’s decision concluded that African Americans were not citizens, as citizenship was reserved for white people.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P2'>In 1860, Harris received an offer to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court by President James Buchanan. He turned down the appointment due to growing political tension over slavery and his expectation that the south would secede from the Union. Instead, Harris accepted an appointment from Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, to serve as a secession commissioner to Georgia. He spoke before the Georgia General Assembly, calling for the south's separation from the Union in order to prevent northerners from ending slavery in the south and extending civil rights to African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P3'>During the Civil War, Harris served as a circuit court judge in Mississippi. Following the war, he received an appointment to serve again on the state’s High Court of Errors and Appeals, but was blocked by President Andrew Johnson. Harris left Mississippi in 1867 and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he began a law practice with two other attorneys. He passed away on November 27, 1868, from complications of pneumonia. Harris was married to Frances Semmes and had six children. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD68643P0'>Military elections were a common practice within volunteer and militia units of both the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War, a tradition with its roots going back to the Revolutionary War. These elections took place at the company and regimental levels. Company officers were elected by the unit’s soldiers, and in turn, these company officers elected the regiment’s Colonel, Lt. Colonel, and Majors. Officially, Governors had the authority to appoint a Colonel to command a regiment but usually deferred to the officer elected by the regiment's men. Often, these elections put men without military experience or otherwise unqualified to lead their units into battle with disastrous outcomes. Also, junior officers found it difficult to enforce military discipline as they were beholden to the soldiers for their position, which they could be voted out of.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD68643P1'>Union and Confederate authorities sought to limit the detrimental effects of these officer elections. On July 22, 1861, the day after the Union loss at the First Battle of Bull Run, the United States Congress authorized an examination board for officers. Many were deemed unfit and removed, while others resigned. The Confederate Congress established a similar board on October 13, 1862. Military elections continued during the war but to a lesser extent due to government oversight on both sides. They eventually ended in favor of ensuring qualified officers were put in command positions. (James M. McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</hi>; <hi rend='italic'>Public Laws of the Confederate States of America</hi>, 1862 Public Laws, S2, 85-87; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
