                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005041P0'>Military schools are educational programs that incorporate military studies with traditional academic topics. They often emphasize engineering and technical studies. The school lifestyle and environment typically model the military; students are considered cadets, wear uniforms and conduct formation drills, and follow a military-style chain of command. These schools were largely a nineteenth century development in the United States, following the creation of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, during Thomas Jefferson’s presidential administration. While that academy, and the United States Naval Academy, founded in 1845, were federal institutions, most military schools were private or state-funded programs. Military service was not required for the graduates of state or private military programs, but alumni from such schools often sought commissions in the military. Additionally, during the Civil War, the Union and the Confederate armies relied heavily upon graduates of state and federal military academies to train and lead the large numbers of civilian soldiers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD100571P0'>Founded in 1839 in Lexington, Virginia, the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) was the first state military college in the United States. The school was modeled after the United States Military Academy at West Point and the École Polytechnique school in Paris, France, leading to a more military and engineering program rather than liberal arts. Faculty members tended to be former military officers, including some from Europe. West Point graduate Thomas J. Jackson served as an instructor before becoming a general in the Confederate Army and achieving fame and the nickname “Stonewall” Jackson. Cadets at VMI occasionally participated in active military duties before and during the Civil War, including serving as a military guard during the execution of John Brown following his raid against Harper’s Ferry in 1859. Cadets at VMI also saw combat during the war, being called to action from campus fourteen different times by Confederate authorities.  Dozens of VMI alumni saw service during the Civil War. Fifteen graduates rose to the rank of general within the Confederate Army and one achieve the rank of general in the Union Army. The school remains open today, still serving as a state military college. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD90650P0'>The Harper’s Ferry Armory was a United States armory and arsenal constructed between 1799 and 1802 in Harper’s Ferry, Virginia (now part of West Virginia). Built as the second federal armory in the United States (the first being Springfield Armory in Massachusetts), the Harper’s Ferry Armory originally consisted of a single room with twenty-five employees producing muskets for the U.S. military. In 1845, U.S. officials expanded the armory to seven workshops and by 1859 the facility employed four hundred workers. The armory produced tens of thousands of muskets, rifles, and pistols during manufacturing operations between 1802 and 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD90650P1'>The Harper’s Ferry Armory gained fame in part due to a raid by militant abolitionist John Brown in 1859. Brown hoped to spark a slave revolt in Virginia and Maryland, and arm the fugitive slaves with weapons from the arsenal. He and a small band of supporters easily captured the brick fire engine house of the armory, but were soon surrounded and then defeated by U.S. Marines under the command of Colonel Robert E. Lee. Brown was captured alive and tried in court for the raid.  While his raid on Harper’s Ferry failed to start a slave rebellion, Brown used the publicity of his court case to publicly denounce slavery. When he was given the death penalty for the raid, many anti-slavery advocates celebrated Brown as a martyr for abolition. Brown’s actions linked Harper’s Ferry to the slavery debate and the sectional conflict of North versus South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD90650P2'>During the Civil War, the Harper’s Ferry Armory changed hands between Union and Confederate military forces at least eleven times. It sustained severe damage during those events, and when the war ended the U.S. War Department chose not to rebuild the facilities. Only the brick fire engine house used by John Brown’s raiders survived the wartime destruction and disrepair. (Wikipedia)<lb/>

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD78266P0'>Shortly after declaring the state of Mississippi separated from the United States in January 1861, its secession convention passed an order entitled “An Ordinance to Regulate the Military System of the State of Mississippi.” This ordinance created a Military Board to oversee Mississippi’s military personnel and resources. This board was to be made up of four brigadier generals and a major general in charge of the state’s militia, and the governor. On January 23, the convention elected the board members as Jefferson Davis (as major general) and Earl Van Dorn, Charles Clark, James L. Alcorn, and Christopher H. Mott (as brigadier generals). Shortly thereafter, the Military Board met to build and prepare Mississippi’s armed forces. It appointed Richard Griffith to the position of adjutant general, Samuel G. French to oversee the ordnance requirements, and William Barksdale for the quartermaster general. With appointments complete, the board then published instructions for Mississippi’s military structure, procedures, tactics, and equipment in the form of <hi rend='italic'>Orders of the Military Board of the State of Mississippi</hi>. Over the next several weeks, the board handled a wide variety of strategic and administrative tasks, such as planning the defense of Mississippi’s coastline and facilitating the purchase of rations and weapons for Mississippi troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD78266P1'>Although the Military Board began well, it soon ran into problems. Many of its members vacated their positions for promotions into Confederate service. Davis was elected president of the Confederacy, and the brigadier generals took military positions within the Confederate army. Mississippi officials appointed new generals to take their place on the Military Board, but the governor’s dislike of Alcorn caused controversy and led to another individual—Reuben Davis—being promoted to major general. Additional problems arose when most of Mississippi ‘s troops and equipment were transferred into Confederate service. Continued enlistments into that army prevented the state’s militia force from maintaining a steady number or presence. The Military Board spent much of its time during the summer of 1861 trying to procure sufficient weapons and soldiers for state service. By the fall, Mississippi officials believed that the Military Board was an inefficient method of governing the militia. The board was discontinued in November 1861. (Timothy B. Smith, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi in the Civil War</hi>, 52–60)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63189P0'>Formally established in 1812, the Ordnance Department within the U.S. Army oversaw the procurement, maintenance, and development of weapons and ammunition. Ordnance personnel manned federal armories and powder magazines. To facilitate the department’s responsibilities across the many army posts and fortifications, in 1832 the U.S. Congress created the rank of Ordnance Sergeant. The rank was given only to experienced soldiers, after a battery of tests, proving their aptitude in maintaining and distributing arms and ammunition to field units. The Ordnance Department was rather small, but increased in size during military conflicts. During the Mexican-American War, the organization grew to roughly the size of an infantry regiment, with a colonel in command, more than two dozen commissioned officers, and several hundred enlisted soldiers. Additionally, the branch employed hundreds of civilians at it arsenals and armories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63189P1'>The Civil War saw a massive expansion of the Ordnance Department. To procure enough arms and ammunition to outfit an army that consisted of two million soldiers over the course of four years, the department itself grew nearly ten times in size, from roughly one thousand to nine thousand personnel. Most were civilian employees, as the military staff consisted of less than seventy officers and around six hundred enlisted soldiers. Between 1861 and 1865, the Ordnance Department procured and supplied the Union Army with 45,000 tons of lead for musket balls, 6,500 tons of cannon balls and artillery shells, and 13,000 tons of gun powder. Beyond these formal supply duties, the Ordnance Department provided training and equipment to soldiers within field units to carry out low level maintenance on firearms, cannons, and other ordnance supplies in the field.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32159149P0'>During the American Revolution, the Continental Army created the Adjutant General and the Inspector General as two different positions within the military. The Adjutant General was the administrative and personnel support element of the military, while the Inspector General was responsible for assessing and investigating internal military matters. After American independence and the reduction of the military, the Adjutant General’s Office took over most Inspector General duties. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Union and Confederate officials had to restructure the Adjutant General and Inspector General duties to support the massive expansion of military forces. State militaries, like in Virginia, also grew rapidly in response to the war, requiring robust administrative and inspection capabilities. Mississippi placed all of those responsibilities onto the Adjutant and Inspector General Office. The Adjutant and Inspector General, as well as his assistants, helped facilitate the recruitment, enlistment, and organization of new troops in Virginia, as well as oversaw rules and regulations and supply issues.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63188P0'>The Republican Party is a national political party in the United States. It was formed in 1854 in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved previous restrictions to slavery in the western territories of the United States. Anti-slavery members of the Whig and Democratic political parties broke from these groups and joined with members of the singularly focused Free Soil Party to develop a major third party challenger for national politics. The Republican Party strongly opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories but did not advocate for the immediate abolition of slavery in the country. The party was more successful than the preceding Free Soil party because it developed a broader political platform than the territorial issue, adopting Whig-inspired economic principles. The growing success of the Republicans in the late 1850s caused the Whig Party to collapse.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P1'>Republicans ran their first presidential candidate in 1856, John C. Frémont. He lost to Democratic candidate James Buchanan, but came in second in a three-way race, winning 11 northern states. Republicans did win congressional and some state elections, and by the 1860 presidential election had established themselves as the most dominant party within the free states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P2'>The Republican Party nominated Abraham Lincoln for president in 1860. The party’s platform included the declaration that “the normal condition of all the territory of the United States is that of freedom,” and included several other criticisms of slavery. Lincoln and the Republican Party clarified that the federal government could not interfere with slavery in the southern states, but their overt anti-slavery position alarmed southerners who saw the Republicans as a fundamental threat to southern way of life. Southern politicians warned of disunion should Lincoln win, and the 1860 election turned into a contest among four candidates. The Democratic Party split along north-south sectional lines, and Lincoln did not appear on presidential ballots in most slaveholding states. Still, Lincoln and the Republicans won the 1860 presidential election with only northern (free state) votes. The election victory sparked a secessionist movement in the south, even before Lincoln took office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P3'>Lincoln and the Republican Party led the federal government against secession and through the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865. The party fractured some during the war over differences of abolition and punishment of the south. Party members who harbored greater interests in abolition, African American rights, and punishing Confederates became known as the Radical Republicans. Lincoln remained more moderate. He advocated more leniency to former Confederates, and was slower to adopt policies that forced social change within the country.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P4'>When Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, Radical Republicans sought to punish the south and enforce their more extreme policies. Andrew Johnson, the vice president who entered the presidency upon Lincoln’s death, opposed the Radicals. However, his policies frustrated many moderate Republicans, and the party took a more forceful role in southern civil and political affairs when former Confederates tried to limit the rights of African Americans during Reconstruction. The Republican Party had a presence within the south during Reconstruction, but mostly among African Americans and northerners who traveled south for political or economic reasons. The party was still seen by most white southerners as a northern party oppressing the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P5'>By 1868 most of the Republican Party had turned on Johnson, even impeaching him. War hero Ulysses S. Grant was then elected as the Republican Party candidate in 1868 with support from the radicals. His administration faced accusations of corruption, especially in the south and the west. By the 1876 election, national support for Reconstruction was low, and initial voter counts appeared to show the Democratic candidate the winner. Republicans in Congress complained of voter intimidation in the south and after tense political negotiations with Democrats managed to have the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes declared the winner with the agreement to end Reconstruction in the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P6'>The Republican Party continues to be one of the top two political parties in the United States. (Wikipedia)

<p corresp='TTP25134967P3' xml:id='OTP25134967P3'>Col <rs ref='#S25023929'>Grimer?</rs> called to see upon his return from your State, and requested that I would inform you in regard to a recent purchase of Arms for this State from [?].
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25134967P4' xml:id='OTP25134967P4'>Early in November the Commissioner who had been entrusted with the purchase of arms, learned that there were 10000 stands of [?] original smooth bore Army muskets for sale by [?] Gov at <rs ref='#S90650'>Harpers ferry Arsenal</rs>, and determined [?] [?] purchase them. I accompaned one of the Commissioners who was [directed?] by the <rs ref='#S78266'>Board</rs> for that purpose, to the <rs ref='#S99586'>Secretary of War</rs> but we found that the rumor was unfounded and that Mr. [?] had no authority to sell them.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25134967P5' xml:id='OTP25134967P5'>We found in the <rs ref='#S55257'>Arsenal</rs> at <rs ref='#S25001718'>Washington</rs>, a considerable number of allowed percussion musket for sale at $2 50 per stand—handsome &amp; excellent Arms, @ 5000 of these were purchased for the State at $2 50 A number remain for sale, and if you are in want of muskets I think the opportunity is worthy of your attention. In case of a purchase, it would be adviseable to send on an officer of experience to select them, and if desired, the same officer this State who was sent upon me [?] since could accompany him from here.
