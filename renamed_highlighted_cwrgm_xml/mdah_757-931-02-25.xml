                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71503P0'>Francis Wilkinson Pickens was a politician and governor of South Carolina during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P1'>Born on April 7, 1805 (or 1897), in Togadoo, South Carolina, Pickens was the son of a former South Carolina governor and the grandson of American Revolutionary War hero General Andrew Pickens. He was well educated, attending Franklin College (part of modern-day University of Georgia) and South Carolina College before becoming a practicing attorney in 1829. Soon afterwards he became active in politics, serving in the South Carolina House of Representatives in the early 1830s. His term in state office came about during the Nullification Crisis, when notable South Carolina politicians, including one of Pickens’s distant cousins John C. Calhoun, threatened to nullify an unpopular federal tariff law that benefitted northern interests. The political debate was hotly debated within the United States and was one of the first efforts by a state to directly challenge federal authority in the United States. It sparked talk of secession within South Carolina. Pickens supported nullification, but the issue quieted down after several months due to compromise efforts by some in Congress, and since few other southern states had fully backed South Carolina’s threats of nullification and secession.  (President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently opposed South Carolina’s action, tempering many attitudes in the souths.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P2'>Pickens’s political career continued to grow in the 1830s. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from 1834 to 1843. He was offered to be Minister to England by President James K. Polk, and then later offered to be Minister to France by President James Buchanan. He turned both of those offers down, but did accept an appointment to be Minister to Russia in 1858. He spent two years in that country, becoming friends with Czar Alexander II.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P3'>In 1860, Pickens was elected governor of South Carolina. Almost immediately after he entered office, his state voted to separate from the Union due to Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. Pickens was less radical about secession than many of his fellow South Carolinians in 1860. He wished to avoid war, but was largely carried forward by events beyond his control. He complained to federal authorities about the occupation of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor by U.S. Army troops, and approved the use of force against a Union ship, the <hi rend='italic'>Star of the West</hi>, sent to provide supplies to Fort Sumter in January 1861. As tensions mounted over the stand off at Fort Sumter, Pickens felt tremendous pressure and authorized the overall bombardment of the fort by Confederate forces in April 1861. He remained governor until December 1862, and then returned to his home in Edgefield, South Carolina, for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P4'>After the Civil War ended, Pickens was elected to be a delegate to a state constitutional convention in September 1865. He introduced a resolution to repeal South Carolina’s 1860 ordinance of secession, a matter deemed necessary for the state to resume its normal political position within the Union. He reportedly encouraged his fellow South Carolinians to embrace peace after the Confederacy’s defeat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P5'>Pickens lost most of his personal wealth during the Civil War. He died on January 25, 1869. He was married three times. His first wife was Margaret Simkins. She passed away in 1842. He married Marion Antoinette Dearing in 1845, but she died in 1853. His third, and final, wife was Lucy Petway Holcombe, whom he married in 1858. He had at least eight children. Pickens is buried in Edgefield Village Cemetery in Edgefield, South Carolina.
