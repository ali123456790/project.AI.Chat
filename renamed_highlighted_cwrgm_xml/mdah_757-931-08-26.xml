                    <p xml:id='OTPS75066P0'>Andrew Jackson was a general in the U.S. Army, U.S. Congressman, and the seventh President of the United States (1829-1837).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P1'>Born on March 15, 1767 in Lancaster County, South Carolina, Jackson was a member of the South Carolina militia during the American Revolutionary War, fighting against the British. After the war, he became a lawyer in September 1787. He moved to the western district of North Carolina, which became the state of Tennessee in 1796. Jackson settled in Nashville, where he worked as a lawyer and was appointed attorney general in 1791.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P2'>Jackson became involved in politics in the 1790s as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he was elected as one of Tennessee’s first U.S. Representatives in 1796. He also served as a U.S. senator for six months in 1797 and was a judge on the Tennessee Superior Court from 1798 to 1804. Afterwards, he became a successful planter and merchant and was the enslaver of at least three hundred enslaved men, women and children during his lifetime. He was also active in the domestic slave trade.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P3'>During the War of 1812, Jackson served as a brigadier general in the U.S. Army. He earned the nickname “Hickory” (later “Old Hickory”) for his formidable leadership during the war and for his success against the Red Sticks, a Creek Confederacy allied with the British. Jackson was also made a brevet major general. However, it was his victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans in December 1814 that catapulted him to national fame. For this victory, he was given a Congressional Gold Medal, which is the highest civilian award in the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P4'>Following the war, Jackson maintained his command but was allowed to make his headquarters at the Hermitage, his home in Tennessee. He was instrumental in forcing Native American tribes, including the Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and the Seminole to cede tens of millions of acres of land to the United States, especially following the First Seminole War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P5'>Due to the Panic of 1819, Congress reduced the size of the military, ending Jackson’s generalship. Afterwards, he served two months as the first territorial governor of Florida in 1821, and he became a U.S. Senator again in 1823. In the 1824, he was the Democratic-Republican Party’s Presidential nominee, and he won more electoral votes than any of the four candidates, although he did not win the majority. Under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment, the vote then went to the House of Representatives. In what Jackson’s supporters called the “corrupt bargain,” Henry Clay, who had been one of the candidates, threw his support behind John Quincy Adams, which culminated in Adams’s victory. Adams then appointed Clay as his Secretary of State.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P6'>Afterwards, Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee where he formed a new political party, the Democratic Party, vowing to crush Adams in the next election. Jackson depicted himself as a champion of the ordinary citizen and was nominated for the Presidency again in 1828. He won a sound victory with 58% of the popular vote and 68% of the electoral vote, and he won again in 1832, serving until 1837.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P7'>Highlights of Jackson’s Presidency include his Kitchen Cabinet, an unofficial group of advisors that Jackson turned to over his own cabinet, the spoils system, by which federal employees could be replaced by loyal Democrats, and the Bank War, within which Jackson challenged the national banking system. Jackson is also the only U.S. President to pay off the national debt in 1835. Jackson is also responsible for the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and for the systematic removal of Native American tribes in the east to territories west of the Mississippi river.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P8'>In 1832, John C. Calhoun and South Carolina threatened to “nullify” the Tariff of 1832 on the grounds that the union was a compact of individual states. This argument went so far as to suggest secession as a viable option. Jackson responded aggressively by sending troops to South Carolina and by passing the “Force Bill”, which authorized the military to enforce congressional laws. In effect, he rejected the “right” of secession and forced Calhoun to resign as his vice president. Jackson’s expansion of executive power throughout his presidency led to the birth of the Whig Party, and his opponents nicknamed him “King Andrew the First.” After his presidency, Jackson returned to his home in Nashville, where he remained active in politics. This included lobbying for the annexation of Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P9'>Jackson was married to Rachel (Donelson) Jackson, the divorcee of Captain Lewis Robards. Andrew and Rachel Jackson did not have any children, but they adopted Rachel’s nephews, including Andrew Jackson Jr. The couple also acted as guardians to other children, including three who were indigenous, Lyncoya, Theodore, and Charley. Rachel Jackson died in 1828 just before Jackson became president. Jackson died on June 8, 1845 in his home, the Hermitage in Davidson County, Tennessee. He was buried in the Jackson Family Cemetery at the Hermitage.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
