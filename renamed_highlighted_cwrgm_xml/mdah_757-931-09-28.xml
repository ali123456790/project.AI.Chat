                    <p xml:id='OTPS74453P0'>Robert Lowry was a Confederate officer and later governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74453P1'>Born on March 10, 1829, in Chesterfield District, South Carolina, Lowry grew up in Mississippi. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in Brandon, Mississippi. At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, he volunteered for military service and rose to command the Sixth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, but returned to duty. In 1864, Lowry was among Confederate forces sent to put down an uprising by anti-secessionist Mississippians in Jones County. Later, he received command of a brigade in the Army of Tennessee, and was promoted to brigadier general in February 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74453P2'>After the Civil War, Lowry returned to Brandon to practice law.  He also became involved in state politics, winning an election to the Mississippi Senate in 1865 and serving one term. While he did not serve in elected office for several more years, Lowry became a powerful figure in the state’s Democratic Party, winning election to governor in 1881. He served two four-year terms, helping restore white supremacy in Mississippi following the end of Reconstruction. He left office at the end of his second term, in 1890. Lowry died in 1910 at the age of 80. He was married to Maria Miller Gammage and had nine children. Lowry is buried at Brandon Cemetery in Brandon, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS73895P0'>Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard was an educator and university administrator during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P1'>Born on May 5, 1809, in Sheffield, Massachusetts, Barnard studied astronomy at Yale University and graduated there in 1828. He remained in the university system, as a tutor and then instructor, teaching at the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in Connecticut. Barnard and many members of his family suffered from a hereditary form of hearing loss which grew worse through his life. In the late 1830s, he accepted a position at the University of Alabama, teaching a variety of courses, including mathematics, natural philosophy, natural history, and chemistry, until 1854. He then transferred to the University of Mississippi, working initially as a professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, and then accepting a promotion as chancellor in 1856. While a well-respected academic in the south, Barnard held more egalitarian views than his colleagues there. For instance, he drew criticism from southern officials for his acceptance of testimony of a female slave against a white student who reportedly had assaulted her. He also championed equal education opportunities regardless of gender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Barnard resigned from the University of Mississippi due to his Unionist sympathies. He spent the next few years working on various scientific projects before being selected in 1864 to serve as the president of Columbia College (modern-day Columbia University) in New York. He remained in that position until he died in 1889. He expanded the number of departments and improved opportunity for research. During the course of Barnard’s twenty-five year tenure at Columbia, the school’s enrollment grew from 150 to 1,000 students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P3'>Barnard passed away on April 27, 1889, in New York City. He was married to Margaret McMurray. He is buried in Center Cemetery in Sheffield, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS70283P0'>Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar, II (or Jr.),  was an attorney, politician, Confederate officer, and U.S. Supreme Court justice during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P1'>Born on September 17, 1825, near Eatonton, Georgia, Lamar was born to a prominent family, including a father (and namesake) who was an attorney and judge, an uncle who was the second president of the Republic of Texas, and two cousins who were justices on the Supreme Court. Lamar attended various schools, including Emory College (modern-day Emory University), before becoming a practicing attorney in Vienna, Georgia, in 1847. He quickly entered politics, aided by his family connections and name, and participated in various Democratic Party conventions.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P2'>In 1849, Lamar moved to Oxford, Mississippi, and began teaching mathematics at the University of Mississippi. He accumulated land and wealth in Mississippi, including an increasing number of slaves, and again sought political office. In 1851, he helped organize a branch of the Southern Rights Party—a fiercely pro-slavery, states rights movement—in Oxford and supported Jefferson Davis’s bid for governor of Mississippi. After Davis lost to Unionist Henry Foote, Lamar moved back to Georgia and found a friendlier reception to his political goals, winning a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives in the mid-1850s. When he lost a second bid for political office in 1855, Lamar moved back to Mississippi and established a thousand-acre cotton plantation near Holly Springs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P3'>In 1857, Lamar won election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Mississippi in 1857. He became an outspoken defender of southern slaveholding interests, participating in several verbal and physical confrontations during the tense political debates in Washington, D.C., during the latter part of the 1850s. After Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election, Lamar participated in Mississippi’s secession convention and then resigned his congressional seat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P4'>In the spring of 1861, Lamar volunteered for military service.  He helped raise the Nineteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment and was commissioned a lieutenant colonel. He suffered from health problems which interrupted his field service, although he did participate in the Battle of Williamsburg in Virginia. In 1862, Lamar was appointed to be a diplomat to the Russian Imperial Government. He traveled to Europe but was not successful in recruiting Russian support for the Confederacy. His efforts to generate support in England and France were also fruitless. Lamar returned to the Confederacy in 1864 and variously served as a judge advocate (attorney) in the Confederate army and as a staff officer to General James Longstreet.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P5'>After the Civil War, Lamar returned to Mississippi. He had lost most of his land and wealth, as well as family members and two previous law partners, to the war. He established a new law firm in 1865, but it lasted only one year before he took a teaching position at the University of Mississippi. While a professor there in the late 1860s, Lamar slowly began to rebuild his personal wealth by working with the Mississippi Central Railroad Company and doing legal work on the side. In 1870, he resigned from the university—in part due to fear that African American students would be admitted under a new school administration—and became an outspoken critic of Republican Reconstruction and Black civil rights. He had his law license temporarily revoked in Mississippi when he assaulted a witness and cussed at the judge and the U.S. federal government in a trial against the Ku Klux Klan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P6'>Lamar’s vehement opposition to Reconstruction boosted his political career. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1873—the first Democrat from Mississippi to serve in Congress since the Civil War—and then won election to the U.S. Senate in 1877. He retained his highly discriminatory views that African Americans were not equal to white people. These views did not compromise his political future after Reconstruction ended in 1877, and Lamar was appointed Secretary of the Interior in 1885 by President Grover Cleveland. In that role, he advocated conservation of natural resources and worked to reclaim millions of acres held by railroad corporations. He also advocated Native American citizenship and land holding.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P7'>In 1888, at 62 years old, Lamar was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although most Republicans opposed his appointment, he received the position by a slim majority vote. His time on the Court was uncontroversial and he served until his death on January 23, 1893. Lamar was married twice during his lifetime. His first was, Virginia Longstreet, died in 1884. He then married Henrietta Dean in 1887. He had at least four children who survived to adulthood. Lamar is buried in Oxford Memorial Cemetery in Oxford, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73894P0'>In the United States in the nineteenth century, most college students, with few exceptions, were white males from elite families. Few universities admitted women or African Americans. The nation's earliest universities were established by Christian denominations, but college education, however, often served as much to provide social and cultural capital for aspiring social elites as much as practical knowledge (Roger L. Geiger, <hi rend='italic'>The History of American Higher Education</hi>, 267). From their findings throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, American universities exposed college students primarily to classical liberal arts curricula, including classical languages, logic, and the natural sciences, though that education expanded to broader subjects throughout the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73894P1'>Many colleges and universities, especially but not exclusively in the South, built their schools and supported their white student populations with enslaved labor. In many universities in slave states, students brought enslaved persons with them to universities. American colleges and universities, as well as their students, therefore profited from the enslaved labor of African Americans while institutionalizing educational and wealth inequality between white and Black Americans as well as between men and women of both races. However, other colleges, such as Oberlin College in Ohio, admitted women and African Americans even in the antebellum period.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73894P2'>In 1862, the Morrill Land Grant Act set aside federal property to be used to establish colleges devoted to agricultural and mechanical studies, broadening both the student population and curriculum of American universities. After Emancipation, many African Americans established colleges and universities across the nation, now known as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to increase Black Americans' access to higher education, though the full integration of higher education in the nation would not come until a century later during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s (Roger L. Geiger, <hi rend='italic'>The History of American Higher Education</hi>; Wikipedia).

There seems a special necessity for prevent=ing such association in the present case, inasmuch as the cause of the expulsion was a defiance of authority which renders the continuance of any relations of the offender with the remaining students par=ticularly dangerous.
