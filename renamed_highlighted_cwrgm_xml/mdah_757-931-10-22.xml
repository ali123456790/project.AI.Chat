                    <p xml:id='OTPS76212P0'>LeRoy Pope Walker was the first Secretary of War for the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P1'>Born on February 7, 1817, near Huntsville, Alabama, Walker received a private education before attending the University of Alabama and then the University of Virginia in the 1830s. He studied law and became an attorney before turning 21 years old. Coming from an influential family in Alabama, Walker held various public offices in the state in the 1840s, including serving as a circuit court judge.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P2'>Walker was an outspoken advocate of secession during the 1850s. Following Alabama’s secession in early 1861, Confederate president Jefferson Davis appointed Walker as Secretary of War. He also served as a secession commissioner from Alabama to Tennessee, in an effort to draw the latter state into the Confederacy. Among his most notable actions as a Confederate cabinet member were public speeches in which he made bold—and very wrong—predictions about the fate of the Confederacy. Early in his tenure he rejected the prospect of large war between the Union and the Confederacy, famously claiming he would wipe up all the blood spilled with his handkerchief. After the firing on Fort Sumter and the sudden rush to war, Walker made another speech prophesizing a Confederate flag waving over the White House in Washington, D.C. By the late summer of 1861 he suffered health problems from work-related stress. President Davis offered him the opportunity to travel to Europe as a representative of the Confederate government, but Walker declined. He stepped down as secretary in September 1861, but accepted a commission as brigadier general in the Confederacy army and (despite no military experience) commanded troops at military forts and posts in Alabama. He resigned his commission in March 1862, but returned to the military in April 1864 to serve as a military judge.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P3'>Following the Civil War, Walker was active in opposing Republican Reconstruction in Alabama, including serving as president of the Alabama constitutional convention in 1875 that overturned Reconstruction policies. Following Reconstruction, he worked as an attorney in Alabama. He died on August 23, 1884. Walker was married twice, first to a Miss Hopkins who passed away after bearing him two children. He then married Eliza Dickson Pickett and had three more children. Walker is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71951P0'>James Ronald Chalmers was a Confederate officer and served as a U.S. Representative for Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P1'>Born in Halifax County, Virginia, on January 11, 1831, Chalmers moved with his family to Mississippi during his youth, settling in Holly Springs. After graduating from South Carolina College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in Holly Springs in 1853. Five years later, he was elected district attorney. He was selected as a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in 1861, and helped pass the ordinance of secession which declared the state separate from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P2'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, Chalmers volunteered for military service. He was first commissioned as a captain the Confederate army and soon received a promotion to colonel of the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. After commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida, Chalmers was promoted again, to brigadier general. He performed well during the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and again during the Battle of Murfreesboro from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. In 1864, he fought in western Tennessee, including the Battle of Fort Pillow, which involved Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest murdering several African American Union prisoners. In 1865, he was placed in charge of all Mississippi cavalry in the Mississippi and western Tennessee region. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P3'>After the Civil War, Chalmers returned to Mississippi and resumed practicing law. He gained fame among white conservatives through his opposition to Republican Reconstruction, and led an armed group of Democrats to Friar’s Point in 1876 to chase away the sheriff and intimidate African Americans in the area. That same year he won a state senate seat. When Mississippi was readmitted to the Union, Chalmers won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1877 to 1880. Although he again won reelection in 1880, his Republican opponent, John R. Lynch, disputed the election results. A Congressional investigation found in favor for Lynch, but not until 1882 after Chalmers had served most of the term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P4'>Around 1882, Chalmers broke with the traditional Democratic Party in Mississippi. He ran for reelection in 1882, but as an Independent Democrat with support from some Republicans and the Greenback Party (which was a third-party political movement that focused on economic matters). A traditional Democrat candidate, Van H. Manning, won the election, but this time Chalmers contested the results. Congress decided in Chalmer’s favor and he reentered Congress in June 1884, but lost reelection later that fall.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P5'>Chalmers returned to practicing law after the 1884 election. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and died on April 29, 1882. He had been married to Rebecca Arthur; the couple had two children. Chalmers is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.

I left <rs ref='#S63133'>Nashville Tenn</rs>. my home and settled here in 1858 Since Davis has proved himself the greatest man the South or North ever produced; and Tennessee failed to go out with us, the Captain of my former Companies wrote me to come and take them to join the Southern Army.

My men were presented to Mississippi merely to be transfered, at once, to the Southern Army; then this State could fill up her quota again, for we would belong to the Southern Army and not to Mississippi. This I presumed would be un-derstood by you. I merely asked the favor of a pass through your great State.
