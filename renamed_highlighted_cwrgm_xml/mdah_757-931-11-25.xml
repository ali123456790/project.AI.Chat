                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD93397P0'>An epidemic is the increase in disease cases in a specific geographical area or population. Epidemics have affected communities throughout history and are caused by many different factors, such as contaminated water or food, mosquitos or other parasites, and interpersonal transmission. Epidemics frequently occur in highly populated areas, where diseases can spread rapidly before victims succumb to the illness or recover preventing further transmission.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P1'>Numerous epidemics occurred during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Most occurred within the large Union and Confederate armies, where thousands of soldiers lived in close proximity to each other, often in unsanitary conditions. The most common illnesses associated to epidemics were diarrhea, typhoid, malaria, yellow fever, measles, and smallpox.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P2'>Diarrhea (or dysentery, which was when blood was present in the stool) and typhoid spread through contaminated food or water. Since soldiers often shared sources of food and water, any bacteria or parasites present frequently afflicted many individuals around the same time.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P3'>Malaria and yellow fever were transmitted by mosquitos, who picked up the viruses from one person and infected another. This form of transmission often led to small epidemics within a group. Some nineteenth century construction projects, especially during the Civil War, exacerbated the problem by ignoring drainage measures and creating pools of stagnant water perfect for mosquito breeding. Ulysses S. Grant’s campaign in late 1862 and early 1863 to carve canals through the swamp west of Vicksburg, Mississippi, likely increased the mosquito population in that region. The large number of soldiers and laborers involved in the project further gave the parasites a steady food source and a substantial number of victims for the pathogen.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P4'>Measles and smallpox were highly contagious diseases that spread from person to person. Military activities during Civil War and social changes from the disruption and end of slavery caused various outbreaks of the diseases. The mobilization of thousands of soldiers brought together individuals previously isolated from certain disease, and therefore had no immunity. Similarly, as Union armies marched through the south, thousands of fugitive slaves and freed people left their small communities and sought safety or work in refugee camps or cities, unintentionally exposing themselves to new diseases.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P5'>Epidemics were most problematic when soldiers or civilians lived in austere conditions. Prisoners of war were among the most susceptible to disease outbreaks, since many prison camps were overcrowded, suffered from poor sanitation, and did not provide high enough quality or quantity of food for the prisoners to remain healthy. Dietary deficiencies, even in regular army camps, caused epidemics. Cases of scurvy, a severe lack of Vitamin C, increased to epidemic proportions when soldiers lacked fruits and vegetables for long periods of time.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P6'>Medical care improved some during the Civil War and Reconstruction era, as physicians began to see greater value in improving sanitation, sunlight, and airflow in hospitals. However, misinformation and misunderstanding of disease sources and transmission methods meant that medical personnel rarely managed to prevent epidemics. Most medical care during this era was responsive to outbreaks, rather than preventive measures.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P7'>Most people survived the epidemics described above. Nevertheless, outbreaks reduced the number of healthy soldiers ready for campaign or combat, and many individual victims never fully recovered from diseases they acquired during epidemics.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92472P0'>A vaccination is a treatment designed to stimulate a person’s immunity to a certain disease by exposure to a weakened or inactive form of that disease (or vaccine). During the early nineteenth century, most physicians did not understand viruses or bacteria, or how various diseases spread. The one notable exception was smallpox. Because the disease caused frequent outbreaks and its symptoms were easily diagnosed, physicians as early as the 1720s had recognized that it spread from person to person. They developed a system of inoculation, which involved taking pus or scabs from an infected person (usually one with mild symptoms) and introducing them to a healthy patient through small cuts made in the skin. This process was dangerous, as it introduced the actual smallpox pathogens to the patient, and could result in severe illness. Nevertheless, the practice reduced the death rate of smallpox compared to natural outbreaks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92472P1'>In 1798, Edward Jenner developed a true vaccination for smallpox. Instead of administering actual smallpox pathogens, Jenner’s vaccination used cowpox serum, a virus related to smallpox but much less harmful to humans. The human body’s response to cowpox results in an immunity to smallpox. Vaccination required obtaining the cowpox virus from infected animals and introducing it to the human patient in the same way as the inoculation—small cuts in the skin. By the mid-nineteenth century, vaccination was the standard method of preventing smallpox. In fact, many states outlawed inoculation since patients vaccinated with cowpox were not infectious to other people, while the inoculated could spread smallpox unwittingly.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92472P2'>The success of vaccinations reduced outbreaks, which in turn lessened concern of smallpox as a public health matter. Fewer Americans received vaccinations in the 1840s and 1850s than previous generations. When the Civil War began in 1861, most soldiers in military camps had not been vaccinated, nor had immunity from natural exposure. The results were devastating to both Union and Confederate armies, as small outbreaks sickened hundreds of thousands, killing many.

<p xml:id='OTPSD92472P3'>The sudden need for vaccinations in army camps also led to faulty vaccination efforts. Unable to always source cows for cowpox, some physicians used samples from the scabs of other people, and especially children, who had been vaccinated. Worse, some soldiers vaccinated each other without any medical supervision, which led to new outbreaks or severe symptoms as the viruses being shared were often actual smallpox or other mysterious diseases. Problems with vaccinations in the south led to wide public distrust in the practice during and after the war.

<p xml:id='OTPSD92472P4'>After the Civil War, the medical community benefitted from the vast number of writings and studies by Union and Confederate surgeons of lessons learned in the field. Smallpox continued to be a public health problem during Reconstruction and afterwards, but improvements in vaccines and vaccination practices saved countless lives. (Frank R. Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 79–81; Laura Elizabeth Smith, Allen Driggers, and Cheyenne L. Douthitt, “History politics, and variolation vaccination hesitancy in the American South during the American Civil War,” <hi rend='italic'>Proceedings [Baylor University.
