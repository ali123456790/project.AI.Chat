                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71503P0'>Francis Wilkinson Pickens was a politician and governor of South Carolina during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P1'>Born on April 7, 1805 (or 1897), in Togadoo, South Carolina, Pickens was the son of a former South Carolina governor and the grandson of American Revolutionary War hero General Andrew Pickens. He was well educated, attending Franklin College (part of modern-day University of Georgia) and South Carolina College before becoming a practicing attorney in 1829. Soon afterwards he became active in politics, serving in the South Carolina House of Representatives in the early 1830s. His term in state office came about during the Nullification Crisis, when notable South Carolina politicians, including one of Pickens’s distant cousins John C. Calhoun, threatened to nullify an unpopular federal tariff law that benefitted northern interests. The political debate was hotly debated within the United States and was one of the first efforts by a state to directly challenge federal authority in the United States. It sparked talk of secession within South Carolina. Pickens supported nullification, but the issue quieted down after several months due to compromise efforts by some in Congress, and since few other southern states had fully backed South Carolina’s threats of nullification and secession.  (President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently opposed South Carolina’s action, tempering many attitudes in the souths.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P2'>Pickens’s political career continued to grow in the 1830s. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from 1834 to 1843. He was offered to be Minister to England by President James K. Polk, and then later offered to be Minister to France by President James Buchanan. He turned both of those offers down, but did accept an appointment to be Minister to Russia in 1858. He spent two years in that country, becoming friends with Czar Alexander II.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P3'>In 1860, Pickens was elected governor of South Carolina. Almost immediately after he entered office, his state voted to separate from the Union due to Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. Pickens was less radical about secession than many of his fellow South Carolinians in 1860. He wished to avoid war, but was largely carried forward by events beyond his control. He complained to federal authorities about the occupation of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor by U.S. Army troops, and approved the use of force against a Union ship, the <hi rend='italic'>Star of the West</hi>, sent to provide supplies to Fort Sumter in January 1861. As tensions mounted over the stand off at Fort Sumter, Pickens felt tremendous pressure and authorized the overall bombardment of the fort by Confederate forces in April 1861. He remained governor until December 1862, and then returned to his home in Edgefield, South Carolina, for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P4'>After the Civil War ended, Pickens was elected to be a delegate to a state constitutional convention in September 1865. He introduced a resolution to repeal South Carolina’s 1860 ordinance of secession, a matter deemed necessary for the state to resume its normal political position within the Union. He reportedly encouraged his fellow South Carolinians to embrace peace after the Confederacy’s defeat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P5'>Pickens lost most of his personal wealth during the Civil War. He died on January 25, 1869. He was married three times. His first wife was Margaret Simkins. She passed away in 1842. He married Marion Antoinette Dearing in 1845, but she died in 1853. His third, and final, wife was Lucy Petway Holcombe, whom he married in 1858. He had at least eight children. Pickens is buried in Edgefield Village Cemetery in Edgefield, South Carolina.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99666P0'>In warfare, an army moving into an enemy’s home territory is often described as an invasion. During the American Civil War, most examples of military forces moving into enemy territory involved Union armies advancing into Confederate states. Some of these incursions were temporary, such as small cavalry raids to destroy Confederate supplies and even larger campaigns behind Confederate lines to harm Southern infrastructure (such as William T. Sherman’s “March Through Georgia”). However, Union victory in the Civil War depended upon the United States Army conducting offensive operations and occupying large portions of the South. These efforts split apart the Confederacy, placed secessionist communities back under federal control, and reduced the Confederate armies’ ability to wage war. Pro-secessionist Southerners considered these efforts to be federal invasions, and described communities captured by Union armies as being overrun. However, pro-Union Southerners cheered the arrival of Union soldiers, considering them liberators rather than invaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99666P1'>Although the Confederacy fought a defensive war, Southern military forces occasionally conducted incursions into northern communities. Robert E. Lee’s Maryland Campaign in 1862 (which culminated in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862) was seen by many Marylanders as an invasion of their state. His second offensive campaign into the North, in the summer of 1863, was widely reported in the Northern press as a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. That campaign ultimately resulted in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD78266P0'>Shortly after declaring the state of Mississippi separated from the United States in January 1861, its secession convention passed an order entitled “An Ordinance to Regulate the Military System of the State of Mississippi.” This ordinance created a Military Board to oversee Mississippi’s military personnel and resources. This board was to be made up of four brigadier generals and a major general in charge of the state’s militia, and the governor. On January 23, the convention elected the board members as Jefferson Davis (as major general) and Earl Van Dorn, Charles Clark, James L. Alcorn, and Christopher H. Mott (as brigadier generals). Shortly thereafter, the Military Board met to build and prepare Mississippi’s armed forces. It appointed Richard Griffith to the position of adjutant general, Samuel G. French to oversee the ordnance requirements, and William Barksdale for the quartermaster general. With appointments complete, the board then published instructions for Mississippi’s military structure, procedures, tactics, and equipment in the form of <hi rend='italic'>Orders of the Military Board of the State of Mississippi</hi>. Over the next several weeks, the board handled a wide variety of strategic and administrative tasks, such as planning the defense of Mississippi’s coastline and facilitating the purchase of rations and weapons for Mississippi troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD78266P1'>Although the Military Board began well, it soon ran into problems. Many of its members vacated their positions for promotions into Confederate service. Davis was elected president of the Confederacy, and the brigadier generals took military positions within the Confederate army. Mississippi officials appointed new generals to take their place on the Military Board, but the governor’s dislike of Alcorn caused controversy and led to another individual—Reuben Davis—being promoted to major general. Additional problems arose when most of Mississippi ‘s troops and equipment were transferred into Confederate service. Continued enlistments into that army prevented the state’s militia force from maintaining a steady number or presence. The Military Board spent much of its time during the summer of 1861 trying to procure sufficient weapons and soldiers for state service. By the fall, Mississippi officials believed that the Military Board was an inefficient method of governing the militia. The board was discontinued in November 1861. (Timothy B. Smith, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi in the Civil War</hi>, 52–60)

<p corresp='TTP1643777P2' xml:id='OTP1643777P2'>Sir—In view of the fact that an <rs ref='#S99666'>invasion</rs> of your state is most to be apprehended by way of the <rs ref='#S63143'>Mississippi river</rs>, and that the people of Tennessee and Kentucky will oppose it as our own, and with all this power, the opinion of the members of our <rs ref='#S78266'>Military Board</rs> is, that the most important points of defense are <rs ref='#S75592'>Columbus</rs>, [?], Memphis, and such available positions as can be taken on the op-posite shore. We have the men, and can probably command the men of the [?] arms, and also the ammunition, but we are deficient in such large guns—32 and 24 pounders—as are required for our battaries on the river banks. A dispatch from Gov. <rs ref='#S71503'>Pickens</rs>, just now, suggests that we may obtain them at <rs ref='#S70523'>Norfolk</rs>, when our agent is out; but should we fail, as we have failed hitherto, a strong effort will be made for some of your guns at <rs ref='#S51788'>Vicksburg</rs>, where a battery will be useless if we are to put our defenses in proper conditions between <rs ref='#S77291'>Cairo</rs> and Memphis.
