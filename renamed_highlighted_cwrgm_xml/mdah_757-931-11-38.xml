                    <p xml:id='OTPS73895P0'>Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard was an educator and university administrator during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P1'>Born on May 5, 1809, in Sheffield, Massachusetts, Barnard studied astronomy at Yale University and graduated there in 1828. He remained in the university system, as a tutor and then instructor, teaching at the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in Connecticut. Barnard and many members of his family suffered from a hereditary form of hearing loss which grew worse through his life. In the late 1830s, he accepted a position at the University of Alabama, teaching a variety of courses, including mathematics, natural philosophy, natural history, and chemistry, until 1854. He then transferred to the University of Mississippi, working initially as a professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, and then accepting a promotion as chancellor in 1856. While a well-respected academic in the south, Barnard held more egalitarian views than his colleagues there. For instance, he drew criticism from southern officials for his acceptance of testimony of a female slave against a white student who reportedly had assaulted her. He also championed equal education opportunities regardless of gender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Barnard resigned from the University of Mississippi due to his Unionist sympathies. He spent the next few years working on various scientific projects before being selected in 1864 to serve as the president of Columbia College (modern-day Columbia University) in New York. He remained in that position until he died in 1889. He expanded the number of departments and improved opportunity for research. During the course of Barnard’s twenty-five year tenure at Columbia, the school’s enrollment grew from 150 to 1,000 students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P3'>Barnard passed away on April 27, 1889, in New York City. He was married to Margaret McMurray. He is buried in Center Cemetery in Sheffield, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS77327P0'>William Mercer Green served as the first Episcopal bishop of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS77327P1'>Born on May 2, 1798, in Wilmington, North Carolina, Green graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1818 and became a deacon in the Episcopal church in 1821. He continued his religious studies and became an ordained priest in 1823. He spent two decades leading various churches in North Carolina before pursuing an advanced degree, receiving a Doctorate in Divinity from the University of Pennsylvania in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS77327P2'>In 1849, Green became the first bishop of the diocese of Mississippi and the 51st bishop of the Episcopal Church of the United States. Beyond growing the Episcopal Church in Mississippi over the next ten years, Green helped found the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. He continued his religious duties during the Civil War, but evacuated Jackson, Mississippi, when Union troops captured the city in 1863. When he returned to Jackson, he found his church had been destroyed.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS77327P3'>Green remained bishop in Mississippi until well after the war ended. He handed over some of his duties to a coadjutor bishop in 1882 due to poor health. He passed away on February 13, 1887. Green was married twice, first to Sarah Williams, with whom he had five children. She died in 1832. He then married Charlotte Fleming and had eight more children. Green in buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73894P0'>In the United States in the nineteenth century, most college students, with few exceptions, were white males from elite families. Few universities admitted women or African Americans. The nation's earliest universities were established by Christian denominations, but college education, however, often served as much to provide social and cultural capital for aspiring social elites as much as practical knowledge (Roger L. Geiger, <hi rend='italic'>The History of American Higher Education</hi>, 267). From their findings throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, American universities exposed college students primarily to classical liberal arts curricula, including classical languages, logic, and the natural sciences, though that education expanded to broader subjects throughout the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73894P1'>Many colleges and universities, especially but not exclusively in the South, built their schools and supported their white student populations with enslaved labor. In many universities in slave states, students brought enslaved persons with them to universities. American colleges and universities, as well as their students, therefore profited from the enslaved labor of African Americans while institutionalizing educational and wealth inequality between white and Black Americans as well as between men and women of both races. However, other colleges, such as Oberlin College in Ohio, admitted women and African Americans even in the antebellum period.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73894P2'>In 1862, the Morrill Land Grant Act set aside federal property to be used to establish colleges devoted to agricultural and mechanical studies, broadening both the student population and curriculum of American universities. After Emancipation, many African Americans established colleges and universities across the nation, now known as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to increase Black Americans' access to higher education, though the full integration of higher education in the nation would not come until a century later during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s (Roger L. Geiger, <hi rend='italic'>The History of American Higher Education</hi>; Wikipedia).
