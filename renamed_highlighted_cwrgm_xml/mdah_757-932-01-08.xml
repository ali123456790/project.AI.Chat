                    <p xml:id='OTPS52243P0'>Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth president of the United States, whose election to the White House as an anti-slavery Republican in 1860 led several southern states to declare themselves separate from the Union and create the Confederate States of America. Lincoln was commander-in-chief of Union forces during the Civil War. Over the course of four years, Lincoln oversaw the Union war effort and took steps to end the institution of slavery to aid the federal military effort and destroy the root cause of the north versus south sectional conflict.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P1'>Born on February 12, 1809, near Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln moved with is family to Indiana as a child and grew up in a poor, frontier society. Although he received minimal formal education, Lincoln proved to be highly intelligent and a voracious reader. He held various jobs as a young man, including working on a flatboat down the Mississippi River, splitting rails and logs, and as a store keeper. He moved to Illinois in 1830 and in 1832, he volunteered for military service during the Black Hawk War in Illinois. Elected captain of a militia company, Lincoln saw no combat, but credited his time leading men in the military as one of the most proud and instructional periods of his life.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P2'>After the Black Hawk War, Lincoln operated a general store in New Salem, Illinois. When the business began to lose money, he decided to study law and become an attorney. Unlike most other lawyers, who attended a law school or studied under established attorneys, Lincoln’s education was self-guided through legal texts and books he borrowed or purchased. Meanwhile, he developed an interest in politics. After an unsuccessful run for the Illinois legislature in 1833, he ran again in 1834 and won a seat in the state’s House of Representatives. He served one term and became known for his support of internal improvements and his Free Soil position on slavery, which opposed slavery in the new territories and criticized abolition (the immediate, forced end of slavery).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P3'>After leaving the Illinois legislature in 1836, Lincoln became a successful attorney in Springfield. He handled many different types of cases, and over the course of his legal career, representing poor individuals in criminal cases as well as large businesses, such as the Illinois Central Railroad. Lincoln argued 175 cases before the Illinois Supreme Court, serving as the single attorney in 51 of those cases (31 of which he won). As an attorney, he developed a reputation for integrity and earned the nickname “Honest Abe.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P4'>In 1846, Lincoln won an election as a member of the Whig Party to the U.S. House of Representatives for Illinois. As a freshman congressman, he helped author legislation to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but the bill died due to insufficient support. More notably, Lincoln opposed the Mexican-American War which erupted in 1846 due to a border dispute between the United States and Mexico. He criticized Democratic president James K. Polk, but this proved unpopular in his home state. He had promised to only serve one term in Congress and declined to run for reelection. He returned to Springfield after the expiration of his term in 1849 and resumed his law practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P5'>Lincoln’s political ambitions continued to grow in the 1850s. The volatile debate over the future of slavery in the territories, especially following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854—which overturned slavery restrictions established by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and opened all western territories to slavery through popular sovereignty (vote of the residents)—inspired Lincoln to speak publicly about his opposition to slavery. His chief rival became Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas, a powerful voice in the national Democratic Party, and the author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Lincoln gave numerous speeches denouncing slavery as a moral wrong and opposing its extension into the territories. However, like most northerners, he was not an abolitionist and did not advocate for the immediate end of slavery across the United States. Most white Americans during the 1850s embraced white supremacy, and many northerners did not want African Americans—as slaves or as free people—in their communities. Lincoln believed that southern states had the legal right to maintain the institution of slavery within their own borders, and he fended off accusations that he was for African American equality. For years he gave tacit support to a plan promoted among moderate politicians to send freed slaves to Africa.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P6'>The issue of slavery in the territories effectively broke apart the Whig Party and gave rise to the new Republican Party. Lincoln joined this new anti-slavery party and by 1858 received the party’s nomination in Illinois to challenge Douglas’s reelection to the U.S. Senate. Upon receiving the nomination, Lincoln gave one of his most famous speeches, declaring in part that “a house divided against itself cannot stand”—a reference to the United States being half slaveholding and half free—and predicting that the fight over slavery would either make the country give in to slaveholding interests or end the institution. During the 1858 Illinois campaign, Lincoln and Douglas engaged in eight public debates which have become the most famous political debates in United States history. Douglas championed his principle of “popular sovereignty,” allowing white residents of the territories to make their new states free or slaveholding, while Lincoln advanced a moral opposition to slavery in the territories as contrary to the principles of American freedom. Douglas ultimately won the Senate election, but the debates catapulted Lincoln to national fame and the leading voice for the growing anti-slavery movement in the north
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P7'>Only two years later, in 1860, the Republican Party nominated Lincoln for U.S. president. His chief rival was, again, Stephen Douglas. The election was the most contested and significant in American history. The Democratic Party split during its convention over the defense of slavery. Douglas and his outwardly neutral platform on slavery received the party’s formal nomination, but many southern delegates walked out to hold their convention, nominating John C. Breckenridge as the champion of pro-slavery interests. Talk of secession, which had circulated in years past, increased as southern politicians warned that election of Lincoln would be a direct assault upon their slaveholding interests and justify disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P8'>Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election without any southern support, not only placing the first truly anti-slavery president in the White House but proving that northern voters could elect a candidate against southern interests. Within weeks, states in the lower south began holding secession conventions to declare their separation from the Union. South Carolina led the way with its ordnance of secession passing on December 20, 1860. Mississippi was second, on January 9, 1861. In total, seven southern states declared secession even before Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P9'>Lincoln entered the presidency in the midst of this secession crisis. He rejected the legitimacy of the lower south’s separation from the Union. The matter erupted into open hostilities in April 1861, when Confederate forces attacked and overwhelmed federal troops at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. In response, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion, as he called it. Northern states responded enthusiastically, while several states in the upper south—including Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee—chose to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P10'>Lincoln’s objective at the start of the Civil War was restoration of the Union as it was. He resisted efforts by more radical anti-slavery northerners to attack slavery itself, and overruled Union general John C. Frémont’s effort to liberate slaves in Missouri in 1861. His actions were guided by concerns regarding his legal authority to challenge slavery where it already existed, and from fears that such steps would drive moderate Unionists in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland into the Confederacy. (Lincoln still personally opposed slavery and in 1862 signed an emancipation act liberating enslaved people in Washington, D.C., fulfilling a goal he had first undertaken as a congressman in the 1840s.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P11'>However, as Confederate military forces won multiple battlefield victories in 1861 and 1862, prolonging the conflict, Lincoln sought more desperate measures. For one, thousands of enslaved people had fled to Union lines, and more arriving daily. Secondly, the institution was the Confederacy’s greatest economic and labor interest. Millions of enslaved people grew crops that fed and funded the Confederate war effort, and southern officials used slave labor to construct forts and trenches that held back the Union armies. Recognizing that the Union could not defeat the Confederacy while protecting or leaving the institution of slavery untouched, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in secessionist areas permanently free. Although the proclamation was limited in scope (as it was a military measure that did not, nor could not, liberate enslaved people in areas not in rebellion against federal authority), it was a revolutionary act in American history. It formally changed the Union objective of the war, from preserving it as it was to “a new birth of freedom,” as Lincoln famously said in a speech in November 1863 at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Additionally, the proclamation authorized federal officers to protect the freedom of all enslaved people who fled to Union armies in Confederate territories and to liberate those they encountered during their campaigns in the south. Finally, the Emancipation Proclamation formally authorized the United States military to enlist African American soldiers. As a result around 180,000 black soldiers fought for the Union during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P12'>Throughout the Civil War, Lincoln struggled to lead the Union war effort in a challenging political and military environment. Democrats in the north vehemently opposed his administration and Republican Party policies, particularly those against slavery. Union generals in Virginia failed to defeat the Confederate army, lowering morale in the north and boosting prospects of southern success. Lincoln managed to handle these various challenges well, often accepting public criticism from generals and relieving them of command only when they failed to deliver military victories. He also stretched the authority of the presidency, authorizing the imprisonment of critics he believed directly harmed the war effort. While his administration was accused of violating the civil rights of some Americans, the Republican-led Congress frequently backed Lincoln and expanding his power.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P13'>In 1864, Lincoln feared he would lose reelection as the Civil War continued to drag on, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and millions of dollars. However, through battlefield successes by Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan in Virginia and Georgia, Lincoln won the election and support to continue the war until Confederate defeat. He also worked behind the scenes with Congress and various state leaders to legally end slavery through a constitutional amendment. While he voiced some support for the old plan of relocating freed slaves to Africa, by the end of the war Lincoln knew such plan was impractical and he supported protecting basic civil rights of African Americans within the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P14'>In the spring of 1865, the Confederate war effort began to collapse. Much of Lincoln’s attention was turned to reconstructing the former Confederate areas, some of which were already under federal control. He advocated for a speedy reunification, without malice or vengeance, and one in which former secessionists were welcomed back to the Union without slavery and with some recognitions of black civil rights. In April 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to General Grant in Virginia and Union forces chased down the last southern troops across the lower south. On April 14, as the Civil War was ending, Lincoln was shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. The mortally wounded president was carried to a boarding house across the street where he passed away the following morning. Lincoln’s murder ended most hopes for a peaceful reconstruction, as it inflamed tensions in the north and energized Radical Republicans who Lincoln had largely held in check.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P15'>Lincoln was married to Mary Todd, who was from a wealthy family in Kentucky. He had four sons, only one of whom (Robert) survived into adulthood. Lincoln is buried in a large tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P0'>The term cavalry referred to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of Civil War armies, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies typically used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P1'>Confederate cavalrymen enjoyed a reputation of superiority over their Union counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that Confederate cavalry soldiers often had to provide their own horses (something less common in the Union army) and therefore were more experienced and comfortable with their steeds. Two other theories are that Southern aristocratic culture placed higher value on horsemanship than northern communities, and that men who grew up in the South’s largely agricultural society were more familiar with horses than those from the industrial North. All of these explanations may have some merit, but exaggerate the differences between North and South, and cannot account for any great disparity in cavalry actions within the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P2'>More important reasons for Confederate cavalry’s positive reputation included some high-profile leaders and notable early war victories. J.E.B. Stuart’s battlefield success in the Eastern Theater during the first two years, coupled with his flamboyant style, made him and his horse soldiers celebrities in the South, while other cavalry commanders, like John Hunt Morgan, John Singleton Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, used aggressive and rapid cavalry raids to disrupt northern supply lines, defeat isolated federal troops, and generally tie up exponentially larger Union forces. Despite these early and famous Confederate successes, Union cavalry forces improved in quality and quantity during the course of the war, culminating in a fight to a draw at Brandy Station—the largest cavalry battle in North America—in June 1863. During the last two years of the war, Confederate cavalry did not enjoy its reputation of dominance, although it still managed to play a large role in scouting, raiding, and resisting Union forces.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P0'>A paramilitary organization is a group of armed individuals that act in a pseudo-military fashion, but is not an official military unit. Paramilitary groups are often associated with illegal or revolutionary actions, and frequently use guerilla warfare or even terrorism to achieve their objectives. The term paramilitary arose in the twentieth century, however examples of paramilitary-style groups during the Civil War include Missouri Bushwhackers and Kansas Jayhawkers, who engaged in guerilla warfare, and sometimes terrorist or criminal actions, ostensibly for their respective side. Some of these units were eventually accepted into formal military service within the Union and Confederate armies, while others operated with only tacit endorsement by the warring governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P1'>Paramilitary groups are more commonly associated to the Reconstruction era, when bands of armed citizens in the south organized to resist state and federal authorities who supported Republican policies. The most well-known examples include the Ku Klux Klan, the White League, and the Red Shirts. The Klan started as a fraternal order in 1865 among former Confederate soldiers in Tennessee but rapidly became a terrorist group, whose members often wore hoods to hide their identities. It became the most famous group dedicated to intimidating Republicans and African Americans in the south to maintain white supremacy. The White League was formed in the early 1870s in Louisiana, but spread openly across the south for the purpose of using violence to intimidate Republican officials and Black southerners who challenged white supremacy. The White League grew so strong as a paramilitary group that it mustered 5,000 members to outnumber and defeat the New Orleans police force and a state militia unit in a battle in New Orleans in 1873. The Red Shirts emerged around 1875 in Mississippi to oppose Republican Reconstruction and, likewise, enforce white supremacy over Black southerners, often through demonstrations at voting centers. These groups, and others in the south during the latter part of the nineteenth century, were organized, armed, and driven by political and social objectives, but were not formal military units or officially part of their state and local governments (even when they were supported by sympathetic officials).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P2'>White supremacist paramilitary groups reversed civil rights progress during the last years of Reconstruction and afterwards, and maintained a steady presence for many years, using intimidation and terrorism, to oppose efforts by white and Black southerners seeking racial equality.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD93419P0'>Vigilance committees were groups of citizens who acted in support of, or sometimes in lieu of, government officials to enforce law and order, or in the interests particular political and social interests. Some groups engaged in vigilante behavior, detaining and punishing offenders, or liberating and aiding others, outside of the traditional legal system. Vigilance committees existed in various parts of the United States during the nineteenth century. Before the Civil War, some extreme abolitionist groups formed vigilance committees in places like New York and Philadelphia to assist fugitive slaves escaping from the south. In the south, vigilance committees emerged in response to threats against slavery. These groups worked to locate and punish suspected abolitionists, or African Americans who secretly challenged white supremacist policies. In parts of the west, vigilance committees combated gangs or other illegal activities within certain communities. During the Civil War, vigilance committees in places like Mississippi organized for fear of slave rebellions or northern spies. Individuals within these groups would often report their findings to Mississippi authorities. After the war, various vigilance committees continued to operate in Mississippi as unofficial, or extra-legal, groups dedicated to resisting Black civil rights or Republican political interests. Some of these committees carried out lynchings or other public forms of punishment which served as warnings to other offenders. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
