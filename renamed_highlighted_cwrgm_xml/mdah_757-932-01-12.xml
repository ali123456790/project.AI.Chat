                    <p xml:id='OTPS76212P0'>LeRoy Pope Walker was the first Secretary of War for the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P1'>Born on February 7, 1817, near Huntsville, Alabama, Walker received a private education before attending the University of Alabama and then the University of Virginia in the 1830s. He studied law and became an attorney before turning 21 years old. Coming from an influential family in Alabama, Walker held various public offices in the state in the 1840s, including serving as a circuit court judge.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P2'>Walker was an outspoken advocate of secession during the 1850s. Following Alabama’s secession in early 1861, Confederate president Jefferson Davis appointed Walker as Secretary of War. He also served as a secession commissioner from Alabama to Tennessee, in an effort to draw the latter state into the Confederacy. Among his most notable actions as a Confederate cabinet member were public speeches in which he made bold—and very wrong—predictions about the fate of the Confederacy. Early in his tenure he rejected the prospect of large war between the Union and the Confederacy, famously claiming he would wipe up all the blood spilled with his handkerchief. After the firing on Fort Sumter and the sudden rush to war, Walker made another speech prophesizing a Confederate flag waving over the White House in Washington, D.C. By the late summer of 1861 he suffered health problems from work-related stress. President Davis offered him the opportunity to travel to Europe as a representative of the Confederate government, but Walker declined. He stepped down as secretary in September 1861, but accepted a commission as brigadier general in the Confederacy army and (despite no military experience) commanded troops at military forts and posts in Alabama. He resigned his commission in March 1862, but returned to the military in April 1864 to serve as a military judge.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P3'>Following the Civil War, Walker was active in opposing Republican Reconstruction in Alabama, including serving as president of the Alabama constitutional convention in 1875 that overturned Reconstruction policies. Following Reconstruction, he worked as an attorney in Alabama. He died on August 23, 1884. Walker was married twice, first to a Miss Hopkins who passed away after bearing him two children. He then married Eliza Dickson Pickett and had three more children. Walker is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P0'>A paramilitary organization is a group of armed individuals that act in a pseudo-military fashion, but is not an official military unit. Paramilitary groups are often associated with illegal or revolutionary actions, and frequently use guerilla warfare or even terrorism to achieve their objectives. The term paramilitary arose in the twentieth century, however examples of paramilitary-style groups during the Civil War include Missouri Bushwhackers and Kansas Jayhawkers, who engaged in guerilla warfare, and sometimes terrorist or criminal actions, ostensibly for their respective side. Some of these units were eventually accepted into formal military service within the Union and Confederate armies, while others operated with only tacit endorsement by the warring governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P1'>Paramilitary groups are more commonly associated to the Reconstruction era, when bands of armed citizens in the south organized to resist state and federal authorities who supported Republican policies. The most well-known examples include the Ku Klux Klan, the White League, and the Red Shirts. The Klan started as a fraternal order in 1865 among former Confederate soldiers in Tennessee but rapidly became a terrorist group, whose members often wore hoods to hide their identities. It became the most famous group dedicated to intimidating Republicans and African Americans in the south to maintain white supremacy. The White League was formed in the early 1870s in Louisiana, but spread openly across the south for the purpose of using violence to intimidate Republican officials and Black southerners who challenged white supremacy. The White League grew so strong as a paramilitary group that it mustered 5,000 members to outnumber and defeat the New Orleans police force and a state militia unit in a battle in New Orleans in 1873. The Red Shirts emerged around 1875 in Mississippi to oppose Republican Reconstruction and, likewise, enforce white supremacy over Black southerners, often through demonstrations at voting centers. These groups, and others in the south during the latter part of the nineteenth century, were organized, armed, and driven by political and social objectives, but were not formal military units or officially part of their state and local governments (even when they were supported by sympathetic officials).

<p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P2'>White supremacist paramilitary groups reversed civil rights progress during the last years of Reconstruction and afterwards, and maintained a steady presence for many years, using intimidation and terrorism, to oppose efforts by white and Black southerners seeking racial equality.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD93419P0'>Vigilance committees were groups of citizens who acted in support of, or sometimes in lieu of, government officials to enforce law and order, or in the interests particular political and social interests. Some groups engaged in vigilante behavior, detaining and punishing offenders, or liberating and aiding others, outside of the traditional legal system. Vigilance committees existed in various parts of the United States during the nineteenth century. Before the Civil War, some extreme abolitionist groups formed vigilance committees in places like New York and Philadelphia to assist fugitive slaves escaping from the south. In the south, vigilance committees emerged in response to threats against slavery. These groups worked to locate and punish suspected abolitionists, or African Americans who secretly challenged white supremacist policies. In parts of the west, vigilance committees combated gangs or other illegal activities within certain communities. During the Civil War, vigilance committees in places like Mississippi organized for fear of slave rebellions or northern spies. Individuals within these groups would often report their findings to Mississippi authorities. After the war, various vigilance committees continued to operate in Mississippi as unofficial, or extra-legal, groups dedicated to resisting Black civil rights or Republican political interests. Some of these committees carried out lynchings or other public forms of punishment which served as warnings to other offenders. (Wikipedia)
