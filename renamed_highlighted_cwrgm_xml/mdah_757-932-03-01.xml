                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69344P0'>Stemming from the first century CE, Christianity is the world's largest religion with over two billion adherents. Its largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. A large influence on American identity and thought since the nation's founding, Christianity (particularly protestant evangelicalism) spread rapidly in the first three decades of the nineteenth century in the United States due to a series of religious revivals known as the Second Great Awakening. Many Americans injected Christian beliefs and practices into many of the major social, political, and legal debates in the country, including debates over slavery (both pro and antislavery stances), education, and social reform. Christianity also became a prominent religion among the enslaved in the United States, who employed Christian rhetoric and belief in much of their social, religious, and cultural activities, and critical to enslaved people's agency and resistance.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69344P1'>American Christianity in the nineteenth century primarily emphasized both one's individual responsibility to God as well as collective responsibility for one's neighbors. Also deeply important to American Christians in the nineteenth century was millennialism, or the belief that Jesus Christ would establish a 1,000 year reign of peace on earth. These combined elements produced efforts at reform with the intent to perfect society in order to invoke that reign. Many of the enslaved, however, applied millennialism to the hope of slavery's abolition. Numerous politicians also incorporated Christian imagery and language to justify "Manifest Destiny," or the idea that the God of Christianity ordained that the United States' borders would extend from the eastern to western coasts of North America, while both the Confederate and United States governments applied Christian rhetoric to support their causes. Christianity existed and still exists in many different and often competing forms, yet the development of those forms came to define much of American culture in the nineteenth century and beyond (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 285-327; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 8; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.
