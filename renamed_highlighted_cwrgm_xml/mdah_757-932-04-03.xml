                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.
