                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS54863P0'>Andrew Monroe Hardin was a businessman and public official in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54863P1'>Born in 1819 in Kentucky, Hardin moved to Mississippi as a young man. He partnered with M. D. Haynes in a grocery and dry good store in Yazoo City in the early 1850s, and his business dealings helped him become a prominent resident in the state. Hardin was appointed the superintendent of Mississippi’s state penitentiary in the late 1850s and served in that role into the early 1860s. Following the Civil War, he returned to his business and retail interests, until becoming involved in the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, or more often known simply as the Grange, in the early 1870s. The organization emphasized agricultural development within communities. Hardin became a state agent for the Grange and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, around 1873. He remained there for several years, operating A. M. Hardin &amp; Company, which specialized in agricultural equipment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54863P2'>Hardin moved to Tennessee in the 1880s and passed away on May 2, 1891. He was married twice, first to Martha Wilson with whom he had at least one child. He later married Frances Burrus Edmunds. Hardin is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS75605P0'>Otho Robards Singleton was a Mississippi politician during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75605P1'>Born on October 14, 1814, near Nicholasville, Kentucky, graduated from St. Joseph College in Kentucky and then received a law degree from the University of Lexington. He moved to Mississippi and became a practicing attorney in 1838. Shortly after establishing his law practice, Singleton became involved in state politics. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1846 and then won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1848, serving until 1854.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75605P2'>Singleton’s political career continued to rise, and in 1854 he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. While he lost reelection after his first term, he regained a congressional seat in 1857 and served in the U.S. Congress until Mississippi declared its secession from the Union in January 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. Singleton resigned his seat and returned to Mississippi. He immediately ran for, and won, a seat in the Confederate Congress, serving through the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75605P3'>After the Civil War, Singleton did not hold notable public office until near the end of Reconstruction, winning a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives from Mississippi in 1875. He won reelection several times, serving until 1887. Singleton died two years later, on January 11, 1889. He was married twice, first to Martha Field, who passed away in 1856. His second wife was Eliza Yandell, who also preceded him in death. Singleton had at least five children. He is buried in Canton City Cemetery in Canton, Mississippi.

A member of our Company and Quar=master to it, <rs ref='#S55809'>James L. Meek</rs> will hand you this and receive any information you may have to impart. We have no tents and hope they will be furnished for one hundred and ten men the supposed strength of our Company. A few days ago materials to make tents were sent to our Company but no sample tent was furnished &amp; we could do nothing as no one knew how to cut them out. I wrote to Col <rs ref='#S54863'>Hardin</rs> to furnish us one, and he paid no attention to my request. The materials of course we will send back if ordered off before they are made.
