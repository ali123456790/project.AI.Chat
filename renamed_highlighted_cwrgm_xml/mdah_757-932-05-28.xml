                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS70568P0'>Earl Van Dorn was a Confederate general during the Civil War. He was born near Port Gibson, Mississippi, on September 17, 1820. His mother was the niece of Andrew Jackson, a connection that aided Van Dorn during his application to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1838. He graduated in 1842, but had received 163 demerits as a cadet due to actions such as failing to salute, using profanity, and using tobacco. Upon graduation, Van Dorn was appointed to the Seventh U.S. Infantry Regiment and served at various posts in the south, including Fort Pike in Louisiana, Fort Morgan in Alabama, and Pensacola in Florida.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P1'>Van Dorn married Caroline Godbold in 1843 and the couple had two children. However, Van Dorn developed a reputation as a womanizer, in part due to his famous good looks and charm. Additionally, he gained fame for military service during the Mexican-American War and later against Comanches in the west. These factors reportedly contributed to his popularity at social engagements, and especially among some women.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P2'>When the Civil War broke out in early 1861, Van Dorn resigned from the U.S. Army. He received an appointment as major general in the Mississippi militia, but shortly afterwards transferred to the Confederate army as a colonel. His first assignment was to raise a brigade of Texas troops and arrest any federal soldiers in that state. Upon reaching Galveston in mid-April 1861, Van Dorn led a group of secessionists to the harbor and captured three U.S. ships without a fight. The act prompted President Abraham Lincoln to brand Van Dorn a pirate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P3'>Fresh from his victory in Texas, Van Dorn was sent to Richmond, Virginia, for promotion. By September 1861, he received the rank of major general in the Confederate Army and in January 1862 he was sent to command the new Trans-Mississippi District. Upon taking command, Van Dorn faced a Union invasion of Arkansas. He led a campaign to defeat this threat and drive north into Missouri to capture St. Louis. The plan failed when his army lost a battle against Union troops at Pea Ridge, Arkansas, in March 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P4'>Van Dorn withdrew to Mississippi in mid-April 1862, after Confederate troops under Albert Sidney Johnston had suffered a defeat at Shiloh in southwestern Tennessee and evacuated Corinth, Mississippi. Van Dorn led an assault upon Corinth, determined to recapture it from federal troops. Although his attack began well, he had failed to study the Union positions at Corinth, and threw his Confederate troops against formidable fortifications. The assault failed and Van Dorn was relieved of command. He was given a smaller assignment, to lead Confederate cavalry under General John C. Pemberton.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P5'>Although he had not seen much success as an infantry commander, Van Dorn proved much more effective at the head of a cavalry force. He led a brilliant cavalry raid against Ulysses S. Grant’s supply depot at Holly Springs, Mississippi, in December 1862, spoiling the Union army’s first effort to reach Vicksburg, Mississippi. He continued to participate in Confederate cavalry raids and skirmishes against Union troops in Mississippi until his death in May 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P6'>Van Dorn was not killed in battle but at the hands of a jealous husband. In April 1863, Van Dorn had begun an affair with the young wife of a physician and state legislator, Dr. George B. Peters, in Spring Hill, Mississippi. Dr. Peters had caught his wife in the arms of Van Dorn on April 12. He nearly shot the general at that time, but Van Dorn managed to talk his way out of the situation. Then, three weeks later, on May 7, Dr. Peters went into Van Dorn’s headquarters, a stately mansion in Spring Hill, and shot the general in the back of the head while he worked at a desk. Dr. Peters was arrested for murder, but never brought to trial, as most southerners sympathized with his plight as an offended husband.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P7'>Van Dorn was initially buried in Alabama, but later moved to Wintergreen Cemetery in Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63158P0'>Samuel J. Gholson was a U.S. representative, U.S. district judge, and Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P1'>Born in Richmond, Kentucky, on May 19, 1808, Gholson spent much of his boyhood in Alabama. He began practicing law in Russellville, Alabama, in 1829 and shortly afterwards opened a law office in Athens, Mississippi. In 1835, he won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives. The following year, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi as a Democrat. He served until 1838, when his seat was declared vacant. In 1839, he received an appointment to a joint seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District and for the Southern District of Mississippi. Gholson served in that capacity until 1861, when Mississippi seceded. He had been a delegate to the state’s secession convention, following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory as president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P2'>Gholson volunteered for Confederate military service. Although enlisting as a private, due to his age and standing as a public official, he was quickly promoted, eventually rising to major general of Mississippi state troops in 1863. Gholson campaigned in the field during his military service, being present at the battles of Fort Donelson, Iuka, and Corinth in 1862. In 1864, he received a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate army and placed in command of cavalry troops. He was badly wounded in the arm and captured during the Battle of Egypt Station in December 1864. His injuries were so severe that Union officers reported him to be mortally wounded. In fact, Gholson survived the wound, but his arm had to be amputated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P3'>Gholson was released by Union forces in May 1865, after the war had ended. He immediately returned to state politics, winning a seat in the legislature that year. He served as the speaker of the house from 1865 to 1866, and then agitated against Republican Reconstruction over the next several years.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS76776P0'>Samuel Gibbs French was a northern-born general of the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P1'>Born near Mullica Hill, New Jersey, on November 28, 1818, French was raised in the north and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating from West Point in 1843, he was placed with the Third United States Artillery and served at posts in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. During the Mexican-American War, French performed well in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, and Monterrey, receiving the brevet (honorary) rank of first lieutenant for his actions. In February 1847, he was wounded during the Battle of Buena Vista, but remained on the field during the fighting. Following the battle, he received the brevet rank of captain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P2'>After recuperating in New Jersey from his wound, French was appointed assistant quartermaster in the general staff of the army. By 1849 he was able to resume field operations and carried out assignments in Texas and Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1853 he married Eliza Matilda Roberts of Mississippi. The couple had one daughter. Through his wife's family, French received a plantation near Greenville, Mississippi. In 1856, he resigned from the army to manage the property. The following year, Eliza passed away.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P3'>Following Mississippi’s secession in January 1861, French offered to support his adopted state and the Confederacy. He received a commission as a lieutenant colonel and chief of ordnance in the Army of Mississippi in February 1861. News of his support of the Confederacy reportedly sparked furor in New Jersey, leading to protestors ransacking French’s summer home in Woodbury and burning him in effigy. In October 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate Army and received an assignment to oversee the defense of the Potomac River in Virginia. For much of 1862 and 1863, French led efforts to create and improve defensive works in Virginia and North Carolina, including Fort Fisher (which was the among the Confederacy’s most elaborate defensive positions) and Petersburg (whose earthworks frustrated Union assaults for several months in 1864). French also led troops in the field, participating in fighting at Harrison’s Landing in July 1862 and Suffolk, Virginia, in September 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P4'>In 1863 French was transferred to the western theater, where he commanded a division under General Joseph E. Johnston during the unsuccessful effort to relieve Confederate troops besieged at Vicksburg, Mississippi. French continued to serve in the Mississippi area in late 1863 and early 1864, before being transferred to the Army of Tennessee in May 1864 to aid in the defense of Atlanta against William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army. He remained in the field, commanding a division during the Confederate advance into Tennessee in the fall of 1864. His soldiers took heavy casualties during the Confederate defeat at Franklin, Tennessee, and French was forced to take medical leave due to an eye infection that nearly left him blind. His last military assignment was the defense of Mobile, Alabama. He and his men held out until April 1865, when they surrendered to Union troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P5'>In 1865, French married Mary Fontaine Abercrombie. The couple had three kids and variously lived in Mississippi, New Jersey, Georgia, and Florida. When the United States entered the Spanish-American War in 1898, the 79-year old French—who had participated in thirty-five battles during the Mexican-American War and Civil War—reportedly volunteered for service. President William McKinley turned down his offer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P6'>French wrote a memoir entitled <hi rend='italic'>Two Wars: An Autobiography of Samuel G. French</hi>, which laid heavy criticism on several Confederate officials, including Mississippi governor John J. Pettus, General William J. Hardee, General John Bell Hood, and General Leonidas Polk. He also remained highly critical of the north, blaming the Civil War on anti-slavery northerners. French died on April 20, 1910, in Alabama while visiting one of his children. He is buried in Saint John’s Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
