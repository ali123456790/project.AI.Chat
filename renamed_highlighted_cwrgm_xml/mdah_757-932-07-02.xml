                    <p xml:id='OTPS74237P0'>Ethelbert Barksdale served in the Confederate States Congress from Mississippi during the Civil War and later represented Mississippi in the U.S. Congress after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P1'>Born on January 4, 1824, in Smyrna, Tennessee, Barksdale moved to Mississippi as a young man and began work as a journalist. He served as editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Yazoo City Democrat</hi> in the 1840s and in 1850 moved to Jackson to run the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippian</hi>, a Democratic Party newspaper. In 1860, he was selected to be a delegate to the Democratic Party’s national convention in Charleston, South Carolina. He proved to be a dominant voice for southern slaveholding interests at the convention, and when the Democratic Party leaders ultimately sided with northern Democrat Senator Stephen A. Douglas’ principle of popular sovereignty (the people of the territories could choose the fate of slavery), Barksdale walked out of the convention in protest with delegates from seven southern states. The Charleston convention nominated Douglas as the party’s national candidate for the 1860 presidential election, while the southern Democrats who split from the convention held their own meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, and nominated John C. Breckenridge to more strongly defend southern interests in slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P2'>Barksdale returned to Mississippi to rally support for Breckenridge, and he advocated secession as a response to northern anti-slavery actions. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president, Barksdale was among those calling for Mississippi to separate from the Union. He served as one of Mississippi’s representatives in the Confederate Congress during the entire Civil War. One of his final policy efforts was a last-ditch effort to allow African Americans serve as soldiers in the Confederate army. The matter was initially supported by a small number of military and political figures, desperate to raise troops to combat the Union’s manpower superiority. It saw heavy resistance, but finally passed in the final weeks of the war, though it was never implemented.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P3'>After the Civil War, Barksdale remained active in Democratic politics, serving as a delegate to party conventions in 1868, 1872, and 1880. From 1877 to 1879, he was chairman of the Democratic state executive committee. Then, in 1882, after Reconstruction had collapse, Barksdale won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served two terms, but lost reelection in 1886. Upon leaving Congress, Barksdale retired to Yazoo County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P4'>Barksdale died on February 17, 1893, at the age of 69. He was married to Alice Jane Harris and had three children. Ethelbert Barksdale was also the younger brother of William Barksdale, a U.S. congressman who became general in the Confederate army, killed at Gettysburg in 1863. Ethelbert Barksdale is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P0'>Unlike professional soldiers who may rotate through many units during the course of a military career, most Civil War soldiers were civilians who volunteered only for wartime service and expected to serve their military commitment in their original units. Since units were frequently raised among citizens of a local area, soldiers usually had great pride in their state and regimental affiliations and wanted to remain with their friends and relatives. Additionally, Union and Confederate armies did not normally send replacement soldiers to old regiments to fill the places of men lost from disease, battle, or desertion (Union and Confederate officials preferred to place new recruits in new regiments). Except for officers, who could receive a promotion and transfer to a new command, it was relatively rare for individual soldiers to transfer to a different unit during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P1'>Incidents in which soldiers did transfer into other existing units occurred due to special circumstances. Examples involved direct requests by individuals seeking membership in units with relatives or to leave a unit based upon discontent with the officers. Some requested transfer to a unit with a specialized assignment, or to switch from state guard service to national service or vice versa. In some cases, soldiers were transferred to other units for disciplinary purposes or because of variations in enlistment commitments. Both of these latter scenarios occurred with the 2nd Maine Infantry Regiment. More than sixty soldiers from the unit, who had volunteered for three months, became insubordinate when not allowed to return home after ninety days and were transferred to a New York regiment as a commutation of their original prison sentence. Then, when the 2nd Maine Infantry mustered out of service in June 1863, one hundred and twenty soldiers still owed one year of service, and were transferred to the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment to complete their commitment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P2'>Overall, individual transfer to a different unit was uncommon during the Civil War, and typically occurred on account of special circumstances or by special request. (National Park Service; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
