                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS75066P0'>Andrew Jackson was a general in the U.S. Army, U.S. Congressman, and the seventh President of the United States (1829-1837).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P1'>Born on March 15, 1767 in Lancaster County, South Carolina, Jackson was a member of the South Carolina militia during the American Revolutionary War, fighting against the British. After the war, he became a lawyer in September 1787. He moved to the western district of North Carolina, which became the state of Tennessee in 1796. Jackson settled in Nashville, where he worked as a lawyer and was appointed attorney general in 1791.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P2'>Jackson became involved in politics in the 1790s as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he was elected as one of Tennessee’s first U.S. Representatives in 1796. He also served as a U.S. senator for six months in 1797 and was a judge on the Tennessee Superior Court from 1798 to 1804. Afterwards, he became a successful planter and merchant and was the enslaver of at least three hundred enslaved men, women and children during his lifetime. He was also active in the domestic slave trade.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P3'>During the War of 1812, Jackson served as a brigadier general in the U.S. Army. He earned the nickname “Hickory” (later “Old Hickory”) for his formidable leadership during the war and for his success against the Red Sticks, a Creek Confederacy allied with the British. Jackson was also made a brevet major general. However, it was his victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans in December 1814 that catapulted him to national fame. For this victory, he was given a Congressional Gold Medal, which is the highest civilian award in the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P4'>Following the war, Jackson maintained his command but was allowed to make his headquarters at the Hermitage, his home in Tennessee. He was instrumental in forcing Native American tribes, including the Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and the Seminole to cede tens of millions of acres of land to the United States, especially following the First Seminole War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P5'>Due to the Panic of 1819, Congress reduced the size of the military, ending Jackson’s generalship. Afterwards, he served two months as the first territorial governor of Florida in 1821, and he became a U.S. Senator again in 1823. In the 1824, he was the Democratic-Republican Party’s Presidential nominee, and he won more electoral votes than any of the four candidates, although he did not win the majority. Under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment, the vote then went to the House of Representatives. In what Jackson’s supporters called the “corrupt bargain,” Henry Clay, who had been one of the candidates, threw his support behind John Quincy Adams, which culminated in Adams’s victory. Adams then appointed Clay as his Secretary of State.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P6'>Afterwards, Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee where he formed a new political party, the Democratic Party, vowing to crush Adams in the next election. Jackson depicted himself as a champion of the ordinary citizen and was nominated for the Presidency again in 1828. He won a sound victory with 58% of the popular vote and 68% of the electoral vote, and he won again in 1832, serving until 1837.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P7'>Highlights of Jackson’s Presidency include his Kitchen Cabinet, an unofficial group of advisors that Jackson turned to over his own cabinet, the spoils system, by which federal employees could be replaced by loyal Democrats, and the Bank War, within which Jackson challenged the national banking system. Jackson is also the only U.S. President to pay off the national debt in 1835. Jackson is also responsible for the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and for the systematic removal of Native American tribes in the east to territories west of the Mississippi river.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P8'>In 1832, John C. Calhoun and South Carolina threatened to “nullify” the Tariff of 1832 on the grounds that the union was a compact of individual states. This argument went so far as to suggest secession as a viable option. Jackson responded aggressively by sending troops to South Carolina and by passing the “Force Bill”, which authorized the military to enforce congressional laws. In effect, he rejected the “right” of secession and forced Calhoun to resign as his vice president. Jackson’s expansion of executive power throughout his presidency led to the birth of the Whig Party, and his opponents nicknamed him “King Andrew the First.” After his presidency, Jackson returned to his home in Nashville, where he remained active in politics. This included lobbying for the annexation of Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75066P9'>Jackson was married to Rachel (Donelson) Jackson, the divorcee of Captain Lewis Robards. Andrew and Rachel Jackson did not have any children, but they adopted Rachel’s nephews, including Andrew Jackson Jr. The couple also acted as guardians to other children, including three who were indigenous, Lyncoya, Theodore, and Charley. Rachel Jackson died in 1828 just before Jackson became president. Jackson died on June 8, 1845 in his home, the Hermitage in Davidson County, Tennessee. He was buried in the Jackson Family Cemetery at the Hermitage.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS72357P0'>Born around 1820 in Alabama, D. S. Pattison was a planter living in Claiborne County, Mississippi by 1850. During the Civil War, he served as a captain in the 2nd Mississippi Batallion (state militia). He was also the agent assigned to purchasing salt for the state of Mississippi. After the war, he resumed work as a farmer in on his plantation in Claiborne County, and in 1878, he shot and killed one of his tenants, a Black man by the name of Hamilton, for insolence. In 1882, he donated land to establish a town that was named Martin until 1912 when it was renamed Pattison after D. S. Pattison.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72357P1'>Pattison was married to Jane E. C. Pattison, who preceded him in death in 1874. The pair had at least two daughters. D. S. Pattison died on February 8, 1899.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
