                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS104714P0'>Henry Alexander Wise was a lawyer, Governor of Virginia, U.S. Representative, and Confederate Brigadier General.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P1'>Born on December 3, 1806 in Accomac, Virginia, Wise became a lawyer in 1828. Afterwards, he relocated to Nashville, Tennessee to practice law. For finanical reasons, however, he returned to his farm in Virginia (called Only) in 1830, where he was also an enslaver, including at least nineteen slaves by 1844. He became active in Virginia politics, and by 1833, Wise was elected as a Representative for Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won five sequential elections, serving until 1844. From 1844 to 1847, he served as the U.S. minister to Brazil under U.S. Presidents John Tyler and James K. Polk.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P2'>Upon his return to the U.S., Wise became active as a lawyer, and he engaged in Virginia politics again. In 1855, he was elected as the Thirty-third Virginian Governor, serving in the midst of escalating tensions over the issue of slavery. Wise's goal was to protect both slavery and the Union, but John Brown's 1859 attempt to ignite a slave revolt in Harper's Ferry, Virginia shifted Wise's stance. Wise was petitioned to commute Brown's execution sentence to life imprisonment on the grounds of insanity, but he moved forward with the execution order, leading some to talk of him as a potential presidential candidate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P3'>Wise's term as Governor ended in 1860, and he became a vocal pro-seccessionist, advocating for Virginia to secede long before President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops, which triggered Upper South states like Virginia to secede. Wise was a delegate at Virginia's Secession Convention of 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P4'>In 1860, Wise purchased the Rolleston plantation near Norfolk, Virginia, but he moved his family to Rocky Mount, Virginia in 1862, as U.S. forces took control of Norfolk. During the Civil War, despite his lack of military experience, he also served as a Brigadier General in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and was initially assigned to the western Virginia region. Following an officer's feud, Confederate President Jefferson Davis reassigned him to Roanoke Island and various areas of North Carolina and Virginia. His command of troops included the Kanawha Valley Campaign (1861), the defense of Petersburg (1864-1865) and the retreat to Appomattox Court House (April 1865). He surrendered at Appomattox.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P5'>After the war, Wise relocated to Richmond, Virginia and resumed his law practice. He was unable to reclaim Rolleston plantation because of his service in the Confederate army. Instead, Rolleston became a school for freedmen. However, Wise joined the Republican Party, celebrated the abolition of slavery, and was a vocal supporter of President Ulyssess S. Grant. He had two counties named after him: Wise County, Virginia and Wise County, Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P6'>Wise was married three times. His first wife was Anne (Jennings) Wise, who died along with one of their children in a fire in 1837. The pair had five children. His second wife was Sarah (Sergeant) Wise, who died due to complications from childbirth in 1850. The pair had at least five children, including an infant who died soon after its birth in 1850. Wise's third wife was Mary Elizabeth (Lyons) Wise, with whom he did not have any children. Wise had up to fourteen children, including four sons and three daughters who lived to adulthood. He died on September 12, 1876 in Richmond, Virginia and was buried in the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS70569P0'>John Anthony Quitman was an attorney, soldier, and politician from in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70569P1'>Born on September 1, 1798, in Rhinebeck, New York, Quitman graduated from Hartwick Seminary in 1816 and taught at Mount Airy College in Pennsylvania before studying law. He became a practice attorney in 1820 and moved to Chillicothe, Ohio, but stayed only one year before relocating to Natchez, Mississippi. Quitman’s legal career earned him enough money to buy a plantation in 1834. He eventually obtained three more plantations (one through his marriage to Eliza Turner), and enslaved over four hundred people, but hired white overseers to manage the properties and work of the enslaved laborers. As such, Quitman harbored a romanticized view of southern society and race relations, arguing that his enslaved workers were content and that slavery was the most beneficial system for society.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70569P2'>Quitman began his political career as part of the Mississippi militia, first serving as an inspector in the 1820s, and then by raising his own militia company in Natchez. He won election to the Mississippi legislature in 1826 and two years later became chancellor of the state. Over the next several years, Quitman participated in the Mississippi constitutional convention of 1832 and won election to the Mississippi Senate. He briefly served as acting governor of Mississippi and then, in 1838, was appointed to be a judge on the High Court of Errors and Appeals (the precursor to the Mississippi Supreme Court).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70569P3'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Quitman received a commission as brigadier general of volunteers. He initially commanded a brigade under General Zachary Taylor, but was then part of General. Winfield Scott’s expedition to Mexico City. He participated in the Siege of Veracruz and performed well enough to receive a promotion of major general in the Regular U.S. Army in 1847. He received command of the new Fourth Division, responsible for guarding supplies in the rear. Although frustrated with this assignment, Quitman eventually received orders to move to the front and he played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Chapultepec. When Mexico City fell to the U.S. Army, General Scott placed Quitman as military governor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70569P4'>Quitman returned to Mississippi from Mexico in 1848 to a hero’s welcome. He was elected governor of Mississippi in 1850. Shortly afterwards, he was approached by Narciso López, a Venezuaelan-born Spanish general, who offered him command of an expedition to liberate Cuba from Spain. Quitman rejected the proposal, but offered to aid in the procurement of men and supplies. When López’s campaign failed, Quitman was accused of violating the Neutrality Act of 1817, which made it illegal for any American to engage in war against a country at peace with the United States. He was forced to resign from the governor’s office to defend himself from the charges. Quitman barely escaped conviction after three juries failed to render a verdict.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70569P5'>Quitman’s experience with the López apparently did not quell his interest in liberating Cuba, as he accepted President Franklin Pierce’s suggestion to prepare a new military campaign to defeat the Spanish there. Many southerners saw Cuba as a potential new slaveholding state to join the United States. However, Pierce’s administration retracted its endorsement of the plan in 1854, after Quitman had already helped recruit several thousand volunteers, likely due to political turmoil within the Democratic Party in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70569P6'>With the Cuba expedition cancelled, Quitman turned back to politics and won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. He took office in 1855 and served until his death on July 17, 1858, possibly as a victim of “National Hotel disease.” The affliction was an illness that appeared in 1857 among as many as four hundred guests at the National Hotel in Washington, D.C. The exact pathology of the disease is not known, but was likely a form of dysentery. Quitman was one of roughly three dozen fatal victims of the mysterious illness. He is buried in Natchez City Cemetery in Natchez, Mississippi.

Several more appeared during the next few years, and by the time Mississippi entered the Union in 1817 at least half a dozen different publications had emerged. Over the following years, newspaper companies opened as communities grew and the demand for information increased. Publishing resources (like paper and print presses) became more available aiding in the news media boom. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Mississippi towns or counties had a local newspaper, published daily or weekly. Major cities typically had more than one newspaper, often published by competing political parties. Most newspapers went out of business after only a few years; however, a few continued in print for decades, including <hi rend='italic'>The Columbus Democrat</hi> in Columbus (1836–1877), <hi rend='italic'>The Kosciusko Chronicle</hi> in Kosciusko (1846–1892), and the <hi rend='italic'>Grenada Sentinel</hi> of Grenada which started in 1868 and remained in publication until 1955.

The first expedition began in 1849 when López recruited six-hundred volunteers made up of Cuban exiles from New York City and others and stationed them on Round Island in the Mississippi Sound. The expedition was not authorized by the United States government and fell apart when President Zachary Taylor ordered the Navy to seize Narciso’s transport ships at Round Island before they could leave for Cuba. The second expedition arrived in Cuba in May of 1850 and seized the town of Cárdenas, but made a hasty retreat to Key West, Florida when local support failed to materialize. The final expedition arrived in Cuba in August of 1851 but failed when it was overrun by Spanish forces. López was captured and executed along with some of his followers, with other prisoners sent to work in mining camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
