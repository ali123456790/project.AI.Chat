                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS85109P0'>William Joseph Hardee was a career military officer who helped shape U.S. Army infantry tactics during the nineteenth century and then served as a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P1'>Born on October 12, 1815, in Camden County, Georgia, Hardee graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1838. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Second U.S. Dragoons and saw service in Florida during the Seminole Wars. In 1840, Hardee received orders to travel to France to study military tactics, due to that country’s strong reputation for military professionalism dating back to the Napoleonic Era of the early nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P2'>Hardee was with the Second U.S. Dragoons in Texas in 1846 during the build-up of hostilities between the United States and Mexico. He was second-in-command of an 80-man detachment sent to scout Mexican military activity near Carricitos Ranch on April 25, 1846. The American scouting party ran into over 1,500 Mexican soldiers and were quickly overwhelmed in a brief skirmish. Hardee and most of the Americans were captured. They were released by the Mexican Army a few days later, but the incident was among the early incidents that sparked the Mexican-American War. Over the next two years, Hardee participated in several engagements, was wounded in a skirmish near La Rosia, Mexico, and received two brevet (honorary) promotions for his performance in battle.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P3'>After the Mexican-American War, Hardee briefly commanded units of the Texas Rangers before transferring to West Point in 1853 to teach tactics. In 1856, served as the school’s commandant of cadets. During this period, by request of Secretary of War (and future Confederate president) Jefferson Davis, Hardee authored the <hi rend='italic'>Rifle and Light Infantry Tactics for the Exercise and Manoeuvres of Troops When Acting as Light Infantry or Riflemen</hi> (or more commonly known as “Hardee’s Tactics”). The book was largely inspired by his time studying French tactics and became the most popular drill manual for infantry soldiers during the Civil War. Hardee also helped design or inspire a distinctive black felt hat adopted by members of the 1st and 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiments in the late 1850s. Known as the “Hardee hat,” the flat-topped and wide brimmed hat was never standard issue for soldiers, but was commonly seen during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P4'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Hardee resigned his U.S. Army commission and volunteered for Confederate service. He was initially made a colonel and placed in command of two forts near Mobile Bay in Alabama. However, he received a promotion to brigadier general in June 1861 and then a promotion to major general in October 1861. He became a corps commander under General Albert Sidney Johnston’s Army of Central Kentucky and participated in the Battle of Shiloh, where he was wounded in the arm. Following that battle, Hardee’s corps was transferred to General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Tennessee. He returned to the field and continued to be a competent and generally popular field officer, performing well at the Battle of Perryville in October 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P5'>In the fall of 1862, Hardee was promoted to lieutenant general. He played a conspicuous part in the Battle of Stones River (or Murfreesboro) in late December 1862 and early January 1863. He later clashed with Bragg (as did many other Confederate officers) and was transferred to the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, but returned to serve under Bragg at Chattanooga in late 1863. Hardee’s corps experienced a stinging defeat in the Battle of Missionary Ridge, when Union soldiers assaulted uphill and overran Confederate defenses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P6'>Fully opposed to Bragg’s command abilities, Hardee worked with other Confederate officers to convince President Jefferson Davis to relieve the unpopular army commander. When Bragg was finally removed from command, Hardee temporarily led the Army of Tennessee before General Joseph E. Johnston arrived to take charge. Hardee spent most of 1864 and 1865 handling different assignments across the south, such as opposing General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union campaign at Meridian, Mississippi, supporting the Confederate defense of Atlanta, and commanding the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. He continued to fight into North Carolina during the final weeks of the war and surrendered to Union troops after the Battle of Bentonville.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P7'>After the war, Hardee turned to civilian life. He moved to Alabama and eventually became president of the Selma and Meridian Railroad. He died on November 6, 1873, in Wytheville, Virginia. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Dummett, who died in 1853. He married Mary Lewis in 1864. Hardee had at least three children. He is buried in Live Oak Cemetery in Selma, Alabama.

It was reinstated as the capital from 1817 until 1820, when the capital was again replaced by Washington (which was later replaced by the current capital Jackson in 1822).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70573P0'>The Mexican War, also known as the Mexican-American War, was a military conflict from 1846 to 1848 between United States and Mexico over the border and territories west of Texas (California, in particular). Hostilities along the Mexican and American border had occurred years before the war, largely driven by American immigration into modern-day Texas, which had been Mexican territory. Texans had achieved their independence from Mexico in 1836, creating their own government, the Republic of Texas, which many Mexican officials still disputed. In 1844, James K. Polk won the presidential election on a platform to expand the U.S. westward to incorporate Texas and the territories of Oregon and California (the latter of which was controlled by Mexico). In 1845, the U.S. annexed Texas as a state, inflaming Mexican relations. Polk attempted to ease tensions by sending a delegation to Mexico to purchase land between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande River to settle a dispute over Texas’s southern border, as well as California territory. The Mexican government refused, prompting the Polk administration to send a small force of 80 U.S. soldiers into the disputed territory in Texas. Mexican forces attacked the American military contingent in April 1846, leading Polk to ask Congress to declare war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70573P1'>Over the next two years, the U.S. Army and Navy defeated the Mexican military in a series of engagements. American ground forces invaded central Mexico and captured Mexico City in September 1847 and defeated the last effective Mexican army in October of that year. Although U.S. troops won the conventional war, they continued to battle Mexican guerillas for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70573P2'>American diplomatic agents negotiated the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, ending the war and recognizing U.S. control of Texas, California, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Wyoming—slightly more than 50% of its territory. In return, the U.S. government paid Mexico $15 million for physical damages incurred during hostilities and assumed more than $3 million in debt Mexico had owed to U.S. citizens.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70573P3'>While the Mexican War proved to be a relatively short and easy military effort for the U.S. government, the accession of western territories created long term controversy within political circles. Debates over slaveholding versus free state representation in Congress had inflamed tensions for more than two decades, and the question over the expansion of slavery into the newly gained territories intensified arguments, contributing to the growing divide between northern and southern states.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
