                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94745P0'>Judah Philip Benjamin was a U.S senator from Louisiana and then a high ranking official in the Confederate government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P1'>Born to Jewish parents from London, England, on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, on August 6, 1811, Benjamin moved with his family as a child to Charleston, South Carolina. He briefly attended Yale College, but left before graduating, and moved to New Orleans where he studied law and became a practicing attorney. Benjamin entered politics in the 1840s, eventually being elected to the U.S. Senate for Louisiana in 1852. He was the first Jewish U.S. senator. He resigned his seat when Louisiana declared its secession from the Union in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, and returned to New Orleans. Soon afterwards, he received an appointment as attorney general of the Confederate government. President Jefferson Davis was so impressed with Benjamin’s abilities that he appointed him secretary of war in November 1861. Only five months later, Benjamin received another promotion, this time to secretary of state for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P2'>Benjamin served as secretary of state from March 1862 until the end of the war. He unsuccessfully labored to gain European recognition of the Confederacy, and during the final months of the war endorsed a last-ditch proposal to accept African Americans into Confederate military service. He fled the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, with Jefferson Davis in 1865, but separated from the group during their journey into the deep south to flee Union pursuers. Benjamin successfully escaped North American on a ship and sailed to Great Britain. He lived there for the rest of his life, successfully practicing law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P3'>Benjamin was married to Natalie Bauché de St. Martin, a French-speaking Catholic from Louisiana. The couple had one child before experiencing marital strife, and Natalie had moved with their daughter to Paris in the 1840s. Benjamin periodically visited his daughter, but his efforts to reconcile with Natalie were unsuccessful.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P4'>Benjamin retired in 1883, partly due to health problems. He died in Paris on May 6, 1884. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France.

Appointed by the President, the Attorney General led the Department of Justice and served in the Cabinet. Judah P. Benjamin initially led the department from February 21, 1861–September 17, 1861. It was later headed by Attorneys General Wade Keyes (September 17, 1861–November 21, 1861), Thomas Bragg (November 21, 1861–March 18, 1862), Thomas H. Watts (March 18, 1862–October 1, 1863), Wade Keyes (October 1, 1863–January 2, 1864), and George Davis (January 2, 1864–April 24, 1865) Operating at the national level of the Confederacy, the Department of Justice was responsible for prosecuting and conducting all suits in the Supreme Court in which the Confederate States was a party and advising the President and heads of departments in questions of law. It also exercised supervisory power over the accounts of the marshals, clerks, and officers of all the courts of the Confederate States.
