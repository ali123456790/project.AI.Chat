                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52212P0'>James Zachariah George was a Confederate officer and U.S. senator from Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P1'>Born in Monroe County, Georgia, on October 20, 1826, George moved to Mississippi as a child, first to Noxubee County and then to Carroll County. He volunteered for military service in 1846 for the Mexican-American War and served under the command of Colonel Jefferson Davis, who later was elected president of the Confederate States of America. George saw combat at the Battle of Monterey. Following the Mexican-American War, George returned to Mississippi and studied law. He was appointed a reporter of Mississippi’s Supreme Court in 1854 and spent two decades compiling a multi-volume collection of legal cases.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P2'>George was selected to be a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in January 1861. He was a slave owner and supported the state’s separation from the Union, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to president in November 1860. When the Civil War erupted in the spring of 1861, George volunteered for military service. He received a commission as captain over Company C, 20th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, but resigned in October 1862 when offered a commission as brigadier general in the Mississippi State Troops. He remained in the state service for one year before rejoining the Confederate army (reportedly due to frustration with the Mississippi militia’s poor organization and resources), taking the rank of colonel to command the 5th Mississippi Cavalry. George was captured by Union forces during the Civil War, and spent time in a prisoner of war camp.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P3'>After the Civil War, George practiced law in Mississippi and formed a very successful law firm with Wiley P. Harris. He was a vocal defendant of white supremacy during Reconstruction, and reportedly influenced Republican Governer Adelbert Ames to not arm African American militias in Mississippi during tensions over the 1875 election. Democrats used promises like this to weaken resistance to a campaign of violence and intimidation against African American and Republican voters. As a result, Democrats scored a major electoral victory in Mississippi, helping overturn federal Reconstruction policies designed to protect Black civil rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P4'>In 1879, George received an appointment to the Mississippi Supreme Court. However, he did not remain there long, since he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1880. He won reelection in 1886 and 1892. He was a vocal proponent for a Mississippi constitutional convention in 1890 to disenfranchise Black southerners, and successfully argued in its defense in front of the Senate and the Supreme Court. George was popular among conservative white Mississippians, in part because he crafted legal exceptions to Mississippi’s voting laws that protect poor whites while denying suffrage to African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P5'>George died in 1897 in Mississippi City, Mississippi. He had been married to Elizabeth B. Young. The couple had seven children between 1848 and 1862, five of whom survived to adulthood. George is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in North Carrollton, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.
