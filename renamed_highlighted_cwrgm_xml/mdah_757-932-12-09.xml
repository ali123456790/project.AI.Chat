                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58648P0'>A deaf person is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as a person who is "unable to hear, either completely or partly" (Cambridge Dictionary). As with many other disabilities, the treatment and education of the deaf took an increasingly institutional, state-sponsored approach throughout the nineteenth century. Early American deaf education sought primarily to teach deaf persons just enough to accomplish religious purposes like reading the Christian Bible. However, in 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what became the American School for the Deaf in Connecticut. At this school, the deaf were taught not only how to read and write, but how to communicate in French Sign Language (FSL), a precursor to modern American Sign Language (ASL). This approach was adopted by other schools that opened more frequently throughout the United States later in the nineteenth century. Their approaches generally focused on training deaf persons to become good national citizens, rather than just good Christians as had earlier schools. Schools for the deaf remained cut off from others, making attendance at them an isolating experience, yet the nineteenth century generally saw an improvement in the treatment and education of deaf persons. CWRGM adopts the people-first tag "Persons with disabilities--Deaf persons" to emphasize the personhood of those with deafness over their condition (Britannica).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99901P0'>A mute person is a person who has "an absence of speech while conserving or maintaining the ability to hear the speech of others" (Wikipedia). Muteness may or may not be a permanent condition, as it both develops and manifests in many different forms and for many different developmental, physiological, or psychological reasons. In the nineteenth century, muteness most often displayed itself among the deaf, and nineteenth-century Americans often equated the two conditions and treated and educated them in the same ways. As with most disabilities, deaf-mute and mute persons were sent to asylums or institutions specifically for their treatment and education. Though an isolating experience for many, this institutional response at both the private and state levels sparked improvement in the education of deaf-mute and mute persons. CWRGM adopts the people-first tag "People with disabilities--Mute persons" to emphasize the personhood of those with muteness over their condition (Britannica; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63948P0'>The term "enslavers"  includes any person (male and female) who enslaved one or more of the more than 12.5 million people sold into the United States' race-based system of human chattel slavery between the 16th and 19th centuries. Enslavers used terms like "master," "owner," or "slaveholder" to imply a natural hierarchy within slavery and/or to imply that certain members of society were more capable than others. CWRGM, along with many other historical and archival resources, instead adopts the term "enslaver" to underscore the active effort on the part of enslavers to create and perpetuate a system of bondage over equally capable human beings deserving of the same natural rights (National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
