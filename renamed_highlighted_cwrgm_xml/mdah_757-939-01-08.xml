                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS73602P0'>David Emanuel Twiggs was a U.S. Army officer in the early nineteenth century and a Confederate general during the first part of the Civil War. Born on February 14, 1790, in Richmond County, Georgia, Twiggs was the son of a general in the Georgia militia during the American Revolution, and pursued his own military career in the nineteenth century. He was commissioned as a captain during the War of 1812 and then spent the next three decades in a series of army assignments on the frontier, engaging in several military conflicts with Native Americans, including the Black Hawk War in Illinois and against the Seminoles in Florida. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Twiggs led a brigade at the Battle of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. Promoted to brigadier general in 1846, he commanded a division through several battles, including at Mexico City. He briefly served as military governor of Veracruz and received a brevet (honorary) promotion to major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73602P1'>Twiggs remained in the U.S. Army during the 1850s and was in command of the Department of Texas when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Sympathetic to southern secession, Twiggs met with Confederate officials and surrendered his command, which included twenty forts, posts, and arsenals in Texas, as well as more than two thousand sidearms and forty-four cannons. He claimed he had surrendered to avoid bloodshed, but his capitulation occurred without any shots fired and before the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter. Twiggs was dismissed from the U.S. Army for “treachery” in March 1861.  Two months later, he received a commission as major general in the Confederate States Army and was assigned command of the Department of Louisiana. Twiggs resigned soon after receiving the assignment, though, due to poor health and retired in October 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73602P2'>Twiggs died of pneumonia on July 15, 1862. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Hunter, who passed away in 1840, and then to Telitha Hunt. He had three children. Twiggs is buried in Twiggs Cemetery, Augusta, Georgia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)
