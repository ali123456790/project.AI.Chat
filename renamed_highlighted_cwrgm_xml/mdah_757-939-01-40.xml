                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32012689P0'>John B. Deason was an attorney, politician, and Confederate officer during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32012689P1'>Born on July 21, 1824, in Trigg County, Kentucky, Deason moved to Mississippi as a young man. He served as an officer during the Mexican American War, and returned to Mississippi where he practiced law and became an emerging public figure in Copiah County. Deason was a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in January 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. Like nearly all attendees, he voted in support of the state separating from the Union. He volunteered for military service, helped raise volunteers for the Mississippi state troops, and was eventually commissioned as a colonel in command of the Third Mississippi Infantry Regiment, a unit comprised of volunteers from Mississippi’s gulf coast area. He led the regiment in a coastal defense assignment, and engaged Union troops at Biloxi in April 1862. The Third Mississippi’s enlistments ended in May 1862, at which point it was reorganized and most of the soldiers reenlisted. However, Deason departed the regiment at that time.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32012689P2'>After the Civil War, Deason served as a chancellor and district attorney during most of the Reconstruction period. Around 1875, he moved to Brookhaven, where he held a variety of public positions, including mayor, postmaster, and represented Lincoln County in the Mississippi legislature. He died on March 29, 1900. Deason was married to Mary Ann Keller and had at least five children that lived to adulthood. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Brookhaven, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS55219P0'>M. D. Haynes was a public official in Mississippi before and during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55219P1'>An active member of the Democratic Party in the 1840s and 1850s, Haynes worked as an editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippian</hi>, a newspaper in Jackson, before seeking the office of State Treasurer in 1859. He won the position and served in that role through the Civil War. Haynes tried very hard to keep Mississippi’s finances in order through the war years, but faced significant hardships due to the strain of war and from Union army campaigns. He moved the treasury office from Jackson to Meridian in May 1863 to avoid Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman, and then to Mobile, Alabama, for fear of Union cavalry raids.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55219P2'>In late 1864, as the Confederacy was falling apart, an audit of Mississippi’s state funds discovered a substantial discrepancy, and officials accused Haynes of owing the state more than $93,000. Governor Charles Clark demanded Haynes’ resignation based upon assumptions that the treasurer had stolen or embezzled the money. On January 2, 1865, Haynes resigned from his position as State Treasurer and committed suicide the same day. Adding to this tragedy was news from a later examination that found Haynes was innocent of the charges. The money shortfall had been the fault of a previous treasurer. Long after his death, Mississippi officials occasionally referenced Haynes’ untimely death, positing that his well-known and frequent use of opium may have contributed to his suicide.

Fort Maurepas/Old Biloxi briefly became part of the newly created Mobile County on July 31, 1812 until December 17, 1812, when Jackson County was created. It was incorporated as a village in 1843. Fort Maurepas/Old Biloxi was renamed to Lynchburg in 1853 and again renamed to Ocean Springs around 1854. On September 9, 1892 Ocean Springs was incorporated as a city.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W.

The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.
