                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

It became the capital of French Louisiana in 1722 and continued as the capital when Louisiana achieved statehood on April 30, 1812. It became part of Orleans County (now extinct) on the same day. In 1849 it was replaced by Baton Rouge as the state capital, although it temporarily served as the capital again from 1865 until 1880. (Wikipedia; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD97087P0'>Established in 1861 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Cook &amp; Brother was a firearms manufacturing company started by Ferdinand Cook and Francis Cook. The brothers were originally from England and produced copies of the British Model 1853 Enfield rifle musket, a standard weapon among the British army and one of the most popular muskets used by the Confederacy. Besides manufacturing copies of the Enfield, Cook &amp; Brother converted civilian shotguns for military use (namely by adding a bayonet lug to allow the gun to mount an Enfield-pattern sword bayonet) and produced bayonets and knives. By April 1862, the firm had manufactured approximately 2,200 firearms, most of which were issued to the 22nd Alabama Infantry Regiment, the 21st Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and the 27th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. The converted shotguns were largely supplied to Louisiana militia units. In April 1862, the company received a contract from the Confederate government for 30,000 muskets. However, Union operations and the subsequent capture of New Orleans forced the firm to move their business to Selma, Alabama. They eventually relocated again to Athens, Georgia. Then, in 1864, the Cook brothers and several of the company’s employees were called up as part of a reserve military unit in response to William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union campaign in Georgia. Ferdinand Cook, serving as a major, was killed during fighting at Savannah. Confederate officials continued to use the Cook &amp; Brother armory until the end of the Civil War. Overall, the company likely produced around 7,000 firearms for the Confederacy.
