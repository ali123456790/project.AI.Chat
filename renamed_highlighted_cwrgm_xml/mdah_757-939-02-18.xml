                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P0'>Mississippi historically lagged behind most American states when it came to public education. Although some individuals, including territorial governor W. C. C. Claiborne in 1802, advocated for public education during its earliest territorial days, most officials within Mississippi territory did not endorse a broad system of public schools. The territorial legislature did establish Jefferson College, but made no effort to provide free education to Mississippi children. During the early nineteenth century, most Mississippi children received instruction at home. Some families pooled their resources or were able to direct town funds to pay for local schools, which became the earliest public schools in the state. In 1830, only thirteen percent of Mississippi children attended public schools. Families with more money sent their children to private schools, and the wealthiest often chose to send their children to secondary schools or universities in the north due to the quality of the programs there.

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P1'>Several small colleges emerged in Mississippi during the nineteenth century, including some women’s colleges. Some of these programs tailored the curriculum to courses seen as appropriate for females in society. This meant heavy emphasis on domestic interests and arts. However, a few of the women’s academies offered a more traditional university course load, including Whitworth College, whose president argued that women were as capable of handling the same intellectual and technical pursuits as men.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P2'>The Civil War substantially changed public education in Mississippi. The conflict interrupted most Mississippi schools and universities, but federal intervention in Mississippi political and social events after the war led to new emphasis in public schools. Northern Republicans and philanthropic volunteers in Mississippi sought to integrate former slaves into Mississippi society and opened free schools for children, regardless of race. The Mississippi constitution of 1868 directed that the state government provide a public school system funded by taxes for Mississippians between the ages of five and twenty-one. The Reconstruction legislature founded the black land-grant college in the country, Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P3'>The end of Reconstruction led to a downturn in public education across Mississippi. As conservative white southerners regained control of state politics, funding for African American education programs dwindled, and by the 1890s the state formally segregated schools. The Mississippi school system remained segregated well into the twentieth century. Educational support for white children was not a priority for state officials either, and Mississippi did not require school attendance for children until 1918, making it the last state in the United States to enact such law.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92428P0'>Established in 1854, the Summerville Female Seminary was a girls academy started by Zebulon C. Gathright at Summerville, Mississippi. He and his brother Thomas S. Gathright had first opened a female boarding school at Summerville in 1845 named Gathright College. That school had closed after a few years and the brothers began their new ventures—Zebulon with the Summerville Female Seminar and Thomas with a boys academy called the Summerville Institute. The two schools were located next to each other and were among the most well-respected educational programs in Mississippi before the Civil War. The Summerville Institute typically had between 52 and 59 boys enrolled while the Summerville Female Seminary enrollment numbered around 30 girls. The Summerville Female Seminary building burned in 1875. Although Thomas Gathright constructed a dormitory for the girls at the Summerville Institute, both the boys and girls programs apparently closed the following year.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63506P0'>Primary and secondary education in the nineteenth-century United States varied greatly by region and economic class. Prior to the Civil War and Reconstruction, the United States had no centralized educational system, relying primarily on state and even municipal authorities to ensure that students received an education. In rural areas, particularly in northeastern states prizing education as necessary to republican government, many local communities developed the earliest forms of public education known as "district schools" that taught boys and girls alike for free. In urban areas, public and private schools (also divided by religious denomination) often competed, with public schools serving lower-income students and private schools serving wealthy ones (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 1, 396).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63506P1'>After the American Revolution, girls and women were encouraged to attend schools and receive educations, yet their roles in so doing remained divided based on gender. Nineteenth century Americans viewed women's place in the home, and women's education was widely accepted as a way for them to pass that education on to their children. The nineteenth century therefore saw more opportunities for girls to become students, yet still in a discriminated way. Prior to the Civil War, most schools, though co-educational were either segregated or, in the South, completely prohibitive to African Americans. However, during Reconstruction, the Freedmen's Bureau established over 3,000 schools for African American children between 1865 and 1869 (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 1, 412). Even after the legalization of and widespread efforts at educating African Americans, education in the United States remained deeply segregated, with inferior funding and resources provided to African American schools - a system entrenched during the Jim Crow era of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Consequently, the United States, and particularly the South, was slow to adopt universal, state-sponsored primary and secondary education, and what did exist remained marred by deep divisions of race, class, and gender.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P0'>In the nineteenth century, across the United States, women’s opportunities were limited. The vestiges of an element of English common law called coverture ensured women did not have a legal identity. Their fathers covered them until they married, at which point they fell under the legal identity of their husbands. In practice, this meant that women did not legally own property and did not even control their own children. They could not own businesses and could not bring suit to court. Rather, they had to rely on a husband, father, or other male relative. The concept of “Republican Motherhood,” however, ensured that some education was necessary. This ideal, which emerged after the American Revolution, held that mothers were central to raising virtuous boys who would one day shape the Republic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P1'>In the North, the Second Great Awakening and the rise of the middle class expanded women’s opportunities further. Heavily centered around the family, the middle class celebrated not an authoritative father but a loving mother. Separate spheres ideology held that men and women occupied different elements of society. Men were responsible for the public sphere, including politics and work outside of the home. Women took care of the domestic sphere, pushing temperance, self-control, hard work, honesty, and frugality. They had considerable power within this space, including nurturing children. Embracing these domestic ideals also pushed northern women into the public domain through such crusades as temperance and moral reform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P2'>In the agrarian South, patriarchy reigned supreme, where a male patriarchal “master” headed a family of dependents – women, children, and enslaved people, when financially possible. Here, men were virtually the law within the household. This hierarchy – and the dependent role women maintained – played a crucial role in uniting the South in its defense of slavery, for all white men were essentially “masters.” Operating with very little personal freedom, elite white women in the South also played a central role in managing the plantation household, overseeing large staffs of enslaved men and women within the domestic sphere. This expectation included embracing the violence that was necessary to maintaining the institution of slavery. Completely dependent on a male patriarch, women working outside of the home were limited to the occupations of the domestic realm, including working as a seamstress or milliner, teaching, domestic service, and sex work. Significantly lower paid than their male counterparts, these limitations ensured that poor white women often carried the burden of poverty in the South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P3'>The institution of slavery ensured that Black women faced still more limited circumstances. As chattel, they were defined by their productive capacity – their ability to produce in the field, the enslaver’s household, or reproductively. Subject to violence, rape, and the inability to control even their own children, enslaved women found ways to carve out elements of independency. Although enslavers sometimes forced enslaved men and women to engage in marital unions with spouses of the enslaver’s choosing, Black women often selected their own husbands, resisting the fact that these unions were only rarely enshrined in law and were subordinate to an enslaver’s desires. As far as was possible, these marriages followed the gendered division of labor typical throughout the U.S., where women were responsible for cooking, cleaning, and caring for children. Within these private households and the slave quarters more generally, enslaved women also engaged in the religions and cultural practices of their ancestry, including Caribbean and African influences.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P4'>The Civil War expanded women’s roles in society. Still within the realm of the domestic sphere, women in both regions formed Ladies Military Aid Societies, with an eye towards supporting soldiers. These groups sent domestic necessities, including clothing, socks, and bandages, and they eventually embraced nursing. In the South, societies even began making cartridges and preparing sandbags. Such work and the broader need for women to maintain the household without a male counterpart ensured that women took on new responsibilities, many of which pushed them deeper into the public sphere than was possible before the war. In the South, poor women even became active in demanding that the Confederacy support their families, even rioting publicly in places like Richmond. As many Black women escaped to the U.S. Army during the war, marriage often became their first goal, even forcing the federal government to implement new policies that protected and supported their families. They seized this opportunity to rebuild the families that had long-been severed by the institution of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P5'>After the war, many of these expansions in women’s roles declined, but they did not disappear entirely. Northern women became active in providing support for veterans and their families, even helping navigating the pension system, while southern white women became active in burying the dead, memorialization, and the emergence of the Lost Cause mythology. This idea downplayed the role of slavery in the war and celebrated the Confederacy for its protection of families, within which, women were vital. Black women continued to lobby the U.S. government, including utilizing the Freedman’s Bureau to relocate members of their families and to solidify those unions. With intimate knowledge of the skills and length of individual tasks, they also played pivotal roles in negotiating the financial value of their labor and of negotiating the terms of free labor more generally. Nevertheless, the sexual victimization of Black women continued, becoming a prominent feature of the postwar South.
