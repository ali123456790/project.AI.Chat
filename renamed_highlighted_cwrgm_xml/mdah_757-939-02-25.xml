                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD104733P0'>South Carolina's Nullification Convention of 1832 signaled the culmination of tensions mounting for many years between northern manufacturing and southern agriculture. In 1828, the United States Congress passed a higher tariff on imported goods. This tariff angered many predominantly agricultural states. High tariffs aided American manufacturing by rendering their goods cheaper than foreign manufactures, yet it hurt American agricultural workers by discouraging foreign nations from buying their products, particularly southern cotton. In response, South Carolinian and Vice President of the United States John C. Calhoun published essays espousing the theory of nullification, claiming that individual states could "nullify" federal laws if they deemed them unconstitutional. The alternative to nullification, Calhoun argued, would necessarily be secession. After fierce debates in Congress over the issue, Kentucky senator Henry Clay passed a new tariff that lowered the former one, but not enough to assuage South Carolina's politicians. South Carolina's legislative election of 1832 placed many states' rights advocates in the legislature who then called for a convention to officially reject the new tax. The convention passed an Ordinance of Nullification on November 24, 1832 and threatened to secede from the United States should the U. S. government try to intervene. The U. S. Congress responded by passing a Force Bill and preparing the military to force South Carolina to align with the law., leading Calhoun to resign as Vice President. However, both parties avoided conflict due to less public negotiations that produced a truce. On March 2, 1833, Congress lowered the tariff and South Carolina rescinded its Ordinance of Nullification. This episode ultimately highlighted South Carolina's deepening commitment to enslaved labor and the agriculture produced by it, as well as its formation of and allegiance to states' rights ideology based on that commitment to slavery. The Nullification Crisis in these ways laid the foundation for South Carolina's secession from the U. S. in 1860 (South Carolina Historical Society).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD85422P0'>The cavalry units in Mississippi’s militia were mostly comprised of men from the upper classes and men who brought their horses and could afford the associated equipment. Like their infantry counterparts, men in the cavalry tended to be older, more established men who were outside the draft age and eager to serve the Confederacy, but desired to stay close to home to work their farms and care for their families. Mississippi’s militia structure was convoluted, and the cavalry was no exception. Official state units, home guard, informal local defense units, and the introduction of the Mississippi State Troops in 1862 blurred the definition of what the militia was. As the war continued, service in the militia in any of its forms did not guarantee a militiaman would stay close to home. Many units saw themselves transferred into Confederate service, such as Perrin’s Battalion Cavalry which became the 11th Regiment, Mississippi Cavalry and Davenport’s Battalion Cavalry which was merged into the 6th Regiment Mississippi Cavalry. Many units that were not transferred to the Army were sent from their local area to other parts of the state and placed under the command of Confederate officers. (Tracy L.

</p>

<p corresp='TTP1654570P3' xml:id='OTP1654570P3'>My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1654570P4' xml:id='OTP1654570P4'>It is now past 9 oc PM, and I have just had a letter from <rs ref='#S58699'>D<add place='above'>r</add></rs> <rs ref='#S70274'>F R Witter</rs>—<rs ref='#S69099'>Seacoast</rs>. Writing of other mat-ters he says he has just written you asking for a Commission to join a <rs ref='#S85422'>troop of mounted men</rs> for Sea Coast defence. I thought when reading that I might take the liberty to say a word in your ear.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1654570P5' xml:id='OTP1654570P5'>I first met with Witter in summer of 1834, we were on same vessel. He is a <rs ref='#S63094'>Carolinian</rs>, was in the <rs ref='#S104733'>Nullification war</rs> &amp; I think true to Carolina instincts would fight to the death, even if he were not naturally belligerant. We have corresponded before &amp; since on war terms &amp; so far as a pugnacious little old fellow can judge, he has been up to the mark. I am sure he has so much pride of char-acter that he would run trail a Missi flag. He is a man of  [?] and fair conversation of excellent medical skill, no bad re-commendation, he is I think industrious &amp; him full of energy.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1654570P6' xml:id='OTP1654570P6'>I know not his popularity, fear like too many of my brother Carolinians he cannot put on appearances to be popular. I have seen a good deal of Witter &amp; always saw the gentleman. He is hot headed and impulsive, but to me no small recommendation, for from <rs ref='#S97896'>Hagan</rs>, one of an hot [?] [?] said–impulsive man an honest—Witter has been trying to get his children fixed off for months so he coud <rs ref='#S25009156'>enlist</rs>, writing me so he must arm as high private. I really know no man who could act a sent better, in passing from point to point, &amp; where hard riding &amp; hard blows would be—he deceives me, if he would not <hi rend='underline'>be there</hi>.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1654570P7' xml:id='OTP1654570P7'>Please my dear Sir, pardon this [?] &amp; [?]  way of mine. I would not be impertinently familiar, yet your cause is my cause I feel all that I can &amp; I mourn my lack of bodily power on my own amount of zeal.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1654570P8' xml:id='OTP1654570P8'>Sincerely your admirer &amp; well wisher—
