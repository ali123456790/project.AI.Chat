                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25026190P0'>Henry Stuart Foote was a U.S. Senator and governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25026190P1'>Born on February 28, 1804, in Fauquier County, Virginia, Foote graduated from Washington College in Lexington, Virginia, and became a practicing attorney in 1822. He moved to Alabama in 1824, edited a Democratic newspaper, and helped establish LaGrange College (modern-day University of North Alabama). He moved to Mississippi a few years later and worked as a successful attorney in several towns, including Jackson, Natchez, and Vicksburg. Foote also traveled to the new state of Texas in the 1830s, and published a two-volumed book entitled <hi rend='italic'>Texas and the Texans</hi> in 1841.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25026190P2'>In the late 1840s, Foote won election to the United States Senate from Mississippi as a Democrat. He played a significant role in creating the Compromise of 1850, which tried to balance pro-slavery and anti-slavery political interests following the acquisition of new western territories after the Mexican-American War. The compromise was criticized by many fellow Democrats in Mississippi and led to talk of secession. One of those critics was Jefferson Davis, who was among the strongest pro-slavery voices in the south. When he ran for governor in 1851, anti-secession Democrats and Whigs united as the “Union Party” and nominated Foote to run against him. Foote won the gubernatorial election by a small margin and resigned from the Senate. He served as Mississippi’s governor from 1852 to 1854.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25026190P3'>Foote moved to California in 1854 and joined the American Party. He unsuccessfully vied for a seat in the Senate, but remained active in local politics. He returned to Mississippi in the late 1850s and then moved to Nashville, Tennessee. After the Civil War broke out in 1861, Foote won election to the First and Second Confederate Congresses. He was an outspoken critic many Confederate policies, and harshly condemned President Jefferson Davis and other officials. Near the end of the war, Foote attempted to depart the Confederacy for Washington, D.C. He was detained by southern officials and was nearly expelled from the Confederate Congress. He briefly served as a commissioner for Confederate prisoners of war held by the Union, before again trying to reach Washington, D.C. Successful in this second attempt, federal officials rejected his effort to meet with President Abraham Lincoln. Rather than return to the Confederacy, Foote fled to Canada and then to London.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25026190P4'>After the war, Foote eventually returned to Nashville, Tennessee. He joined the Republican Party, attended the 1876 Republican National Convention, and accepted an appointment by President Rutherford B. Hayes to be superintendent of the New Orleans Mint in the late 1870s. He died on May 19, 1880. Foote was married twice, first to Elizabeth Winters who passed away in 1855. He then married Rachel D. Boyd. Foote had seven children. He is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

</p>

<p corresp='TTP25118261P4' xml:id='OTP25118261P4'>While I am aware of the num-ber of importunate applications of this character which are constantly coming to your notice, yet, I beg to be permitted to claim for this a favorable con-sideration.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25118261P5' xml:id='OTP25118261P5'>The man, R. S. Perry was <rs ref='#S71046'>convicted</rs> at <rs ref='#S63000'>Holly Springs</rs> of <rs ref='#S63925'>watch stealing</rs> and con-victed under, what I am led to believe, partial evidence, to the Penitentiary for three years. The Term of his service expires in about Two months.

<p corresp='TTP25118261P6' xml:id='OTP25118261P6'>It appears from the letters I enclose to you, that a transcript or Bill of exceptions was prepared and transmitted &amp; delivered to the Executive of the State, (probably <rs ref='#S25026190'>your predecessor</rs>) that the crime

<p corresp='TTP25118262P1' xml:id='OTP25118262P1'>Even upon the charge of Petit Larceny the proff, it seems, was vague and un-satisfactory, but since a <rs ref='#S63440'>Jury</rs> of the country upon their [?] pronounced against him (the accused) we have no<del rend='overstrike'>t</del> right nor would it avail us to say that the verdict, in point of Law, was unjust &amp; [?].

<p corresp='TTP25118262P2' xml:id='OTP25118262P2'>The object now is to beseech Executive clem-ency in behalf of the convict whether justly or un-justly convicted, who has during his stay in the Prison of the State conducted himself in an unexceptionable manner, in such a manner, as to elicit the approv-al of his keepers, and which would go very far towards refuting any suggestion that he was a bad or dan-gerous man.

</p>

<p corresp='TTP25118262P4' xml:id='OTP25118262P4'>The accused has informed me that there was a large petition presented to the Executive of the state soliciting executive clemen-cy in Perrys behalf signed by a large number of the Citizens of Holly Springs and vicinity. Your Excellency may have seen this as will as the Bill of Exceptions. The means of the convict will not justify him in paying for another transcript.

<p corresp='TTP25118262P5' xml:id='OTP25118262P5'>Your Excellency will I trust excuse this trespass upon your time and the request for your Excellencys intervention, but the residue of the time of the man Perry is so short and the circumstances surround-ing his conviction so manifestly unsatisfactory that it would appear that Executive Clemency could be exer-cised without doing violence to any Rule which your Exc-ellency may have established with refference to the <rs ref='#S62927'>Pardoning power</rs>.

<p corresp='TTP25118262P6' xml:id='OTP25118262P6'>Perry is willing to take <rs ref='#S25009156'>upon his Arms</rs> if pardoned in defence of the rights of his section, if it should be deemed proper that one in his situation should be permitted to mingle with the soldiers composing our <rs ref='#S70882'>Armies</rs>, and suggests to me that he would exchange the Twenty Dollars to which he could be entitled on com-ing out of the Penitentiary, for a musket to be used in defence of the South.
