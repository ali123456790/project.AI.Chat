                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63404P0'>Thomas Overton Moore was governor of Louisiana during most of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P1'>Born on April 10, 1804, in Sampson County, North Carolina, Moore moved to Louisiana at the age of 25 to manage his uncle’s cotton plantation. He eventually purchased his own property and established a financially successful plantation. By the late 1840s he was involved in politics, winning a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1848 and the state’s Senate in 1856. He served as chairman of the state’s Education Committee and helped establish Louisiana State Seminary (modern-day Louisiana State University), with future Union general William Tecumseh Sherman as the school’s first superintendent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P2'>In 1859 Moore won election as Louisiana’s governor, taking office in January 1860. As governor, he spoke strongly against northern anti-slavery sentiments and vehemently opposed Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860. In January 1861, Moore ordered the state’s militia to seize U.S. military posts within the Louisiana, before state formally declared its secession from the Union. After Louisiana joined the Confederacy in March 1861, Moore called for Confederate support to defend New Orleans. As he feared, Union naval and ground forces advanced against the port city early in the war, securing in April 1862, and forcing the state’s government to move out of Baton Rouge for central Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P3'>Moore remained governor until 1864, most of his time in office seeing Union forces hold key parts of Louisiana. He returned to his plantation but was forced to leave when Union soldiers under General Nathaniel P. Banks raided his property during the Red River Campaign in the spring of 1864. Moore fled to Mexico and then Cuba rather than surrender to Union forces in 1865. From Havana, he applied to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon—the request being delivered by General William Tecumseh Sherman personally. Johnson pardoned Moore in 1867, and Moore returned to Louisiana. He regained his lost property, again aided by Sherman, but never returned to political office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P4'>Moore was married to Bethiah Johnston Leonard and had five children. He died on June 25, 1876, near Alexandria, Louisiana. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Pineville, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS77327P0'>William Mercer Green served as the first Episcopal bishop of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS77327P1'>Born on May 2, 1798, in Wilmington, North Carolina, Green graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1818 and became a deacon in the Episcopal church in 1821. He continued his religious studies and became an ordained priest in 1823. He spent two decades leading various churches in North Carolina before pursuing an advanced degree, receiving a Doctorate in Divinity from the University of Pennsylvania in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS77327P2'>In 1849, Green became the first bishop of the diocese of Mississippi and the 51st bishop of the Episcopal Church of the United States. Beyond growing the Episcopal Church in Mississippi over the next ten years, Green helped found the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. He continued his religious duties during the Civil War, but evacuated Jackson, Mississippi, when Union troops captured the city in 1863. When he returned to Jackson, he found his church had been destroyed.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS77327P3'>Green remained bishop in Mississippi until well after the war ended. He handed over some of his duties to a coadjutor bishop in 1882 due to poor health. He passed away on February 13, 1887. Green was married twice, first to Sarah Williams, with whom he had five children. She died in 1832. He then married Charlotte Fleming and had eight more children. Green in buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

It became part of the newly created Adams County on April 1, 1799. Washington served as the capital of the Territory of Mississippi from 1802 to 1817 and the capital of the State of Mississippi from 1817 until 1822, when it was replaced by Jackson. Presently, Washington is an unincorporated area that is not governed by a local municipal body. (Wikipedia; Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 932; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)
