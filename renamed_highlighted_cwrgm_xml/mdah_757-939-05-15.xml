                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS48994P0'>Gideon Johnson Pillow was a general in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War and later served as a general for the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P1'>Born June 8, 1806, in Williamson County, Tennessee, Pillow grew up in Tennessee and graduated from the University of Nashville in 1827. He entered the legal profession in Columbia, Tennessee, becoming partners with future-president James K. Polk. In the early 1830s, Pillow’s public standing increased as he received an appointment as a district attorney general in Tennessee and received a commission as a brigadier general in the Tennessee Militia. His future was further boosted by the election of his friend James K. Polk as U.S. president in 1844.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P2'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Polk appointed Pillow a brigadier general. He led troops in several battles, and was wounded at both Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. Pillow was promoted to major general in 1847, but soon ran into conflict with Major General Winfield Scott when the latter accused Pillow exaggerating his role at various engagements—a charge supported by the fact that Pillow likely wrote an anonymous letter to a New Orleans newspaper crediting himself with the American battle victories at Contreras and Churubusco. When Scott arrested Pillow for insubordination and violating military regulations, Pillow wrote to President Polk with accusations that Scott had tried to bribe Mexican leader Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to end the war. In response, Polk relieved Scott of command of U.S. forces in Mexico in February 1848. The matter was eventually settled with Pillow’s charges dropped and Scott reinstated as general-in-chief of the army, but critics of Pillow—including Scott—argued that he was self-serving and willing to lie for personal gain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P3'>Pillow returned to Tennessee after the Mexican-American War and became involved in politics during the 1850s. He attended the 1850 Nashville Convention, which was a meeting among southern leaders to discuss possible responses if the federal government prohibited slavery in territories won from Mexico in the recent war. Some delegates proposed secession, but Pillow and a majority of the other attendees opposed disunion and supported a compromise with the north. Pillow was active in Democratic politics, unsuccessfully vying to be a vice presidential candidate in 1852 and 1856, as well as a failed bid to secure a seat in the U.S. Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P4'>Pillow supported Tennessee when the state declared itself seceded from the Union at the outbreak of the Civil War. He received a commission as a major general in the state’s militia, and then in July 1861 received an appointment as brigadier general in the Confederate army. In September 1861, under orders from Major General Leonidas Polk, Pillow led Confederate troops into Kentucky as an effort to secure that state for the Confederacy. The move proved to be a monumental blunder, as the Kentucky government and many of its citizens saw the incursion as an assault upon their state’s neutrality, thereby securing Kentucky for the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P5'>Pillow gained some fame in the Confederacy following the Battle of Belmont in December 1861, when his force held off an attack by Ulysses S. Grant. He was then placed in command of Confederate troops at Fort Donelson in February 1862, where he led a successful attack to break out of the fort before Grant’s entire force could surround it. Despite achieving that initial objective, Pillow inexplicably withdrew his soldiers for resupply, allowing Union forces to close the gap. With defeat inevitable, Pillow passed command of the fort to a subordinate and escaped before the Confederates surrendered.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P6'>The events at Fort Donelson marred Pillow’s reputation, and he was briefly suspended from command by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. However, in December 1862, Pillow received another chance at command when he was placed in charge of a brigade within the Army of Tennessee under General Braxton Bragg. During the Battle of Murfreesboro, December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863, Pillow reportedly hid behind a tree while his brigade participated in an assault. Receiving criticism for his performance, Pillow was removed from field command and placed in charge of recruiting and conscription for the Army of Tennessee. During the final months of the war he served as Commissary General of Prisoners, before surrendering to Union forces in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P7'>Pillow, who had been one of the wealthiest landowners in Tennessee in 1860, was bankrupt after the war. He rebuilt some of his wealth with a successful law practice in Memphis with former Tennessee governor Isham G. Harris. He died of yellow fever on October 8, 1878, in Arkansas. Pillow had been married twice, first to Mary Martin (who died in 1869) and then to Mary Eliza Dickson (who was forty years his junior). Pillow had eleven children with his first wife and three with his second wife. Pillow is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS85109P0'>William Joseph Hardee was a career military officer who helped shape U.S. Army infantry tactics during the nineteenth century and then served as a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P1'>Born on October 12, 1815, in Camden County, Georgia, Hardee graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1838. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Second U.S. Dragoons and saw service in Florida during the Seminole Wars. In 1840, Hardee received orders to travel to France to study military tactics, due to that country’s strong reputation for military professionalism dating back to the Napoleonic Era of the early nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P2'>Hardee was with the Second U.S. Dragoons in Texas in 1846 during the build-up of hostilities between the United States and Mexico. He was second-in-command of an 80-man detachment sent to scout Mexican military activity near Carricitos Ranch on April 25, 1846. The American scouting party ran into over 1,500 Mexican soldiers and were quickly overwhelmed in a brief skirmish. Hardee and most of the Americans were captured. They were released by the Mexican Army a few days later, but the incident was among the early incidents that sparked the Mexican-American War. Over the next two years, Hardee participated in several engagements, was wounded in a skirmish near La Rosia, Mexico, and received two brevet (honorary) promotions for his performance in battle.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P3'>After the Mexican-American War, Hardee briefly commanded units of the Texas Rangers before transferring to West Point in 1853 to teach tactics. In 1856, served as the school’s commandant of cadets. During this period, by request of Secretary of War (and future Confederate president) Jefferson Davis, Hardee authored the <hi rend='italic'>Rifle and Light Infantry Tactics for the Exercise and Manoeuvres of Troops When Acting as Light Infantry or Riflemen</hi> (or more commonly known as “Hardee’s Tactics”). The book was largely inspired by his time studying French tactics and became the most popular drill manual for infantry soldiers during the Civil War. Hardee also helped design or inspire a distinctive black felt hat adopted by members of the 1st and 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiments in the late 1850s. Known as the “Hardee hat,” the flat-topped and wide brimmed hat was never standard issue for soldiers, but was commonly seen during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P4'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Hardee resigned his U.S. Army commission and volunteered for Confederate service. He was initially made a colonel and placed in command of two forts near Mobile Bay in Alabama. However, he received a promotion to brigadier general in June 1861 and then a promotion to major general in October 1861. He became a corps commander under General Albert Sidney Johnston’s Army of Central Kentucky and participated in the Battle of Shiloh, where he was wounded in the arm. Following that battle, Hardee’s corps was transferred to General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Tennessee. He returned to the field and continued to be a competent and generally popular field officer, performing well at the Battle of Perryville in October 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P5'>In the fall of 1862, Hardee was promoted to lieutenant general. He played a conspicuous part in the Battle of Stones River (or Murfreesboro) in late December 1862 and early January 1863. He later clashed with Bragg (as did many other Confederate officers) and was transferred to the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, but returned to serve under Bragg at Chattanooga in late 1863. Hardee’s corps experienced a stinging defeat in the Battle of Missionary Ridge, when Union soldiers assaulted uphill and overran Confederate defenses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P6'>Fully opposed to Bragg’s command abilities, Hardee worked with other Confederate officers to convince President Jefferson Davis to relieve the unpopular army commander. When Bragg was finally removed from command, Hardee temporarily led the Army of Tennessee before General Joseph E. Johnston arrived to take charge. Hardee spent most of 1864 and 1865 handling different assignments across the south, such as opposing General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union campaign at Meridian, Mississippi, supporting the Confederate defense of Atlanta, and commanding the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. He continued to fight into North Carolina during the final weeks of the war and surrendered to Union troops after the Battle of Bentonville.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P7'>After the war, Hardee turned to civilian life. He moved to Alabama and eventually became president of the Selma and Meridian Railroad. He died on November 6, 1873, in Wytheville, Virginia. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Dummett, who died in 1853. He married Mary Lewis in 1864. Hardee had at least three children. He is buried in Live Oak Cemetery in Selma, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63183P0'>Benjamin McCulloch was a general in the Texas militia, a U.S. marshal, and a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P1'>Born on November 11, 1811, in Rutherford County, Tennessee, McCulloch moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1834 to explore the west. After a failed efforts to travel to Santa Fe and in to be a lead miner in Wisconsin, he returned to Tennessee and became a farmer. Only months later, in 1836, he joined Davy Crockett’s expedition to Texas. However, McCulloch fell ill with measles and was unable to make the trip to San Antonio, and thus missed being at the Alamo when it was overrun by Mexican forces, leading to the deaths of all military age men defending it (including Crockett).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P2'>McCulloch joined Sam Houston’s Texas army and participated in the Battle of San Jacinto and received a battlefield commission to first lieutenant. In 1838, he became a land surveyor for the new Republic of Texas and joined the Texas Rangers. He gained additional combat experience during engagements with Native Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P3'>In 1839, McCulloch was elected to the Republic of Texas’s House of Representatives. His entrance into politics led to tensions with Colonel Reuben Ross, who had run against him for the congressional seat. The two fought a duel in 1840, which led to McCulloch sustaining a severe wound to his right arm. The next year, McCulloch’s brother, Henry, shot and killed Ross during a pistol duel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P4'>McCulloch returned to land surveying and military operations in 1842. He played a prominent role in an engagement against a Mexican incursion into Texas that year, and barely escaped capture during a failed attempt by Texans to raid into Mexico in an effort known as the Mier (or Somervell) expedition.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P5'>When Texas entered the Union, McCulloch was elected to the state’s first legislature in 1845. The next year, he was appointed major general in command of all Texas state troops west of the Colorado River. When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, he commanded a company of Rangers that became the lead scouting unit under General Zachary Taylor’s army. He became famous for his daring raids into Mexican lines and participated in the Battle of Monterrey and the Battle of Buena Vista.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P6'>After the Mexican-American War, McCulloch briefly lived in California, hoping to become rich in the gold rush that sparked in 1848. That endeavor did not pay off, but he did serve as sheriff of Sacramento before returning to Texas by the early 1850s. In 1852, he received an appointment as U.S. marshal for the Eastern District of Texas. He held that position through most of the 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P7'>When Texas declared its secession from the Union on February 1, 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, McCulloch volunteered for Confederate service and received a commission as colonel. He led Texas militia troops to confront U.S. Army installations in Texas, and captured all federal property in San Antonio on February 16. Three months later, he was promoted to brigadier general and received command of Confederate forces in Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma). He participated in the Confederate victory at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek in Missouri in August 1861. However, he clashed with Confederate general Sterling Price of Missouri, leading to Major General Earl Van Dorn taking command over both men.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P8'>On March 7, 1862, McCulloch commanded the Confederate right wing at the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas. His soldiers successfully captured a Union artillery battery that morning, but the federal troops rallied and held up the Confederate advance. McCulloch personally rode forward to observe the enemy positions. A Union rifleman (possibly Peter Pelican of the Thirty-sixth Illinois Infantry Regiment) spotted the Confederate officer on horseback and fired.  The shot instantly killed McCulloch. His body lay between the Confederate and Union lines, and his second-in-command, Brigadier General James M. McIntosh, was killed leading a cavalry charge to retrieve it. The loss of McCulloch and McIntosh disorganized much of the Confederate line, allowing Union forces to turn the tide of battle and defeat the Confederates at Pea Ridge.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P9'>McCulloch’s remains were initially buried on the battlefield of Pea Ridge. He was later moved to Little Rock and then to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS85111P0'>Claiborne Fox Jackson was a businessman and politician who served as a Representative and Senator for the state of Missouri before serving as Governor for the State in 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85111P1'>Born on April 4, 1806 in Fleming County, Kentucky, Jackson relocated to Franklin, Missouri in 1826, where he became a partner in his brothers' mercantile business. Jackson acted as the captain of the Howard County Volunteers during the Black Hawk War in 1832. After the war, he opened his own mercantile business before ultimately assisting his father-in-law Dr. John Sappington's business. Sappington was a prominent physician who found success in manufacturing and marketing quinine pills for the treatment of malaria.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85111P2'>During this time, Jackson also began his political career as a Democrat in the Missouri House of Representatives (1836). After serving one term, Jackson entered private banking in Fayette, Missouri but returned to the House in 1842, where he served until 1848, including terms as Speaker of the House in 1844 and 1846. In 1848, Jackson was elected into the state Senate. In the 1850s, he served as chairman of the State Democratic Central Committee and as Missouri's first state bank commissioner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85111P3'>On January 3, 1861, Jackson took office as Governor of Missouri, but he was staunchly pro-secession. Operating behind the scenes, he attempted to orchestrate Missouri's secession from the state, and he refused President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops. After putting into motion the plans for a military coup, Jackson was removed from office by the provisional Missouri government, although he continued to lobby for Missouri's secession. By November 1861, the Confederate government recognized Missouri as a Confederate state with Jackson as the state Governor, but the state was securely in U.S. hands, forcing this Confederate Missouri government into exile. Although Jackson's government planned to retake the state, these plans did not come to fruition.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85111P4'>Jackson died in Little Rock, Arkansas on December 6, 1862. He was initially denied burial in Missouri and was buried in the Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock. When the war ended, he was moved to the Sappington Cemetery in Arrow Rock Township, Saline County, Missouri. Jackson was married three times. His first wives Jane Breathitt (Sappington) Jackson (died in 1831) and Louisa Catherine (Sappington) Jackson (died in 1833) preceded him in death. His third wife Elizabeth "Eliza" Whitsett (Sappington) Jackson outlived him. The three women were sisters. Claiborne Fox Jackson had at least four children, including two girls and two boys.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P0'>The term cavalry referred to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of Civil War armies, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies typically used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P1'>Confederate cavalrymen enjoyed a reputation of superiority over their Union counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that Confederate cavalry soldiers often had to provide their own horses (something less common in the Union army) and therefore were more experienced and comfortable with their steeds. Two other theories are that Southern aristocratic culture placed higher value on horsemanship than northern communities, and that men who grew up in the South’s largely agricultural society were more familiar with horses than those from the industrial North. All of these explanations may have some merit, but exaggerate the differences between North and South, and cannot account for any great disparity in cavalry actions within the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P2'>More important reasons for Confederate cavalry’s positive reputation included some high-profile leaders and notable early war victories. J.E.B. Stuart’s battlefield success in the Eastern Theater during the first two years, coupled with his flamboyant style, made him and his horse soldiers celebrities in the South, while other cavalry commanders, like John Hunt Morgan, John Singleton Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, used aggressive and rapid cavalry raids to disrupt northern supply lines, defeat isolated federal troops, and generally tie up exponentially larger Union forces. Despite these early and famous Confederate successes, Union cavalry forces improved in quality and quantity during the course of the war, culminating in a fight to a draw at Brandy Station—the largest cavalry battle in North America—in June 1863. During the last two years of the war, Confederate cavalry did not enjoy its reputation of dominance, although it still managed to play a large role in scouting, raiding, and resisting Union forces.
