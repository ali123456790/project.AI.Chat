                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94255P0'>Benjamin Franklin Cheatham was a planter, Confederate Major General, and gold miner. Cheatham was born on October 20, 1820, in Nashville, Tennessee. He served during the Mexican-American War, ending the war with a rank of colonel. In 1849, he relocated to California, joining the Gold Rush as a gold miner, but he returned to Tennessee in 1853 as a planter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94255P1'>During the Civil War, Cheatham was given the rank of Brigadier General in the Army of Tennesee when he enlisted in May 1861 but was promoted to Major General in March 1862. He served during the entire war and was regarded as one of the Confederacy's most successful commanders. His service included the Battles of Shiloh (April 1862), Chickamauga (September 1863), the Atlanta Campaign (summer 1864), and the Franklin-Nashville Campaign (September-December 1864). During this last campaign, Cheatham hit the lowest point of career when he allowed U.S. Major General John M. Schofield to slip past him, leading to the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Franklin (November 30, 1864). Cheatham surrendered in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94255P2'>After the war, Cheatham returned to Nashville, where he served as superintendant of prisons and as postmaster of the city (1885 to 1886). Cheatham was married to Anna Belle (Robertson) Cheatham. The pair had five children, including three boys and two girls. Benjamin Franklin Cheatham died on September 4, 1886 in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee. He is buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32123713P0'>At the start of the American Civil War, military authorities in the Union and Confederacy activated old militia companies, or created new volunteer companies, throughout their respective states. Some companies remained as home guard units under state government authority, while many others were activated for national service and combined with other companies into regiments, which were the standard independent military unit on the Civil War battlefield. Comprised of ten companies, each with one hundred men, a full-strength regiment consisted of one thousand soldiers. Because most regiments were raised at the state level, they typically carried the name of their state as well as a number (that generally indicated their sequence of organization), such as the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123713P1'>While the early-war command structure varied, eventually Union and Confederate armies used a system that placed two or more regiments into a brigade. Two or more brigades made a division. Above that, two or more divisions would be placed into a corps, and two or more corps would make up an army. Because of the size and scope of the Civil War, the Union and Confederacy had multiple armies, spread across different states or military theaters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123713P2'>When activated for national service, state regiments had little control over where they were sent. Many units, especially from the Deep South—far from the initial war front—found themselves transferred far from their home areas and away from other units from their state. For instance, the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment and the 11th Mississippi Infantry Regiment were both organized in the spring of 1861 from volunteers around Corinth, Mississippi. The 9th Mississippi was first sent to Florida, then transferred to Tennessee, while the 11th Mississippi was ordered to Virginia upon activation for Confederate service. Regiments, and sometimes brigades or divisions, could see multiple transfers to fill gaps in other armies, or to create new commands as Union and Confederate armies enlarged. Subsequent transfers of units to new commands were more common in the western theaters, where fighting took place over a larger geographical area, forcing military authorities to more frequently divide or detach their available forces.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
