                    <p xml:id='OTPS85111P0'>Claiborne Fox Jackson was a businessman and politician who served as a Representative and Senator for the state of Missouri before serving as Governor for the State in 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85111P1'>Born on April 4, 1806 in Fleming County, Kentucky, Jackson relocated to Franklin, Missouri in 1826, where he became a partner in his brothers' mercantile business. Jackson acted as the captain of the Howard County Volunteers during the Black Hawk War in 1832. After the war, he opened his own mercantile business before ultimately assisting his father-in-law Dr. John Sappington's business. Sappington was a prominent physician who found success in manufacturing and marketing quinine pills for the treatment of malaria.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85111P2'>During this time, Jackson also began his political career as a Democrat in the Missouri House of Representatives (1836). After serving one term, Jackson entered private banking in Fayette, Missouri but returned to the House in 1842, where he served until 1848, including terms as Speaker of the House in 1844 and 1846. In 1848, Jackson was elected into the state Senate. In the 1850s, he served as chairman of the State Democratic Central Committee and as Missouri's first state bank commissioner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85111P3'>On January 3, 1861, Jackson took office as Governor of Missouri, but he was staunchly pro-secession. Operating behind the scenes, he attempted to orchestrate Missouri's secession from the state, and he refused President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops. After putting into motion the plans for a military coup, Jackson was removed from office by the provisional Missouri government, although he continued to lobby for Missouri's secession. By November 1861, the Confederate government recognized Missouri as a Confederate state with Jackson as the state Governor, but the state was securely in U.S. hands, forcing this Confederate Missouri government into exile. Although Jackson's government planned to retake the state, these plans did not come to fruition.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85111P4'>Jackson died in Little Rock, Arkansas on December 6, 1862. He was initially denied burial in Missouri and was buried in the Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock. When the war ended, he was moved to the Sappington Cemetery in Arrow Rock Township, Saline County, Missouri. Jackson was married three times. His first wives Jane Breathitt (Sappington) Jackson (died in 1831) and Louisa Catherine (Sappington) Jackson (died in 1833) preceded him in death. His third wife Elizabeth "Eliza" Whitsett (Sappington) Jackson outlived him. The three women were sisters. Claiborne Fox Jackson had at least four children, including two girls and two boys.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63183P0'>Benjamin McCulloch was a general in the Texas militia, a U.S. marshal, and a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P1'>Born on November 11, 1811, in Rutherford County, Tennessee, McCulloch moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1834 to explore the west. After a failed efforts to travel to Santa Fe and in to be a lead miner in Wisconsin, he returned to Tennessee and became a farmer. Only months later, in 1836, he joined Davy Crockett’s expedition to Texas. However, McCulloch fell ill with measles and was unable to make the trip to San Antonio, and thus missed being at the Alamo when it was overrun by Mexican forces, leading to the deaths of all military age men defending it (including Crockett).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P2'>McCulloch joined Sam Houston’s Texas army and participated in the Battle of San Jacinto and received a battlefield commission to first lieutenant. In 1838, he became a land surveyor for the new Republic of Texas and joined the Texas Rangers. He gained additional combat experience during engagements with Native Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P3'>In 1839, McCulloch was elected to the Republic of Texas’s House of Representatives. His entrance into politics led to tensions with Colonel Reuben Ross, who had run against him for the congressional seat. The two fought a duel in 1840, which led to McCulloch sustaining a severe wound to his right arm. The next year, McCulloch’s brother, Henry, shot and killed Ross during a pistol duel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P4'>McCulloch returned to land surveying and military operations in 1842. He played a prominent role in an engagement against a Mexican incursion into Texas that year, and barely escaped capture during a failed attempt by Texans to raid into Mexico in an effort known as the Mier (or Somervell) expedition.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P5'>When Texas entered the Union, McCulloch was elected to the state’s first legislature in 1845. The next year, he was appointed major general in command of all Texas state troops west of the Colorado River. When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, he commanded a company of Rangers that became the lead scouting unit under General Zachary Taylor’s army. He became famous for his daring raids into Mexican lines and participated in the Battle of Monterrey and the Battle of Buena Vista.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P6'>After the Mexican-American War, McCulloch briefly lived in California, hoping to become rich in the gold rush that sparked in 1848. That endeavor did not pay off, but he did serve as sheriff of Sacramento before returning to Texas by the early 1850s. In 1852, he received an appointment as U.S. marshal for the Eastern District of Texas. He held that position through most of the 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P7'>When Texas declared its secession from the Union on February 1, 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, McCulloch volunteered for Confederate service and received a commission as colonel. He led Texas militia troops to confront U.S. Army installations in Texas, and captured all federal property in San Antonio on February 16. Three months later, he was promoted to brigadier general and received command of Confederate forces in Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma). He participated in the Confederate victory at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek in Missouri in August 1861. However, he clashed with Confederate general Sterling Price of Missouri, leading to Major General Earl Van Dorn taking command over both men.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P8'>On March 7, 1862, McCulloch commanded the Confederate right wing at the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas. His soldiers successfully captured a Union artillery battery that morning, but the federal troops rallied and held up the Confederate advance. McCulloch personally rode forward to observe the enemy positions. A Union rifleman (possibly Peter Pelican of the Thirty-sixth Illinois Infantry Regiment) spotted the Confederate officer on horseback and fired.  The shot instantly killed McCulloch. His body lay between the Confederate and Union lines, and his second-in-command, Brigadier General James M. McIntosh, was killed leading a cavalry charge to retrieve it. The loss of McCulloch and McIntosh disorganized much of the Confederate line, allowing Union forces to turn the tide of battle and defeat the Confederates at Pea Ridge.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63183P9'>McCulloch’s remains were initially buried on the battlefield of Pea Ridge. He was later moved to Little Rock and then to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS48994P0'>Gideon Johnson Pillow was a general in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War and later served as a general for the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P1'>Born June 8, 1806, in Williamson County, Tennessee, Pillow grew up in Tennessee and graduated from the University of Nashville in 1827. He entered the legal profession in Columbia, Tennessee, becoming partners with future-president James K. Polk. In the early 1830s, Pillow’s public standing increased as he received an appointment as a district attorney general in Tennessee and received a commission as a brigadier general in the Tennessee Militia. His future was further boosted by the election of his friend James K. Polk as U.S. president in 1844.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P2'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Polk appointed Pillow a brigadier general. He led troops in several battles, and was wounded at both Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. Pillow was promoted to major general in 1847, but soon ran into conflict with Major General Winfield Scott when the latter accused Pillow exaggerating his role at various engagements—a charge supported by the fact that Pillow likely wrote an anonymous letter to a New Orleans newspaper crediting himself with the American battle victories at Contreras and Churubusco. When Scott arrested Pillow for insubordination and violating military regulations, Pillow wrote to President Polk with accusations that Scott had tried to bribe Mexican leader Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to end the war. In response, Polk relieved Scott of command of U.S. forces in Mexico in February 1848. The matter was eventually settled with Pillow’s charges dropped and Scott reinstated as general-in-chief of the army, but critics of Pillow—including Scott—argued that he was self-serving and willing to lie for personal gain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P3'>Pillow returned to Tennessee after the Mexican-American War and became involved in politics during the 1850s. He attended the 1850 Nashville Convention, which was a meeting among southern leaders to discuss possible responses if the federal government prohibited slavery in territories won from Mexico in the recent war. Some delegates proposed secession, but Pillow and a majority of the other attendees opposed disunion and supported a compromise with the north. Pillow was active in Democratic politics, unsuccessfully vying to be a vice presidential candidate in 1852 and 1856, as well as a failed bid to secure a seat in the U.S. Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P4'>Pillow supported Tennessee when the state declared itself seceded from the Union at the outbreak of the Civil War. He received a commission as a major general in the state’s militia, and then in July 1861 received an appointment as brigadier general in the Confederate army. In September 1861, under orders from Major General Leonidas Polk, Pillow led Confederate troops into Kentucky as an effort to secure that state for the Confederacy. The move proved to be a monumental blunder, as the Kentucky government and many of its citizens saw the incursion as an assault upon their state’s neutrality, thereby securing Kentucky for the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P5'>Pillow gained some fame in the Confederacy following the Battle of Belmont in December 1861, when his force held off an attack by Ulysses S. Grant. He was then placed in command of Confederate troops at Fort Donelson in February 1862, where he led a successful attack to break out of the fort before Grant’s entire force could surround it. Despite achieving that initial objective, Pillow inexplicably withdrew his soldiers for resupply, allowing Union forces to close the gap. With defeat inevitable, Pillow passed command of the fort to a subordinate and escaped before the Confederates surrendered.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P6'>The events at Fort Donelson marred Pillow’s reputation, and he was briefly suspended from command by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. However, in December 1862, Pillow received another chance at command when he was placed in charge of a brigade within the Army of Tennessee under General Braxton Bragg. During the Battle of Murfreesboro, December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863, Pillow reportedly hid behind a tree while his brigade participated in an assault. Receiving criticism for his performance, Pillow was removed from field command and placed in charge of recruiting and conscription for the Army of Tennessee. During the final months of the war he served as Commissary General of Prisoners, before surrendering to Union forces in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P7'>Pillow, who had been one of the wealthiest landowners in Tennessee in 1860, was bankrupt after the war. He rebuilt some of his wealth with a successful law practice in Memphis with former Tennessee governor Isham G. Harris. He died of yellow fever on October 8, 1878, in Arkansas. Pillow had been married twice, first to Mary Martin (who died in 1869) and then to Mary Eliza Dickson (who was forty years his junior). Pillow had eleven children with his first wife and three with his second wife. Pillow is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P.
