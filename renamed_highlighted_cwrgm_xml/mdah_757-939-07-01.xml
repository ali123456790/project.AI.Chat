                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

<p xml:id='OTPS25024605P2'>After the war, Chandler became active in Republican politics in Mississippi and held various public offices, including a circuit court judge in the mid-1870s and as U.S. District Attorney for Mississippi’s Northern District in the late 1870s. He moved to Tennessee in 1890, where he practiced law, conducted business in real estate, and served as the city recorded in Johnson City for two terms. Chandler died on April 14, 1905, in Johnson City, Tennessee. He was married to Martha Glovinia Croft and had at least five children. He is buried in Monte Vista Memorial Park in Johnson City, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94528P0'>John William O’Ferrall was a high ranking officer in the Mississippi state troops during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94528P1'>Born on September 23, 1823, in Martinsburg, Virginia (currently in West Virginia), O’Ferrall grew up in Berkeley Springs, Virginia, before moving to Enterprise, Mississippi, in the mid-1850s. He found success as a businessman and merchant, aiding his standing in the community. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, O’Ferrall volunteered for military service in Mississippi and was elected captain of the “Enterprise Guards,” a militia company raised for twelve months of service to the state. He led the company to Pensacola, Florida, to aid in the defense of Confederate-held forts along the coast.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94528P2'>In July 1861, O’Ferrall received a promotion to brigadier general of Mississippi state troops and was placed in command of the Army of Mississippi’s Fourth Brigade. He remained in command of that force for only a few months before his two regiments were activated for service in the Confederate army. O’Ferrall did not transfer to Confederate service and instead returned to civilian life at his home in Enterprise. Later he received a commission as captain in the state troops, but wanting higher standing and a more active role in the war effort, O’Ferrall volunteered for service in the Confederate army within the quartermaster corps. Rebuffed in these efforts, he instead received an appointment as a tax collector in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94528P3'>Following the Civil War, O’Ferrall remained active in business affairs, including work as a cotton factor and insurance agent, and was among the wealthiest individuals in the community. He served in local public office in the 1880s, including on the Enterprise city council and his district’s Board of Public Works. O’Ferrall died on December 10, 1895. He was married twice, first to Margaret Rew Tolson, who passed away in 1867. His second wife was Helen Gains Walton. He had at least five children that survived to adulthood. O’Ferrall is buried in Enterprise Cemetery in Enterprise, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P0'>Unlike professional soldiers who may rotate through many units during the course of a military career, most Civil War soldiers were civilians who volunteered only for wartime service and expected to serve their military commitment in their original units. Since units were frequently raised among citizens of a local area, soldiers usually had great pride in their state and regimental affiliations and wanted to remain with their friends and relatives. Additionally, Union and Confederate armies did not normally send replacement soldiers to old regiments to fill the places of men lost from disease, battle, or desertion (Union and Confederate officials preferred to place new recruits in new regiments). Except for officers, who could receive a promotion and transfer to a new command, it was relatively rare for individual soldiers to transfer to a different unit during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P1'>Incidents in which soldiers did transfer into other existing units occurred due to special circumstances. Examples involved direct requests by individuals seeking membership in units with relatives or to leave a unit based upon discontent with the officers. Some requested transfer to a unit with a specialized assignment, or to switch from state guard service to national service or vice versa. In some cases, soldiers were transferred to other units for disciplinary purposes or because of variations in enlistment commitments. Both of these latter scenarios occurred with the 2nd Maine Infantry Regiment. More than sixty soldiers from the unit, who had volunteered for three months, became insubordinate when not allowed to return home after ninety days and were transferred to a New York regiment as a commutation of their original prison sentence. Then, when the 2nd Maine Infantry mustered out of service in June 1863, one hundred and twenty soldiers still owed one year of service, and were transferred to the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment to complete their commitment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P2'>Overall, individual transfer to a different unit was uncommon during the Civil War, and typically occurred on account of special circumstances or by special request. (National Park Service; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.
