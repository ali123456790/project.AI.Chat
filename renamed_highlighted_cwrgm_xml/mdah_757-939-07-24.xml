                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
