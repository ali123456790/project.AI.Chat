                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51698P0'>Thomas Jesse Wharton was attorney general of Mississippi during the Civil War and a circuit judge after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P1'>Born on May 18, 1817, in Nashville, Tennessee, Wharton was a good student and graduated from Nashville law school at the age of 19. He moved to Clinton, Mississippi, in 1836 to practice law, but returned to Tennessee the following year, where he married Mary Edgar. The couple had nine children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P2'>Around 1839 Wharton and his wife moved to Raymond, Mississippi. In 1856, he was appointed the state’s attorney general and his family moved to Jackson. He remained in that position for eight years, including during most of the Civil War. During the secession crisis of 1861, Wharton also served as a commissioner to Tennessee, tasked with encouraging his native state to secede and join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P3'>After the Civil War, Wharton returned to law practice. In 1882, after Reconstruction, he was selected judge of the Seventh Judicial District. He held that position until 1886. Wharton died on January 28, 1900. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P0'>The tag "Confederate War Dissenters" refers to the white men and women who opposed or challenged the Confederacy internally. The South, even among whites, had never been socially, culturally, or economically homogenous. Indeed, many white southerners lived in rural hill country unsuitable for large-scale agriculture, and many of those white southerners were too impoverished to own enslaved persons. However, they nonetheless joined the Confederacy and went to war to preserve a broader social and economic structure predicated upon slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P1'>As the war drug on into its second and third years, its massive bloodshed and devastating economic impacts exposed the fault lines between socially and economically elite and non-elite in the Confederacy. White men, women, and children living in the Confederacy protested government policies like the Twenty Slave Law that exempted largely-elite enslavers from conscription if they owned twenty or more enslaved persons. Dissent could take many forms—ranging from private correspondence to boycotts, riots, and military rebellion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P2'>One of the largest instances of dissent within the Confederacy came in the Bread Riots of 1863. The Confederacy, notoriously unable to collect taxes, required citizens unable to pay taxes with currency to pay with a "tax-in-kind," or a payment of taxes with its equivalent in goods or livestock. This policy disproportionately affected impoverished women and children barely subsisting and often starving due to the loss of their husbands and fathers off fighting in the war. Women therefore rioted in the Confederate capital at Richmond, as well as in many other cities, in the spring of 1863 to demand bread from the Confederate government. The Bread Riots are only one example of many in which white southerners opposed varied elements of the war effort as it disproportionately subjected them to harm. Crucially, not all dissenters were pro-Union, as many supported the Confederacy's mission but not its policies (American Heritage).
