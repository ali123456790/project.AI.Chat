                    <p xml:id='OTPS91595P0'>Reuben Davis was a U.S. congressman from Mississippi and a Mississippi militia general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P1'>Born in Winchester, Tennessee, on January 18, 1813, Davis moved with his family to Alabama as a child and later to Mississippi as a young man. He initially studied medicine, but found his passion lay more in the study of law. He was admitted to the bar in 1834 in Aberdeen, Mississippi, and over the next several years became a prominent criminal attorney. He served as the prosecuting attorney for the sixth judicial district in the late 1830s and turned his interests to politics. He made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. House of Representatives as a member of the Whig Party in 1838.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P2'>Davis volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War, receiving a commission as colonel of the Second Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers. He served in Mexico, but reportedly suffered from medical problems and eventually resigned his position, having not seen combat. Davis returned to Mississippi and during the next few years resumed his political aspirations. He won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1856. Serving during a period of growing tensions over slavery, especially in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which opened western territories to slavery, Davis was among the prominent southern voices in Congress defending the institution of slavery and easily won reelection in 1858. He adopted a strong secessionist sentiment, and advocated for southern unity against Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860. Davis resigned his congressional seat upon Mississippi’s secession and received an appointment as a general on the state’s military board.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P3'>In late 1861, Davis was placed in command of the Army of 10,000—a unit of Mississippi soldiers who had volunteered for sixty days—in a campaign to Kentucky. The militia force actually numbered fewer than 5,000 men, and its short-term enlistments left little time for formal training or organization. As a result, the Army of 10,000 was poorly prepared for field service, and the volunteers spent their entire time in Kentucky in camp, suffering from cold weather and disease, before returning home in January 1862. Davis’s reputation as a military commander suffered as a result of the event.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P4'>In 1862, Davis left the Mississippi militia and reentered politics. He won election to the Confederate House of Representatives and soon became a vocal critic of President Jefferson Davis (no relation), in particular over the Confederate government’s efforts to draft men into military service. Reuben Davis resigned his congressional seat in 1863 and unsuccessfully ran for governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P5'>After the war, Davis initially resumed his law practice. However, he became involved in efforts to undermine Republican Reconstruction, making speeches and rallying white Mississippians to oppose African American rights. Shortly after Reconstruction ended, Davis broke from the Democratics to join the Greenback Party—an independent, anti-monopoly political party that united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters. He ran for Congress as a Greenback candidate in 1878, but lost. That was Davis’s last bid for political office. He largely retired from public life and wrote his memoir, entitled <hi rend='italic'>Recollections of Mississippi and Mississippians,</hi>. Davis died on October 24, 1890. He had been married twice, first to Mary Theodosia Halbert who passed away in 1865, and then to Sarah Virginia Garber. He had three children. Davis is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS84072P0'>Absolom Madden West was a Confederate general, a Mississippi politician, railroad executive, and vice presidential candidate. Born in Alabama in 1818, West moved to Mississippi around 1837 to establish a plantation with property he acquired from federal land grants. He entered Mississippi state politics as a Whig and won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1847. He married Caroline O. Glover in the 1840s and the couple had four surviving children, born between 1849 and 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P1'>In 1853, he took an office job with the new Mississippi Central Railroad, gaining experience not only in railroad development but corporate and logistical operations. As a Whig, West originally opposed secession. However, after Mississippi left the Union in 1861, during the secession crisis that split the country following Abraham Lincon’s election to president in November 1860, West offered his loyalty and services to the state. He was promoted a brigadier general in the Mississippi state militia, and helped raised a regiment of volunteers. Recognizing his skill and experience in administrative and logistical work, state officials appointed him to several different managerial roles, such as quartermaster general, paymaster general, and commissary general of the militia. He made recommendations to the state legislature to improve the accounting of funds, and was the only state officer to have his accounting books in order and submitted at the end of the war.

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P2'>West took the role of president over the Mississippi Central Railroad around 1864. He remained in that position until around the end of the war, then returned to state politics—again serving in the Mississippi Senate—after the Illinois Central purchased the Mississippi Central. West was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the early effort by the Mississippi government in 1865 to earn readmission to the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, he was among the Mississippi delegation refused seats in Congress when Republicans in Washington, D.C., objected to Mississippi’s “Black Codes”—a series of highly discriminatory laws passed in the summer of 1865 to restrict the civil rights of African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P3'>West became involved in labor rights during Reconstruction, helping form a branch of the National Labor Union. Reentering the Mississippi Senate in the early 1870s, around 1876 he broke away from the Democratic Party and joined the emerging “Greenback Party”—an independent, anti-monopoly political party. It united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters, namely the expansion of paper currency believed to help farmers and small businesses. Attesting to the party’s ability to bring former enemies together, the party’s national convention in 1884 nominated former Union general Benjamin Butler (who had been despised within the Confederacy during his occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War) for its presidential candidate and the former Confederate militia general West as vice president. The party polled only a 1.7% of the popular vote in 1884.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P4'>West’s wife Caroline died in 1889 after a long bout of poor health. He died five years later, in 1894.  The couple is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
