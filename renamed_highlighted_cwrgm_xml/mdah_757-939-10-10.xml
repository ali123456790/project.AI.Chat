                    <p xml:id='OTPS76776P0'>Samuel Gibbs French was a northern-born general of the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P1'>Born near Mullica Hill, New Jersey, on November 28, 1818, French was raised in the north and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating from West Point in 1843, he was placed with the Third United States Artillery and served at posts in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. During the Mexican-American War, French performed well in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, and Monterrey, receiving the brevet (honorary) rank of first lieutenant for his actions. In February 1847, he was wounded during the Battle of Buena Vista, but remained on the field during the fighting. Following the battle, he received the brevet rank of captain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P2'>After recuperating in New Jersey from his wound, French was appointed assistant quartermaster in the general staff of the army. By 1849 he was able to resume field operations and carried out assignments in Texas and Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1853 he married Eliza Matilda Roberts of Mississippi. The couple had one daughter. Through his wife's family, French received a plantation near Greenville, Mississippi. In 1856, he resigned from the army to manage the property. The following year, Eliza passed away.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P3'>Following Mississippi’s secession in January 1861, French offered to support his adopted state and the Confederacy. He received a commission as a lieutenant colonel and chief of ordnance in the Army of Mississippi in February 1861. News of his support of the Confederacy reportedly sparked furor in New Jersey, leading to protestors ransacking French’s summer home in Woodbury and burning him in effigy. In October 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate Army and received an assignment to oversee the defense of the Potomac River in Virginia. For much of 1862 and 1863, French led efforts to create and improve defensive works in Virginia and North Carolina, including Fort Fisher (which was the among the Confederacy’s most elaborate defensive positions) and Petersburg (whose earthworks frustrated Union assaults for several months in 1864). French also led troops in the field, participating in fighting at Harrison’s Landing in July 1862 and Suffolk, Virginia, in September 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P4'>In 1863 French was transferred to the western theater, where he commanded a division under General Joseph E. Johnston during the unsuccessful effort to relieve Confederate troops besieged at Vicksburg, Mississippi. French continued to serve in the Mississippi area in late 1863 and early 1864, before being transferred to the Army of Tennessee in May 1864 to aid in the defense of Atlanta against William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army. He remained in the field, commanding a division during the Confederate advance into Tennessee in the fall of 1864. His soldiers took heavy casualties during the Confederate defeat at Franklin, Tennessee, and French was forced to take medical leave due to an eye infection that nearly left him blind. His last military assignment was the defense of Mobile, Alabama. He and his men held out until April 1865, when they surrendered to Union troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P5'>In 1865, French married Mary Fontaine Abercrombie. The couple had three kids and variously lived in Mississippi, New Jersey, Georgia, and Florida. When the United States entered the Spanish-American War in 1898, the 79-year old French—who had participated in thirty-five battles during the Mexican-American War and Civil War—reportedly volunteered for service. President William McKinley turned down his offer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P6'>French wrote a memoir entitled <hi rend='italic'>Two Wars: An Autobiography of Samuel G. French</hi>, which laid heavy criticism on several Confederate officials, including Mississippi governor John J. Pettus, General William J. Hardee, General John Bell Hood, and General Leonidas Polk. He also remained highly critical of the north, blaming the Civil War on anti-slavery northerners. French died on April 20, 1910, in Alabama while visiting one of his children. He is buried in Saint John’s Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of Southern History</hi>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum)
