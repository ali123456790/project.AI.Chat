                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD83857P0'>In both the North and the South, women formed as many as 20,000 Ladies Military Aid Societies (also called Soldiers’ Aid Societies) throughout the Civil War. Nearly every town and village had its own version. Organized and run locally by women, these societies supported soldiers by providing food and textile goods, including clothing, socks, tents, and bandages. Within the first month of the war, southern organizations also made cartridges and prepared sandbags. Working with local and state politicians, women also developed transportation networks to move gathered supplies into the field. Some women  even personally transported the supplies through these networks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P1'>Initially, Black women also supported these largely white women’s societies in the North, but the introduction of Black regiments in 1863 led Black women to create their own military aid societies, like the Colored Ladies Soldiers’ Aid Society of St. Louis, Missouri. These groups focused specifically on the needs of Black soldiers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P2'>Over the course of the war, these societies expanded their goals to include aiding soldiers’ families and the local poor, as well as taking on new roles as nurses. In the North, this impulse eventually led to the creation of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, Western Sanitary Commission, and the Central Association for Relief, which were dedicated to the support of sick and wounded U.S. soldiers. Reliant on private donations, these groups organized fundraisers, including social events like concerts, dinners, and dances. This sharpened women’s organizational and political skills, although most women stayed within the traditional domestic sphere.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P3'>Ladies Military Aid Societies continued their operations after the war. In the North, their aims shifted towards veteran and orphan care, including helping families apply for pensions and providing direct aid for disabled soldiers. In the South, in addition to assisting veterans, these societies often became memorial associations, which were active in creating Confederate cemeteries and monuments. (Beverly C. Tomek, “Women and Soldiers’ Aid Societies; Wikipedia; Nina Silber, <hi rend='italic'>Gender &amp; the Sectional Conflict</hi>)
