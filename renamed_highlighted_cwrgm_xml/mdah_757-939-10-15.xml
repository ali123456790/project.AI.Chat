                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63182P0'>John Buchanan Floyd was a politician who served as governor of Virginia, U.S. secretary of war, and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P1'>Born on June 1, 1806, near Blacksburg, Virginia, Floyd graduated from South Carolina College in 1826 and became a practicing attorney in Virginia in 1828. He moved to Arkansas to become a cotton planter, but the effort failed, costing him a large amount of money. Floyd moved back to Virginia in 1839 and soon became active in local politics. In 1847, he won election to the Virginia House of Delegates and was elected governor of Virginia in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P2'>Floyd left the governor’s office in 1852 and returned to the House of Delegates. He remained active in Democratic Party politics. In 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Floyd U.S. secretary of war. Although a popular politician, he proved to be a poor administrator. Apart from being criticized for his handling of a U.S. Army campaign against Mormons over control of Utah Territory in 1857 and 1858, Floyd was accused of fraud in the “Abstracted Indian Bonds” scandal in 1860, prompting Buchanan to request his resignation. Floyd left office in disgrace on December 29, 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P3'>Almost immediately after his resignation—as southern states began declaring secession from the Union—federal officials investigated whether Floyd had, as secretary of war, intentionally sent federal weapons and equipment to arsenals and forts in the south to make them more easily accessible to capture by secessionists. A District of Columbia grand jury indicted him in late January 1861, but the court dismissed the charges a few weeks later.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P4'>After Virginia declared its separation from the Union, following the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter and Abraham Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion against federal authority, Floyd volunteered for Confederate service. He was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate army in May 1861 and sent to support Robert E. Lee in western Virginia in the fall of 1861. Floyd’s aptitude on the battlefield appeared to match his limitations as secretary of war. He was defeated at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry and blamed his loss on Brigadier General Henry Wise. The feud between the two Confederate generals grew so heated that Confederate president Jefferson Davis had to intervene. Shortly afterwards, Floyd was sent to the western theater to support General Albert Sidney Johnston in Tennessee. Johnston placed Floyd in command of Confederate troops at Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P5'>Shortly after Floyd arrived at Fort Donelson in February 1862, Union troops under Ulysses S. Grant surrounded it. With little military experience, Floyd deferred to some of his subordinates, such as Brigadier General Gideon Pillow and Brigadier General Simon Bolivar Buckner. Although the Confederates conducted a successful attack to break out of the besieged fort, indecision and poor leadership by the Confederate command allowed Grant to counterattack and surround them again. Fearing that he would be arrested for treason if captured, Floyd relinquished command to Pillow, who in turn handed over command to Buckner. Floyd and Pillow fled the fort, although in different ways—Pillow took a small boat across the river while Floyd rode a steamboat with several Confederate soldiers away from the fort—leaving Buckner to surrender the fort and its garrison in one of the first major Union victories of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P6'>Floyd’s abandonment of Fort Donelson ruined his Confederate army career. Jefferson Davis relieved him of command in March 1862. He returned to Virginia where he served as a general in the Virginia militia, but he played little part in military affairs due to failing health. He died on August 26, 1863. Floyd was married to Sarah Preston but had no children. He is buried in Sinking Spring Cemetery in Abingdon, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS95937P0'>Charles Baskerville was a Confederate officer from Mississippi during the Civil War. Born in Virginia in 1821, Baskerville moved to Mississippi in the 1850s. He was a successful businessman in Columbus on the eve of the Civil War, and when hostilities broke out in 1861, he helped raise a cavalry battalion in Mississippi, variously known as the Second Battalion, the Fourth Battalion, and the Pope Walker Battalion. He served as an officer of the battalion, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Baskerville led cavalry troops through many engagements in the Mississippi and Tennessee area.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95937P1'>He survived the war and returned to Mississippi, passing away on June 23, 1890. He was married twice, first to Margaret Haynes Freear, who died in 1853. He then married Jane Coleman. Baskerville had at least five children. He is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.
