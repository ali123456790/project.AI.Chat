                    <p xml:id='OTPS94766P0'>Albert Sidney Johnston served as a general in three different national armies, the last being with the Confederacy. Born on February 2, 1803, in Washington, Kentucky, Johnston moved to Texas at a young age. He attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduating there in 1826. His early military assignments involved campaigns against Native Americans in Wisconsin and Illinois.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P1'>Johnston married Henrietta Preston in 1829 and had two children. In 1834, he resigned from the army to care for his wife, who began suffering from tuberculosis and eventually died in 1836. Shortly afterward, Johnston moved to Texas, at that time an independent republic. He volunteered for military service, receiving the rank of colonel and an appointment as Adjutant General in 1836. The following year he was promoted to brigadier general in command of the Texas army. In 1838, Johnston received an appointment as Secretary of War for the Texas Republic. He actively participated in field campaigns during the Cherokee War in 1838 and 1839. In 1840, he resigned and moved back to Kentucky. He remarried in 1843, to Eliza Griffin, and returned to Texas to a plantation called “China Grove” in Brazoria County. He and Eliza had four more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P2'>Johnston volunteered for U.S. military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846. He initially commanded a regiment of Texas volunteers, but later received an appointment as inspector general of a division commanded by Brigadier General William O. Butler. When Butler was wounded and carried off the field at the Battle of Monterrey, Johnston took command of the brigade. His performance there was widely praised, including by General Zachary Taylor who reportedly called Johnston the finest soldier he had commanded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P3'>Johnston resigned from the U.S. Army shortly after the Battle of Monterrey, in accordance with a promise to his wife to only serve six months in Mexico. Additionally, he believed his political affiliation with the Whig Party likely hindered promotion from President James K. Polk’s Democratic administration. He returned to his plantation in Texas. Following the Mexican-American War, Johnston received an offer to serve as a U.S. Army paymaster for soldiers in Texas—now part of the United States—and in 1855 he was promoted to colonel in command of the Second United States Cavalry Regiment. His subordinates in that unit included future Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, William J. Hardee, Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and John Bell Hood, as well as future Union generals George H. Thomas and George Stoneman. As a cavalry commander, Johnston saw extensive field operations in the west, fighting Comanches in Texas and then in Utah during the U.S. government’s conflict with Mormon settlers there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P4'>With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, initially opposed secession but then offered his services to the Confederacy. A slaveowner himself, Johnston was entirely opposed to northern anti-slavery policies and abolitionism. He resigned from his position as commander of the U.S. Army’s Department of the Pacific in California and joined a pro-Confederate militia unit in Los Angeles. In the summer of 1861, he traveled east to the Confederacy and received command of all Confederate forces in the Western Department. Confederate President Jefferson Davis who greatly admired Johnston, having known him since they were students together at Transylvania University and West Point, promoted him to full general on August 31, 1861. Johnston’s command consisted of fewer than 40,000 soldiers tasked with defending the Confederacy from Union incursions around Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, and Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P5'>Despite some early Confederate successes in the west in 1861, such as the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, Union troops made important gains in early 1862, capturing Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. Johnston was forced to withdraw and consolidate his troops at Corinth, Mississippi. Then, in early April 1862, Johnston learned that Union soldiers under Ulysses S. Grant were encamped at Pittsburg Landing along the Tennessee River in southwest Tennessee awaiting reinforcements. Johnston ordered his Army of Mississippi northward in a bold plan to surprise and destroy Grant’s army. On April 6, 1862, Johnston’s Confederates launched an early morning assault through thick woods near a small church named Shiloh, outside the Union encampment at Pittsburg Landing. The federal troops were caught off guard and pressed back, though several Union regiments stubbornly held their ground that morning, leading to intense musketry and artillery fire. Johnston rode forward to lead part of an attack on a Union defensive position nicknamed the “Hornet’s Nest.” As he sat on his horse encouraging his soldiers, a bullet struck him in the leg, behind the knee. The wound severed the artery, causing rapid blood loss. Only when he slumped in his saddle did Johnston’s staff officers realize that something was wrong. One officer asked Johnston if he had been wounded. The general, pale from the loss of blood, responded, “Yes, and I fear seriously.” By the time his staff officers carried him from his horse to a ravine for cover, Johnston was unconscious. He died of blood loss before a physician arrived. Johnston’s subordinate, General P. G. T. Beauregard, took command of the Army of Mississippi shortly afterwards. Although initially successful during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh, the Confederate army was beaten the following day by a Union counterattack, and forced to retreat back to Corinth.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P6'>Johnston’s death was considered a major loss to the Confederacy, as he was described by many—especially Jefferson Davis—as the south’s greatest general at that time. Johnston’s widow and most of his children remained in California, although one son also joined the Confederacy but was killed in a steamboat accident in 1863. Johnston’s remains were initially buried in New Orleans but moved shortly after the war to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32028070P0'>Charles Albert Brougher served as Mississippi’s secretary of state in the 1860s. Born on June 19, 1824, in Morgan County, Alabama, Brougher moved to Mississippi at a young age, as his father entered politics there, serving in the Mississippi Senate in the early 1840s. Brougher graduated from Pennsylvania College (modern-day Gettysburg College) in 1846 and initially went into teaching. He then took up the study of law, and became a practicing attorney in Ripley, Mississippi in 1852.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028070P1'>In 1858, Brougher was elected Clerk of Mississippi’s House of Representatives. In 1860, he was appointed Mississippi’s secretary of state, to fill the vacancy created when B. R. Webb died in that office only six days into his first term. Brougher remained in that position through the secession crisis and first two years of the Civil War. He won reelection in 1863, and only left the secretary of state’s office when Union authorities took civil control of Mississippi in June 1865. Brougher was elected to the seat again in October 1865 and served until 1869. Brougher died on November 25, 1891. He was married to Marie Louise Earle and had seven children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92926P0'>During the Civil War, Confederate military authorities used different levels of operational command to oversee their growing military forces and to respond to federal campaigns against the south. The military department proved to be one of the more effective levels of command for territorial areas. The department commanders reported directly to the Confederate War Department and Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Initially Confederate officials created military departments only for areas directly under federal attack. As the war developed, they created departments to cover the entire Confederacy. Confederate authorities restructured the departments as the war developed, and Union forces captured some parts of the Confederacy or military campaigns created new military needs in geographical areas. Some old departments were dissolved, or divided, and territories placed within new departments designed for contemporary needs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92926P1'>The first department to include parts of Mississippi was the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, established on October 1, 1862. It existed until January 28, 1864, when Confederate authorities created the new department of Alabama and East Mississippi. That department lasted until August 15, 1864, and the creation of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana, which lasted until May 1865 and the end of the war.
