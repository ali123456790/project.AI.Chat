                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25006289P0'>Samuel Cooper was a long-serving U.S. Army officer who became adjutant general and one of the highest ranking officers of the Confederate Army during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006289P1'>Born on June 12, 1798, in New Hackensack, New York, Cooper graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1815, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Light Artillery that same year. He went on to serve in various U.S. artillery units for the next twenty-two years, until being appointed chief clerk of the U.S. War Department in 1838. Shortly afterwards, he received an appointment as assistant adjutant general (an administrative position) for the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006289P2'>Cooper saw service in the field in Florida in the early 1840s as a staff officer to Colonel William J. Worth during the Second Seminole War. He returned to Washington D.C. and continued to serve, and gain promotion, as an administrative officer. He received the rank of colonel in 1852. Besides his strict military service, Cooper briefly held the role as acting Secretary of War in 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006289P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Cooper resigned from the U.S. Army and offered his services to the Confederacy. Although he had been born and raised in the north, Cooper was married to a Virginian, Sarah Mason, and had a strong relationship with Jefferson Davis, who had served as Secretary of War and was elected president of the Confederate States of America. Cooper was commissioned as a brigadier general in the Confederate army and appointed the dual role as adjutant general and inspector general, duties he maintained for the entire war. On May 16, 1861, he was promoted full general, one of only seven men to receive that high rank in the Confederate army. Based upon his date of commission, Cooper technically outranked more famous Confederate generals, such as P. G. T. Beauregard, Joseph E. Johnston, and Robert E. Lee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006289P4'>After the Civil War, Cooper moved back to Virginia. His home had been destroyed during the war by Union troops angered by his service to the Confederacy, and he lived in a former overseer’s house on the property. In near poverty and at an advanced age, he was forced to accept donations from other Confederate veterans. He died on December 3, 1876. He and his wife Sarah had at least three children. He is buried in Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS86155P0'>John H. Echols was secretary of state, state treasurer, and a revenue agent in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P1'>Born on September 1, 1835, in Huntsville, Alabama, Echols moved to Jackson, Mississippi, during his childhood. He worked for the state government as a young man, and impressed Mississippi officials so much with his intellect and abilities that he was appointed secretary of state during the Civil War. Shortly after the war ended, Echols was appointed state treasurer. He held the position until 1869, maintaining a reputation for integrity and intelligence.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P2'>In 1871, he took a job as a commissioner and agent of the Mobile &amp; Northwestern Railroad, a position that required salesmanship to receive land and money donations to the railroad’s development. Then, in 1876, he was appointed a revenue agent for Mississippi, a position created that year by the state legislature to investigate and litigate cases in which county tax collections were not properly submitted to the state government. He worked as the revenue agent until 1880.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P3'>Echols suffered from Bright’s disease—a kidney ailment—and died on January 29, 1882, after weeks of failing health. He was married twice, first to Medora Ware, who passed away in 1875. He then married Sarah Schackleford. Echols is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

Will you instruct M<add place='above'>r</add> <rs ref='#S86155'>Echols</rs> to forward them without delay. I would not trouble you about the Blanks but I can not get them without

            <note resp="#U226410">NOTE: I am certain that this refers to the Copiah Horse Guards, formed by men from Copiah County Mississippi in March 1861. The Roster confirms that the Company Captain was T.A. Graves and the 1st Lt. was James M. Norman. Interestingly, the new company formed was known as Norman&#39;s Company of Partisan Rangers and was attached as Company B of the 4th Mississippi Cavalry. They saw duty along the coast of Mississippi and Louisiana until 1865.
