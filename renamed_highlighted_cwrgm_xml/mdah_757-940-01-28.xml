                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94766P0'>Albert Sidney Johnston served as a general in three different national armies, the last being with the Confederacy. Born on February 2, 1803, in Washington, Kentucky, Johnston moved to Texas at a young age. He attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduating there in 1826. His early military assignments involved campaigns against Native Americans in Wisconsin and Illinois.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P1'>Johnston married Henrietta Preston in 1829 and had two children. In 1834, he resigned from the army to care for his wife, who began suffering from tuberculosis and eventually died in 1836. Shortly afterward, Johnston moved to Texas, at that time an independent republic. He volunteered for military service, receiving the rank of colonel and an appointment as Adjutant General in 1836. The following year he was promoted to brigadier general in command of the Texas army. In 1838, Johnston received an appointment as Secretary of War for the Texas Republic. He actively participated in field campaigns during the Cherokee War in 1838 and 1839. In 1840, he resigned and moved back to Kentucky. He remarried in 1843, to Eliza Griffin, and returned to Texas to a plantation called “China Grove” in Brazoria County. He and Eliza had four more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P2'>Johnston volunteered for U.S. military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846. He initially commanded a regiment of Texas volunteers, but later received an appointment as inspector general of a division commanded by Brigadier General William O. Butler. When Butler was wounded and carried off the field at the Battle of Monterrey, Johnston took command of the brigade. His performance there was widely praised, including by General Zachary Taylor who reportedly called Johnston the finest soldier he had commanded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P3'>Johnston resigned from the U.S. Army shortly after the Battle of Monterrey, in accordance with a promise to his wife to only serve six months in Mexico. Additionally, he believed his political affiliation with the Whig Party likely hindered promotion from President James K. Polk’s Democratic administration. He returned to his plantation in Texas. Following the Mexican-American War, Johnston received an offer to serve as a U.S. Army paymaster for soldiers in Texas—now part of the United States—and in 1855 he was promoted to colonel in command of the Second United States Cavalry Regiment. His subordinates in that unit included future Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, William J. Hardee, Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and John Bell Hood, as well as future Union generals George H. Thomas and George Stoneman. As a cavalry commander, Johnston saw extensive field operations in the west, fighting Comanches in Texas and then in Utah during the U.S. government’s conflict with Mormon settlers there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P4'>With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, initially opposed secession but then offered his services to the Confederacy. A slaveowner himself, Johnston was entirely opposed to northern anti-slavery policies and abolitionism. He resigned from his position as commander of the U.S. Army’s Department of the Pacific in California and joined a pro-Confederate militia unit in Los Angeles. In the summer of 1861, he traveled east to the Confederacy and received command of all Confederate forces in the Western Department. Confederate President Jefferson Davis who greatly admired Johnston, having known him since they were students together at Transylvania University and West Point, promoted him to full general on August 31, 1861. Johnston’s command consisted of fewer than 40,000 soldiers tasked with defending the Confederacy from Union incursions around Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, and Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P5'>Despite some early Confederate successes in the west in 1861, such as the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, Union troops made important gains in early 1862, capturing Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. Johnston was forced to withdraw and consolidate his troops at Corinth, Mississippi. Then, in early April 1862, Johnston learned that Union soldiers under Ulysses S. Grant were encamped at Pittsburg Landing along the Tennessee River in southwest Tennessee awaiting reinforcements. Johnston ordered his Army of Mississippi northward in a bold plan to surprise and destroy Grant’s army. On April 6, 1862, Johnston’s Confederates launched an early morning assault through thick woods near a small church named Shiloh, outside the Union encampment at Pittsburg Landing. The federal troops were caught off guard and pressed back, though several Union regiments stubbornly held their ground that morning, leading to intense musketry and artillery fire. Johnston rode forward to lead part of an attack on a Union defensive position nicknamed the “Hornet’s Nest.” As he sat on his horse encouraging his soldiers, a bullet struck him in the leg, behind the knee. The wound severed the artery, causing rapid blood loss. Only when he slumped in his saddle did Johnston’s staff officers realize that something was wrong. One officer asked Johnston if he had been wounded. The general, pale from the loss of blood, responded, “Yes, and I fear seriously.” By the time his staff officers carried him from his horse to a ravine for cover, Johnston was unconscious. He died of blood loss before a physician arrived. Johnston’s subordinate, General P. G. T. Beauregard, took command of the Army of Mississippi shortly afterwards. Although initially successful during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh, the Confederate army was beaten the following day by a Union counterattack, and forced to retreat back to Corinth.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P6'>Johnston’s death was considered a major loss to the Confederacy, as he was described by many—especially Jefferson Davis—as the south’s greatest general at that time. Johnston’s widow and most of his children remained in California, although one son also joined the Confederacy but was killed in a steamboat accident in 1863. Johnston’s remains were initially buried in New Orleans but moved shortly after the war to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS76776P0'>Samuel Gibbs French was a northern-born general of the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P1'>Born near Mullica Hill, New Jersey, on November 28, 1818, French was raised in the north and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating from West Point in 1843, he was placed with the Third United States Artillery and served at posts in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. During the Mexican-American War, French performed well in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, and Monterrey, receiving the brevet (honorary) rank of first lieutenant for his actions. In February 1847, he was wounded during the Battle of Buena Vista, but remained on the field during the fighting. Following the battle, he received the brevet rank of captain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P2'>After recuperating in New Jersey from his wound, French was appointed assistant quartermaster in the general staff of the army. By 1849 he was able to resume field operations and carried out assignments in Texas and Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1853 he married Eliza Matilda Roberts of Mississippi. The couple had one daughter. Through his wife's family, French received a plantation near Greenville, Mississippi. In 1856, he resigned from the army to manage the property. The following year, Eliza passed away.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P3'>Following Mississippi’s secession in January 1861, French offered to support his adopted state and the Confederacy. He received a commission as a lieutenant colonel and chief of ordnance in the Army of Mississippi in February 1861. News of his support of the Confederacy reportedly sparked furor in New Jersey, leading to protestors ransacking French’s summer home in Woodbury and burning him in effigy. In October 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate Army and received an assignment to oversee the defense of the Potomac River in Virginia. For much of 1862 and 1863, French led efforts to create and improve defensive works in Virginia and North Carolina, including Fort Fisher (which was the among the Confederacy’s most elaborate defensive positions) and Petersburg (whose earthworks frustrated Union assaults for several months in 1864). French also led troops in the field, participating in fighting at Harrison’s Landing in July 1862 and Suffolk, Virginia, in September 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P4'>In 1863 French was transferred to the western theater, where he commanded a division under General Joseph E. Johnston during the unsuccessful effort to relieve Confederate troops besieged at Vicksburg, Mississippi. French continued to serve in the Mississippi area in late 1863 and early 1864, before being transferred to the Army of Tennessee in May 1864 to aid in the defense of Atlanta against William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army. He remained in the field, commanding a division during the Confederate advance into Tennessee in the fall of 1864. His soldiers took heavy casualties during the Confederate defeat at Franklin, Tennessee, and French was forced to take medical leave due to an eye infection that nearly left him blind. His last military assignment was the defense of Mobile, Alabama. He and his men held out until April 1865, when they surrendered to Union troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P5'>In 1865, French married Mary Fontaine Abercrombie. The couple had three kids and variously lived in Mississippi, New Jersey, Georgia, and Florida. When the United States entered the Spanish-American War in 1898, the 79-year old French—who had participated in thirty-five battles during the Mexican-American War and Civil War—reportedly volunteered for service. President William McKinley turned down his offer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P6'>French wrote a memoir entitled <hi rend='italic'>Two Wars: An Autobiography of Samuel G. French</hi>, which laid heavy criticism on several Confederate officials, including Mississippi governor John J. Pettus, General William J. Hardee, General John Bell Hood, and General Leonidas Polk. He also remained highly critical of the north, blaming the Civil War on anti-slavery northerners. French died on April 20, 1910, in Alabama while visiting one of his children. He is buried in Saint John’s Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
