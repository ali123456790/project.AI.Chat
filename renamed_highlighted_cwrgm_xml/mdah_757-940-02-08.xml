                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25015672P0'>James Longstreet was a Confederate general during the Civil War and a Republican official in the south during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P1'>Born on January 8, 1821, in Edgefield District, South Carolina, Longstreet moved to Georgia at the age of nine. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1842. He was a poor student, graduating almost at the bottom of his class, due to his rowdiness and interest in non-academic activities. He was popular, though, and became good friends with several other cadets who would become leading military figures during the Civil War, including future Confederate generals D. H. Hill and George Pickett, and future Union generals George Thomas, William Rosecrans, and John Pope. One of his best friends from West Point was Ulysses S. Grant and the two served together in the Fourth U.S. Infantry Regiment after graduation. Grant married one of Longstreet’s cousins, Julia Dent, and some accounts say that Longstreet served as a groomsman in the wedding.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P2'>Longstreet served as an officer with the Eighth U.S. Infantry Regiment during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848. He performed very well, receiving multiple brevet (honorary) promotions for bravery. At the Battle of Chapultepec, he carried his regiment’s flag in an attack upon a Mexican position, but was shot in the thigh. Unable to continue, Longstreet handed the flag to his friend and West Point classmate George Pickett. After several months of recovering from his wound, Longstreet returned to stateside military service. He married Louise Garland in March 1848 and the couple eventually had ten children. During the 1850s, Longstreet received a variety of assignments, at military posts in New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. He was in Albuquerque serving as a U.S. Army paymaster during the secession crisis that following Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P3'>Following the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, Longstreet resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. Although not a strong supporter of secession, as a native of South Carolina and having spent much of his youth in Georgia, he told his northern comrades that he felt obligated to follow the south. He was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate army in May 1861. He received a promotion to brigadier general in June 1861 and was placed in command of a brigade of Virginians that summer. He participated an engagement at Blackburn’s Ford near Manassas, only three days before the First Battle of Bull Run, and received praise for his bravery. Promoted to major general in October 1861, he received command of a division in the Army of Northern Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P4'>He continued to perform well in several battle in 1862, despite suffering a personal tragedy with three of his children dying of scarlet fever earlier that year. During the Seven Days Battles near Richmond in the spring of 1862, Longstreet commanded nearly half of the army and received praise from his superiors and subordinates. Robert E. Lee took over the Army of Northern Virginia during that campaign, beginning a very close partnership with Longstreet as commander of the army’s Right Wing (later known as the First Corps). At the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862, Longstreet led his command in a crushing attack on the Union army’s left flank, scoring a stunning Confederate victory, and he performed well defending the Confederate line at the Battle of Antietam and the Battle of Fredericksburg. In late 1862, he received a promotion to lieutenant general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P5'>Longstreet disagreed with Lee on the invasion of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1863. Nevertheless, he dutifully followed Lee’s orders in the Battle of Gettysburg, culminating in the disastrous Confederate assault on the Union center on July 3, 1863, famously known as “Pickett’s Charge.” Longstreet had advised against the assault, but facing direct orders from Lee, had given his old U.S. Army friend George Pickett the signal to lead the charge. Longstreet criticized Lee’s actions at Gettysburg, which upset many of his comrades and people across the south due to Lee’s iconic fame in the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P6'>In the fall of 1863, Longstreet received instructions to lead his corps to reinforce Confederate forces near Chattanooga, Tennessee. He arrived in time to play a key role in the Battle of Chickamauga. Although a Confederate victory, fighting among the generals—including between Longstreet and Braxton Bragg—soured Longstreet’s experience in the western theater. Additionally, his effort to defeat Union forces under General Ambrose Burnside at Knoxville, Tennessee, in December 1863 ended badly and he eventually led his troops back to rejoin Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P7'>In 1864, Longstreet returned to his old style of success in battle, handling his soldiers well during the Battle of the Wilderness in Virginia. However, he was badly wounded by friendly fire, which paralyzed his right arm and forced him to spend several months recovering. He returned to the army in October 1864 and helped the Army of Northern Virginia defend Petersburg from Union forces commanded by his old friend Ulysses S. Grant. Longstreet continued to serve in Virginia until Lee’s army was defeated and forced to surrender at Appomattox Court House in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P8'>Following the Civil War, Longstreet moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. He worked in cotton sales and became an executive in various railroad projects. Although largely a Confederate hero during the war, Longstreet’s reputation in the south suffered tremendously when he began supporting Republican policies during Reconstruction. His views were not particularly progressive, as he did not embrace Black civil rights to the degree that northern Republicans did. Instead, he argued that southern whites should join the Republican Party to help control that organization and its Black members. As time went on, though, Longstreet continued to support Republican policies, including greater protections for African Americans. He endorsed Grant for president in 1868 and he received an appointment by Grant a surveyor of customs in New Orleans. He also received a commission a major general in the Louisiana militia, which included commanding Black soldiers in opposition to white conservative violence during the late Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P9'>Many former Confederate generals ostracized Longstreet for his criticism of Lee and embrace of the Republican Party. As such, he was not celebrated in the “Lost Cause” mythology that romanticized the Confederacy and lionized generals like Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. However, Longstreet continued to attend veteran reunions for many years, and remained popular with many of the men who had served under him. His first wife died in 1889 and in 1897, at 75 years old, he married 34-year old Helen Dortch.  Longstreet died on January 2, 1904. He is buried in Alta Vista Cemetery in Gainesville, Georgia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71531P0'>John Jordan Crittenden was an attorney and politician who served in the U.S. Congress and as governor of Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71531P1'>Born on September 10, 1787, near Versailles, Kentucky, Crittenden attended various private schools and academies, including Washington College (modern-day Washington and Lee University) and the College of William and Mary. He became a practicing attorney in 1806 and eventually started a law firm in Russellville, Kentucky. Around 1807 he moved to Illinois Territory and received an appointment as attorney general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71531P2'>Crittenden returned to Kentucky a few years later and entered politics. He won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1811 and served until 1817. During that period, when the War of 1812 broke out, he volunteered for military service and served as a staff officer for the First Kentucky Militia. He was present at the Battle of the Thames in Canada.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71531P3'>In 1814, Crittenden received an appointment to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate. However, he was only 27 years old—three years below the constitutionally established age of 30 to serve in that legislative body—so he was unable to take the position. Instead he was elected speaker of the house in the Kentucky House of Representatives and served until 1817, when again he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate. He served until 1819 and then resigned to return to Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71531P4'>Crittenden continued to be a major political figure as a Whig in Kentucky and national politics. Between 1819 and 1850, his elected and appointed positions included the Kentucky secretary of state, U.S. senator, U.S. attorney general, and governor of Kentucky. He returned to the U.S. Senate in 1855 and was present for some of the most contentious events leading to the secession crisis of 1861. For instance, he tried to intervene when Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina physically attacked Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in the Senate chamber in 1856, and he spoke out strongly against the pro-slavery territorial governments of Kansas, which had been accused of fraud against free state settlers. He labored, unsuccessfully, to moderate the sectional conflict between north and south, and helped form the Constitutional Union Party in 1860. Encouraged to be that party’s presidential candidate, he turned it down and instead recommended John Bell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71531P5'>After Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, sparking a wave of secessionist rhetoric in the south, Crittenden led a political effort to heal the divide and avoid war. Called the Crittenden Compromise, his plan involved six constitutional amendments and four legislative resolutions, that offered compromises on the matter of slavery—such as the restoration of the Missouri Compromise’s line between free and slave territories, formalized protection of slavery in Washington, D.C., and greater northern commitment to the Fugitive Slave Law. Republicans largely rejected the measure, and the plan found little support from southerners who had already embraced secession.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71531P6'>After his compromise plan failed, Crittenden focused his efforts on keeping his home state of Kentucky in the Union. He was elected to a special session of the U.S. House of Representatives in July 1861 and was joint author of the Crittenden-Johnson Resolution, blaming secessionists for the outbreak of war and declaring that the U.S. Army’s objective was preservation of the constitutional Union. Crittenden continued to serve in Congress until he died on July 26, 1863. He was married three times, first to Sarah O. Lee, who passed away in 1824. His second wife was Maria Knox Innes, who died in 1851. His third wife was Elizabeth Moss. He had at least eight children that survived to adulthood (six of whom with his first wife). Crittenden is buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94745P0'>Judah Philip Benjamin was a U.S senator from Louisiana and then a high ranking official in the Confederate government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P1'>Born to Jewish parents from London, England, on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, on August 6, 1811, Benjamin moved with his family as a child to Charleston, South Carolina. He briefly attended Yale College, but left before graduating, and moved to New Orleans where he studied law and became a practicing attorney. Benjamin entered politics in the 1840s, eventually being elected to the U.S. Senate for Louisiana in 1852. He was the first Jewish U.S. senator. He resigned his seat when Louisiana declared its secession from the Union in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, and returned to New Orleans. Soon afterwards, he received an appointment as attorney general of the Confederate government. President Jefferson Davis was so impressed with Benjamin’s abilities that he appointed him secretary of war in November 1861. Only five months later, Benjamin received another promotion, this time to secretary of state for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P2'>Benjamin served as secretary of state from March 1862 until the end of the war. He unsuccessfully labored to gain European recognition of the Confederacy, and during the final months of the war endorsed a last-ditch proposal to accept African Americans into Confederate military service. He fled the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, with Jefferson Davis in 1865, but separated from the group during their journey into the deep south to flee Union pursuers. Benjamin successfully escaped North American on a ship and sailed to Great Britain. He lived there for the rest of his life, successfully practicing law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P3'>Benjamin was married to Natalie Bauché de St. Martin, a French-speaking Catholic from Louisiana. The couple had one child before experiencing marital strife, and Natalie had moved with their daughter to Paris in the 1840s. Benjamin periodically visited his daughter, but his efforts to reconcile with Natalie were unsuccessful.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P4'>Benjamin retired in 1883, partly due to health problems. He died in Paris on May 6, 1884. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
