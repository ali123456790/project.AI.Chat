                    <p xml:id='OTPS76776P0'>Samuel Gibbs French was a northern-born general of the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P1'>Born near Mullica Hill, New Jersey, on November 28, 1818, French was raised in the north and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating from West Point in 1843, he was placed with the Third United States Artillery and served at posts in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. During the Mexican-American War, French performed well in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, and Monterrey, receiving the brevet (honorary) rank of first lieutenant for his actions. In February 1847, he was wounded during the Battle of Buena Vista, but remained on the field during the fighting. Following the battle, he received the brevet rank of captain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P2'>After recuperating in New Jersey from his wound, French was appointed assistant quartermaster in the general staff of the army. By 1849 he was able to resume field operations and carried out assignments in Texas and Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1853 he married Eliza Matilda Roberts of Mississippi. The couple had one daughter. Through his wife's family, French received a plantation near Greenville, Mississippi. In 1856, he resigned from the army to manage the property. The following year, Eliza passed away.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P3'>Following Mississippi’s secession in January 1861, French offered to support his adopted state and the Confederacy. He received a commission as a lieutenant colonel and chief of ordnance in the Army of Mississippi in February 1861. News of his support of the Confederacy reportedly sparked furor in New Jersey, leading to protestors ransacking French’s summer home in Woodbury and burning him in effigy. In October 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate Army and received an assignment to oversee the defense of the Potomac River in Virginia. For much of 1862 and 1863, French led efforts to create and improve defensive works in Virginia and North Carolina, including Fort Fisher (which was the among the Confederacy’s most elaborate defensive positions) and Petersburg (whose earthworks frustrated Union assaults for several months in 1864). French also led troops in the field, participating in fighting at Harrison’s Landing in July 1862 and Suffolk, Virginia, in September 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P4'>In 1863 French was transferred to the western theater, where he commanded a division under General Joseph E. Johnston during the unsuccessful effort to relieve Confederate troops besieged at Vicksburg, Mississippi. French continued to serve in the Mississippi area in late 1863 and early 1864, before being transferred to the Army of Tennessee in May 1864 to aid in the defense of Atlanta against William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army. He remained in the field, commanding a division during the Confederate advance into Tennessee in the fall of 1864. His soldiers took heavy casualties during the Confederate defeat at Franklin, Tennessee, and French was forced to take medical leave due to an eye infection that nearly left him blind. His last military assignment was the defense of Mobile, Alabama. He and his men held out until April 1865, when they surrendered to Union troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P5'>In 1865, French married Mary Fontaine Abercrombie. The couple had three kids and variously lived in Mississippi, New Jersey, Georgia, and Florida. When the United States entered the Spanish-American War in 1898, the 79-year old French—who had participated in thirty-five battles during the Mexican-American War and Civil War—reportedly volunteered for service. President William McKinley turned down his offer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P6'>French wrote a memoir entitled <hi rend='italic'>Two Wars: An Autobiography of Samuel G. French</hi>, which laid heavy criticism on several Confederate officials, including Mississippi governor John J. Pettus, General William J. Hardee, General John Bell Hood, and General Leonidas Polk. He also remained highly critical of the north, blaming the Civil War on anti-slavery northerners. French died on April 20, 1910, in Alabama while visiting one of his children. He is buried in Saint John’s Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94830P0'>Artillery, also known as cannons, are weapons that fire projectiles for longer ranges than small arms carried by infantry soldiers. The term artillery is also used to describe units, or the branch of service within the army, that operate cannons. During the Civil War, the most common artillery pieces were mounted on wheels and were capable of being transported by horses for deployment in battle. Called “field artillery,” these relatively small cannons were intended to inflict damage on enemy troops and light defensive positions. When mobility was not necessary, such as with fixed fortifications, artillery units used much heavier cannons with greater range and destructive power. Coastal defenses especially relied upon large artillery pieces to guard against heavily armed naval vessels.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P1'>Because the Confederacy did not have the same quantity and quality of manufacturing capabilities as northern states, the Confederate army heavily relied upon captured Union cannons and ammunition to outfit its artillery units. A shortage of guns meant that Confederate artillery batteries (the smallest individual artillery unit) typically consisted of four cannons, often of mixed calibers. This differed from Union batteries which fielded six guns of the same caliber. Shortages also limited Confederate artillery training, leading many people—even in the South—to believe that Confederate artillery capabilities were inferior to those of the Union army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P2'>Initially, Confederate artillery batteries were individually attached to infantry brigades. However, during the latter half of the war, military officials created artillery battalions of three or four batteries each to better combine artillery firepower for infantry divisions. Nevertheless, Confederate artillery officers, such as the chief of artillery for the Army of Northern Virginia Brigadier General William N. Pendleton, found it exceedingly difficult to draw together battalions for mass artillery fire during fast moving and broad battle fronts. (Wikipedia)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD83857P0'>In both the North and the South, women formed as many as 20,000 Ladies Military Aid Societies (also called Soldiers’ Aid Societies) throughout the Civil War. Nearly every town and village had its own version. Organized and run locally by women, these societies supported soldiers by providing food and textile goods, including clothing, socks, tents, and bandages. Within the first month of the war, southern organizations also made cartridges and prepared sandbags. Working with local and state politicians, women also developed transportation networks to move gathered supplies into the field. Some women  even personally transported the supplies through these networks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P1'>Initially, Black women also supported these largely white women’s societies in the North, but the introduction of Black regiments in 1863 led Black women to create their own military aid societies, like the Colored Ladies Soldiers’ Aid Society of St. Louis, Missouri. These groups focused specifically on the needs of Black soldiers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P2'>Over the course of the war, these societies expanded their goals to include aiding soldiers’ families and the local poor, as well as taking on new roles as nurses. In the North, this impulse eventually led to the creation of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, Western Sanitary Commission, and the Central Association for Relief, which were dedicated to the support of sick and wounded U.S. soldiers. Reliant on private donations, these groups organized fundraisers, including social events like concerts, dinners, and dances. This sharpened women’s organizational and political skills, although most women stayed within the traditional domestic sphere.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P3'>Ladies Military Aid Societies continued their operations after the war. In the North, their aims shifted towards veteran and orphan care, including helping families apply for pensions and providing direct aid for disabled soldiers. In the South, in addition to assisting veterans, these societies often became memorial associations, which were active in creating Confederate cemeteries and monuments. (Beverly C. Tomek, “Women and Soldiers’ Aid Societies; Wikipedia; Nina Silber, <hi rend='italic'>Gender &amp; the Sectional Conflict</hi>)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25023922P0'>Jewish people adhere to a monotheistic religion, worshipping one god, who revealed himself primarily to the prophets Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to a number of other prophets throughout history dating back to the ancient Middle East. The Jewish faith encompasses one's entire lifestyle, blending theology, law, and culture, including dietary restrictions limited to certain foods called kosher, all passed down through tradition and proscribed in the Hebrew Bible (Britannica).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25023922P1'>Jewish people have lived in Mississippi since the eighteenth century, but the first Jewish communities developed in the early nineteenth. The Jewish population in Mississippi, while never large, initially consisted of immigrants from Germany and, later in the nineteenth century, eastern Europeans. Many Jewish immigrants from Europe had little or no experience with agriculture, and thus earned their living primarily by business ownership or traveling sales. The Jewish community in Mississippi thereby played a large role in connecting Mississippi's farmers and their produce to larger world markets. Jewish people have faced discrimination throughout their history, including in the United States, the South, and in Mississippi. However, many Jewish people in the nineteenth century faced less discrimination in the South than in urban centers in the North, as many Jewish people embraced the predominant beliefs of southern white culture, leading many to fight for the Confederacy during the American Civil War (Mississippi Encyclopedia).
