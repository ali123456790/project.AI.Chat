                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71951P0'>James Ronald Chalmers was a Confederate officer and served as a U.S. Representative for Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P1'>Born in Halifax County, Virginia, on January 11, 1831, Chalmers moved with his family to Mississippi during his youth, settling in Holly Springs. After graduating from South Carolina College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in Holly Springs in 1853. Five years later, he was elected district attorney. He was selected as a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in 1861, and helped pass the ordinance of secession which declared the state separate from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P2'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, Chalmers volunteered for military service. He was first commissioned as a captain the Confederate army and soon received a promotion to colonel of the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. After commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida, Chalmers was promoted again, to brigadier general. He performed well during the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and again during the Battle of Murfreesboro from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. In 1864, he fought in western Tennessee, including the Battle of Fort Pillow, which involved Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest murdering several African American Union prisoners. In 1865, he was placed in charge of all Mississippi cavalry in the Mississippi and western Tennessee region. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P3'>After the Civil War, Chalmers returned to Mississippi and resumed practicing law. He gained fame among white conservatives through his opposition to Republican Reconstruction, and led an armed group of Democrats to Friar’s Point in 1876 to chase away the sheriff and intimidate African Americans in the area. That same year he won a state senate seat. When Mississippi was readmitted to the Union, Chalmers won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1877 to 1880. Although he again won reelection in 1880, his Republican opponent, John R. Lynch, disputed the election results. A Congressional investigation found in favor for Lynch, but not until 1882 after Chalmers had served most of the term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P4'>Around 1882, Chalmers broke with the traditional Democratic Party in Mississippi. He ran for reelection in 1882, but as an Independent Democrat with support from some Republicans and the Greenback Party (which was a third-party political movement that focused on economic matters). A traditional Democrat candidate, Van H. Manning, won the election, but this time Chalmers contested the results. Congress decided in Chalmer’s favor and he reentered Congress in June 1884, but lost reelection later that fall.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P5'>Chalmers returned to practicing law after the 1884 election. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and died on April 29, 1882. He had been married to Rebecca Arthur; the couple had two children. Chalmers is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS86224P0'>William Wallace Washington Wood was a lawyer, Confederate officer, and newspaper editor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86224P1'>Born in 1824 in Washington, Adams County, Mississippi, Wood was in New Orleans, Louisiana, working as a notary public by 1850. By December 1853, he was a lawyer, practicing in New Orleans through the end of 1854. By 1858, he had relocatd to Natchez, Mississippi, where he and Samuel Wood purchased the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi Free Trader</hi>, which was a newspaper that supported the Democratic Party. The following year, Samuel Wood sold his share in the paper to Campbell Marsh. W. W. W. Wood worked as the newspaper's editor throughout this period until the spring of 1861 when both Wood and Marsh ceased publication in order to join the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86224P2'>During the Civil War, Wood initially served as a Major General of the 1st Division Mississippi Cavalry militia. Around August 1861, he was injured in Virginia and was forced to resign his position. By December 1861, however, he had recovered, and he joined the Confederate Army, serving as Captain of the Tom Weldon Rebels in the 44th Mississippi Infantry.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86224P3'>After the Civil War, Wood returned to Natchez, Adams County, Mississippi, where he resumed work as a lawyer. He was also a deputy clerk and interim newspaper editor for the <hi rend='italic'>Natchez Democrat</hi>. Wood was also involved in the movement of some former Confederates to Brazil. Known as "Confederados" by the Brazilians, approximately 20,000 former Confederates made this journey.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86224P4'>Wood was married to Euphemia P. (Quegles) Wood. The pair had four children, including two boys and one girl who lived to adulthood. William Wallace Washington Wood died on September 21, 1867 and was buried in the Natchez City Cemetery in Natchez, Adams County, Mississippi.

It was reinstated as the capital from 1817 until 1820, when the capital was again replaced by Washington (which was later replaced by the current capital Jackson in 1822).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests. (Tracy L. Barnett, “Mississippi ‘Milish’: Militiamen in the Civil War,” <hi rend='italic'>Civil War History</hi>, Vol. 66, No. 4 (Dec 2020), 343-379; Michael B. Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD78266P0'>Shortly after declaring the state of Mississippi separated from the United States in January 1861, its secession convention passed an order entitled “An Ordinance to Regulate the Military System of the State of Mississippi.” This ordinance created a Military Board to oversee Mississippi’s military personnel and resources. This board was to be made up of four brigadier generals and a major general in charge of the state’s militia, and the governor. On January 23, the convention elected the board members as Jefferson Davis (as major general) and Earl Van Dorn, Charles Clark, James L. Alcorn, and Christopher H. Mott (as brigadier generals). Shortly thereafter, the Military Board met to build and prepare Mississippi’s armed forces. It appointed Richard Griffith to the position of adjutant general, Samuel G. French to oversee the ordnance requirements, and William Barksdale for the quartermaster general. With appointments complete, the board then published instructions for Mississippi’s military structure, procedures, tactics, and equipment in the form of <hi rend='italic'>Orders of the Military Board of the State of Mississippi</hi>. Over the next several weeks, the board handled a wide variety of strategic and administrative tasks, such as planning the defense of Mississippi’s coastline and facilitating the purchase of rations and weapons for Mississippi troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD78266P1'>Although the Military Board began well, it soon ran into problems. Many of its members vacated their positions for promotions into Confederate service. Davis was elected president of the Confederacy, and the brigadier generals took military positions within the Confederate army. Mississippi officials appointed new generals to take their place on the Military Board, but the governor’s dislike of Alcorn caused controversy and led to another individual—Reuben Davis—being promoted to major general. Additional problems arose when most of Mississippi ‘s troops and equipment were transferred into Confederate service. Continued enlistments into that army prevented the state’s militia force from maintaining a steady number or presence. The Military Board spent much of its time during the summer of 1861 trying to procure sufficient weapons and soldiers for state service. By the fall, Mississippi officials believed that the Military Board was an inefficient method of governing the militia. The board was discontinued in November 1861. (Timothy B. Smith, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi in the Civil War</hi>, 52–60)
