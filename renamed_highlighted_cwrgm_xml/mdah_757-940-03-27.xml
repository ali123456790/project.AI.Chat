                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS84072P0'>Absolom Madden West was a Confederate general, a Mississippi politician, railroad executive, and vice presidential candidate. Born in Alabama in 1818, West moved to Mississippi around 1837 to establish a plantation with property he acquired from federal land grants. He entered Mississippi state politics as a Whig and won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1847. He married Caroline O. Glover in the 1840s and the couple had four surviving children, born between 1849 and 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P1'>In 1853, he took an office job with the new Mississippi Central Railroad, gaining experience not only in railroad development but corporate and logistical operations. As a Whig, West originally opposed secession. However, after Mississippi left the Union in 1861, during the secession crisis that split the country following Abraham Lincon’s election to president in November 1860, West offered his loyalty and services to the state. He was promoted a brigadier general in the Mississippi state militia, and helped raised a regiment of volunteers. Recognizing his skill and experience in administrative and logistical work, state officials appointed him to several different managerial roles, such as quartermaster general, paymaster general, and commissary general of the militia. He made recommendations to the state legislature to improve the accounting of funds, and was the only state officer to have his accounting books in order and submitted at the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P2'>West took the role of president over the Mississippi Central Railroad around 1864. He remained in that position until around the end of the war, then returned to state politics—again serving in the Mississippi Senate—after the Illinois Central purchased the Mississippi Central. West was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the early effort by the Mississippi government in 1865 to earn readmission to the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, he was among the Mississippi delegation refused seats in Congress when Republicans in Washington, D.C., objected to Mississippi’s “Black Codes”—a series of highly discriminatory laws passed in the summer of 1865 to restrict the civil rights of African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P3'>West became involved in labor rights during Reconstruction, helping form a branch of the National Labor Union. Reentering the Mississippi Senate in the early 1870s, around 1876 he broke away from the Democratic Party and joined the emerging “Greenback Party”—an independent, anti-monopoly political party. It united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters, namely the expansion of paper currency believed to help farmers and small businesses. Attesting to the party’s ability to bring former enemies together, the party’s national convention in 1884 nominated former Union general Benjamin Butler (who had been despised within the Confederacy during his occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War) for its presidential candidate and the former Confederate militia general West as vice president. The party polled only a 1.7% of the popular vote in 1884.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P4'>West’s wife Caroline died in 1889 after a long bout of poor health. He died five years later, in 1894.  The couple is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25015362P0'>The Army of 10,000, Alcorn’s Brigade (Confederate) was organized in November and December of 1861 at Grenada, Yalobusha County (present-day Grenada County), Mississippi under the command of Brig. Gen. James L. Alcorn and served in the Western Theater. It consisted of three infantry regiments and one cavalry company. It was one of two brigades raised under Governor John J. Pettus’s call for volunteers for sixty days’ service to support Confederate operations in Kentucky and Tennessee. It was disbanded in February of 1862.
