                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63404P0'>Thomas Overton Moore was governor of Louisiana during most of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P1'>Born on April 10, 1804, in Sampson County, North Carolina, Moore moved to Louisiana at the age of 25 to manage his uncle’s cotton plantation. He eventually purchased his own property and established a financially successful plantation. By the late 1840s he was involved in politics, winning a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1848 and the state’s Senate in 1856. He served as chairman of the state’s Education Committee and helped establish Louisiana State Seminary (modern-day Louisiana State University), with future Union general William Tecumseh Sherman as the school’s first superintendent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P2'>In 1859 Moore won election as Louisiana’s governor, taking office in January 1860. As governor, he spoke strongly against northern anti-slavery sentiments and vehemently opposed Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860. In January 1861, Moore ordered the state’s militia to seize U.S. military posts within the Louisiana, before state formally declared its secession from the Union. After Louisiana joined the Confederacy in March 1861, Moore called for Confederate support to defend New Orleans. As he feared, Union naval and ground forces advanced against the port city early in the war, securing in April 1862, and forcing the state’s government to move out of Baton Rouge for central Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P3'>Moore remained governor until 1864, most of his time in office seeing Union forces hold key parts of Louisiana. He returned to his plantation but was forced to leave when Union soldiers under General Nathaniel P. Banks raided his property during the Red River Campaign in the spring of 1864. Moore fled to Mexico and then Cuba rather than surrender to Union forces in 1865. From Havana, he applied to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon—the request being delivered by General William Tecumseh Sherman personally. Johnson pardoned Moore in 1867, and Moore returned to Louisiana. He regained his lost property, again aided by Sherman, but never returned to political office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P4'>Moore was married to Bethiah Johnston Leonard and had five children. He died on June 25, 1876, near Alexandria, Louisiana. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Pineville, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS76776P0'>Samuel Gibbs French was a northern-born general of the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P1'>Born near Mullica Hill, New Jersey, on November 28, 1818, French was raised in the north and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating from West Point in 1843, he was placed with the Third United States Artillery and served at posts in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. During the Mexican-American War, French performed well in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, and Monterrey, receiving the brevet (honorary) rank of first lieutenant for his actions. In February 1847, he was wounded during the Battle of Buena Vista, but remained on the field during the fighting. Following the battle, he received the brevet rank of captain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P2'>After recuperating in New Jersey from his wound, French was appointed assistant quartermaster in the general staff of the army. By 1849 he was able to resume field operations and carried out assignments in Texas and Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1853 he married Eliza Matilda Roberts of Mississippi. The couple had one daughter. Through his wife's family, French received a plantation near Greenville, Mississippi. In 1856, he resigned from the army to manage the property. The following year, Eliza passed away.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P3'>Following Mississippi’s secession in January 1861, French offered to support his adopted state and the Confederacy. He received a commission as a lieutenant colonel and chief of ordnance in the Army of Mississippi in February 1861. News of his support of the Confederacy reportedly sparked furor in New Jersey, leading to protestors ransacking French’s summer home in Woodbury and burning him in effigy. In October 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate Army and received an assignment to oversee the defense of the Potomac River in Virginia. For much of 1862 and 1863, French led efforts to create and improve defensive works in Virginia and North Carolina, including Fort Fisher (which was the among the Confederacy’s most elaborate defensive positions) and Petersburg (whose earthworks frustrated Union assaults for several months in 1864). French also led troops in the field, participating in fighting at Harrison’s Landing in July 1862 and Suffolk, Virginia, in September 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P4'>In 1863 French was transferred to the western theater, where he commanded a division under General Joseph E. Johnston during the unsuccessful effort to relieve Confederate troops besieged at Vicksburg, Mississippi. French continued to serve in the Mississippi area in late 1863 and early 1864, before being transferred to the Army of Tennessee in May 1864 to aid in the defense of Atlanta against William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army. He remained in the field, commanding a division during the Confederate advance into Tennessee in the fall of 1864. His soldiers took heavy casualties during the Confederate defeat at Franklin, Tennessee, and French was forced to take medical leave due to an eye infection that nearly left him blind. His last military assignment was the defense of Mobile, Alabama. He and his men held out until April 1865, when they surrendered to Union troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P5'>In 1865, French married Mary Fontaine Abercrombie. The couple had three kids and variously lived in Mississippi, New Jersey, Georgia, and Florida. When the United States entered the Spanish-American War in 1898, the 79-year old French—who had participated in thirty-five battles during the Mexican-American War and Civil War—reportedly volunteered for service. President William McKinley turned down his offer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76776P6'>French wrote a memoir entitled <hi rend='italic'>Two Wars: An Autobiography of Samuel G. French</hi>, which laid heavy criticism on several Confederate officials, including Mississippi governor John J. Pettus, General William J. Hardee, General John Bell Hood, and General Leonidas Polk. He also remained highly critical of the north, blaming the Civil War on anti-slavery northerners. French died on April 20, 1910, in Alabama while visiting one of his children. He is buried in Saint John’s Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida.

It became the capital of French Louisiana in 1722 and continued as the capital when Louisiana achieved statehood on April 30, 1812. It became part of Orleans County (now extinct) on the same day. In 1849 it was replaced by Baton Rouge as the state capital, although it temporarily served as the capital again from 1865 until 1880. (Wikipedia; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of Southern History</hi>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
