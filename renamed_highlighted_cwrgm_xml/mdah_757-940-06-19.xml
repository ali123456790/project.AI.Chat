                    <p xml:id='OTPS63179P0'>Andrew Barry Moore served as governor of Alabama on the eve of the Civil War. Born on March 7, 1807, in the Spartanburg District of South Carolina. He moved to Perry County, Alabama, in 1826, and initially became a teacher. A short time later, however, he began studying law and in 1833 became a practicing attorney. Almost immediately he pursued public office, serving as the Justice of the Peace for Perry County and then, in 1839, winning a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives as a Democrat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63179P1'>Moore served in the Alabama legislature until 1846, at which point he returned to his law practice. He remained active in Democratic circles, serving as a presidential elector for Lewis. Cass’s unsuccessful Democratic run for president in 1848. In 1851, Moore received an appointment by to the First Circuit Court. He spent six years on the bench until he was elected governor of Alabama in 1857. As governor, Moore advocated the improvement of state hospitals, including facilities for blind and deaf patients, as well as those with psychiatric conditions He also labored to expand railroad development in Alabama.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63179P2'>Moore was strongly pro-slavery, but a moderate on the sectional conflict during the late 1850s. As calls for disunion grew across the south, Moore believed that separation from the Union was not wise for Alabama. However, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860, Moore adopted a more radical stance and supported Alabama’s secession convention in early 1861. In preparation for that secession, Moore ordered state military forces to capture U.S. Army facilities around Alabama, particularly those guarding Mobile harbor. He also sent Alabama militia forces to Florida to aid secessionists there seize U.S. installations at Pensacola.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63179P3'>Moore time as governor ended in December 1861. He took an appointment as a special aid to the new governor John Gill Shorter, and continued to support the Confederate war effort by procuring and organizing supplies and soldiers. When the Civil War ended, Moore was arrested by federal authorities and temporarily imprisoned at Fort Pulaski, Georgia. After his release, he returned to Alabama and practiced law. He passed away on April 5, 1873, at the age of 66. Moore was married to Mary Goree and had two children. He is buried in Fairview Cemetery in Marion, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.
