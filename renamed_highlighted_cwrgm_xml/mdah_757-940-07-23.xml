                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94745P0'>Judah Philip Benjamin was a U.S senator from Louisiana and then a high ranking official in the Confederate government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P1'>Born to Jewish parents from London, England, on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, on August 6, 1811, Benjamin moved with his family as a child to Charleston, South Carolina. He briefly attended Yale College, but left before graduating, and moved to New Orleans where he studied law and became a practicing attorney. Benjamin entered politics in the 1840s, eventually being elected to the U.S. Senate for Louisiana in 1852. He was the first Jewish U.S. senator. He resigned his seat when Louisiana declared its secession from the Union in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, and returned to New Orleans. Soon afterwards, he received an appointment as attorney general of the Confederate government. President Jefferson Davis was so impressed with Benjamin’s abilities that he appointed him secretary of war in November 1861. Only five months later, Benjamin received another promotion, this time to secretary of state for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P2'>Benjamin served as secretary of state from March 1862 until the end of the war. He unsuccessfully labored to gain European recognition of the Confederacy, and during the final months of the war endorsed a last-ditch proposal to accept African Americans into Confederate military service. He fled the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, with Jefferson Davis in 1865, but separated from the group during their journey into the deep south to flee Union pursuers. Benjamin successfully escaped North American on a ship and sailed to Great Britain. He lived there for the rest of his life, successfully practicing law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P3'>Benjamin was married to Natalie Bauché de St. Martin, a French-speaking Catholic from Louisiana. The couple had one child before experiencing marital strife, and Natalie had moved with their daughter to Paris in the 1840s. Benjamin periodically visited his daughter, but his efforts to reconcile with Natalie were unsuccessful.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P4'>Benjamin retired in 1883, partly due to health problems. He died in Paris on May 6, 1884. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94689P0'>William F. Dowd was a prominent Mississippi attorney who served as a Confederate officer during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94689P1'>Born at Society Hill, South Carolina, on December 31, 1820, Dowd moved as a child with his parents to Tennessee. He moved to Mississippi in 1841 and began to study law. He became a practicing attorney in 1846 and soon joined the firm of Coopwood, Herbert &amp; Dowd in Aberdeen, Mississippi. His found tremendous success through is legal career, becoming one of the wealthiest attorneys in the state. Dowd’s income in 1854 was estimated to be $20,000—more nearly $700,000 in modern figures. His fame as an attorney and public speaker naturally led him to politics, and he became editor of a pro-Whig Party newspaper in Aberdeen in the 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94689P2'>Dowd strongly supported Mississippi’s right to secession, and when the Civil War broke out in 1861, he helped raise a regiment of volunteers, later accepted into Confederate service as the Twenty-fourth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He was elected colonel in command of the unit and led it through numerous battles, including Corinth, Perryville, Lookout Mountain, and Missionary Ridge. He resigned from command late in the war due to health problems and accepted an appointment as a military judge in northern Alabama.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94689P3'>After the Civil War, Dowd returned to practicing law in Mississippi until he passed away on November 28, 1872, in Aberdeen. He was married to Ann W. Brown and had at least three children that survived to adulthood. Dowd is buried at Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.
