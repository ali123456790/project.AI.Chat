                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25008799P0'>Edmund Winston Pettus was an attorney and politician from Alabama who served as a Confederate officer and then a leader of the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25008799P1'>Born on July 6, 1821, in Athens, Alabama, Pettus graduated from Clinton College in Tennessee before studying law and becoming a practicing attorney in Alabama in 1842. Two years later, he was elected solicitor of the seventh judicial circuit in Alabama. Pettus volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, and served as a lieutenant with an Alabama unit. Following the war, he briefly lived in California before returning to Alabama in 1853. He took up his old position as a solicitor and then received an appointment as circuit judge in 1855. After three years on the bench, Pettus moved to the town of Cahaba and practiced law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25008799P2'>Following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Pettus strongly supported southern secession. Although a resident of Alabama, he attended Mississippi’s secession convention, in part because his brother John J. Pettus was Mississippi’s governor. He then volunteered for Confederate service and helped raise the Twentieth Alabama Infantry Regiment. Commissioned as its major, he later rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and helped lead the regiment through several engagements. He was captured during the Battle of Stones River (or Murfreesboro) in late December 1862, but was later released as part of the prisoner exchange program. Pettus was captured against during fighting at Port Gibson, Mississippi, in early 1863. He escaped and returned to his regiment, where he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of his regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25008799P3'>Pettus was captured a third time when Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army defeated the Confederate army defending Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 4, 1863. He was exchanged, again, two months later, and was again promoted, this time to brigadier general. He commanded a brigade, and temporarily led a division, in the Army of Tennessee and participated in battles around Chattanooga and the Atlanta Campaign in 1864. He continued to fight in the Carolinas in 1865 and was wounded in the right leg during the battle of Bentonville, North Carolina. Captured a final time, Pettus was paroled by Union forces in early May 1865, after the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25008799P4'>Pettus returned to Alabama to practice law after the Civil War. He entered politics as part of the Democratic Party in opposition to federal Reconstruction. More significantly, he joined the Ku Klux Klan—a secretive organization that emerged in the south to terrorize Republicans and African Americans in order to reestablish white supremacy and Democratic political dominance. In 1877, he became the Grand Dragon of the Klan in Alabama.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25008799P5'>At 75 years old, in 1896, Pettus won election for the U.S. Senate from Alabama. He leveraged his history as a defender of the Old South and white supremacy to secure the necessary support from the white conservative Alabama legislature to defeat the incumbent candidate. Pettus served in the Senate from 1897 until his death on July 27, 1907. He was married to Mary Chapman and had at least four children. He is buried in Live Oak Cemetery in Selma, Alabama.

On February 8, 1818, Moore's Bluff became part of the newly created Dallas County. It was renamed Selma on December 4, 1820, when it was incorporated. Selma became the county seat in 1866.
