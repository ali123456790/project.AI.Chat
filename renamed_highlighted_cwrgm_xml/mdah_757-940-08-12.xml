                    <p xml:id='OTPS94745P0'>Judah Philip Benjamin was a U.S senator from Louisiana and then a high ranking official in the Confederate government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P1'>Born to Jewish parents from London, England, on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, on August 6, 1811, Benjamin moved with his family as a child to Charleston, South Carolina. He briefly attended Yale College, but left before graduating, and moved to New Orleans where he studied law and became a practicing attorney. Benjamin entered politics in the 1840s, eventually being elected to the U.S. Senate for Louisiana in 1852. He was the first Jewish U.S. senator. He resigned his seat when Louisiana declared its secession from the Union in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, and returned to New Orleans. Soon afterwards, he received an appointment as attorney general of the Confederate government. President Jefferson Davis was so impressed with Benjamin’s abilities that he appointed him secretary of war in November 1861. Only five months later, Benjamin received another promotion, this time to secretary of state for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P2'>Benjamin served as secretary of state from March 1862 until the end of the war. He unsuccessfully labored to gain European recognition of the Confederacy, and during the final months of the war endorsed a last-ditch proposal to accept African Americans into Confederate military service. He fled the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, with Jefferson Davis in 1865, but separated from the group during their journey into the deep south to flee Union pursuers. Benjamin successfully escaped North American on a ship and sailed to Great Britain. He lived there for the rest of his life, successfully practicing law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P3'>Benjamin was married to Natalie Bauché de St. Martin, a French-speaking Catholic from Louisiana. The couple had one child before experiencing marital strife, and Natalie had moved with their daughter to Paris in the 1840s. Benjamin periodically visited his daughter, but his efforts to reconcile with Natalie were unsuccessful.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P4'>Benjamin retired in 1883, partly due to health problems. He died in Paris on May 6, 1884. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS101380P0'>Edward Fontaine was an attorney, minister, and Confederate officer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P1'>Born on August 5, 1814, in Greenwood, Virginia, Fontaine was the great grandson of notable American Revolutionary War figure Patrick Henry. He initially pursued a military education at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was expelled after two years, in 1832, due to poor math scores. Fontaine then pursued an education in law and became a practicing attorney in 1835. That same year he traveled to Mississippi and worked on a team that surveyed lands recently acquired by the federal government from the Chickasaw tribe.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P2'>In 1838, Fontaine became a Methodist Episcopal minister. He moved to Texas to work as a preacher, off and on, until the early 1840s. While in Texas he participated in the Somervell expedition, which was a brief military campaign into Mexico in 1842 as part of a simmering dispute between that country and the Republic of Texas. The next year, Fontaine left Texas for Mississippi and in 1848 became a minister in the Episcopal church. He then returned to Texas in 1851 and oversaw the construction of St. David’s Church in Austin and became the chaplain of the Texas Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P3'>Fontaine left Texas again, in 1859, and returned to Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Confederate service. He became captain of Company H, Eighteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and later was appointed chief of ordnance of the Mississippi Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P4'>After the war, Fontaine served as a rector at churches in Mississippi and Louisiana. He also became a strong promoter of historical study and natural sciences, gaining membership in several scientific organizations, such as the New York Historical Society, the New Orleans academy of Science, and the Maryland Academy of Science. He presented papers and speeches on the natural history of Texas, based upon his observations traveling the state, and the terrain and geography of the Mississippi River area.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P5'>Fontaine died on January 19, 1884. He was married twice. His first wife was Mary Ann Swisher, who passed away in 1855. In 1859 he married Susan Taylor. Fontaine had at least four children. He is buried at the Belvedere-Sub Rosa Plantation in Pocahontas, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of Southern History</hi>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
