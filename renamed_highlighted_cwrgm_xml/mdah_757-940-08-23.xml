                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71223P0'>Alexander Hamilton Handy was an attorney and chief justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court in the 1860s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71223P1'>Born on December 25, 1809, in Somerset County, Maryland, Handy attended Washington Academy in Maine and studied law. After becoming a practicing attorney in 1834, he moved to Mississippi in 1836 and set up a successful legal practice. Handy was elected justice in Mississippi’s High Court of Errors and Appeals (the precursor to the state’s supreme court) in 1853, and remained in that position for nearly fifteen years.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71223P2'>Handy was an outspoken defender of slavery and secessionism during the sectional conflict that led to the Civil War. In January 1861, he served as a commissioner from Mississippi to his birth state of Maryland, where he warned that the election of Abraham Lincoln and the anti-slavery Republican Party was a subversion of southern rights within the constitutional union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71223P3'>Handy remained on the Mississippi Supreme Court through the Civil War.  He served as chief justice from 1864 until 1867, when he resigned from the high court in protest of federal Reconstruction policies. He left Mississippi and moved back to Maryland, where he practiced law. He also taught at the University of Maryland Law School for a short period of time.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71223P4'>In 1871, Handy returned to Mississippi. He died on September 12, 1883. He was married to Susan Wilson Stuart and had at least five children. Handy is buried in Canton City Cemetery in Canton, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS68611P0'>William Littleton Harris was a legal expert and judge in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P1'>Born on July 6, 1807, in Elbert County, Georgia, Harris proved an exceptionally fast learner and graduated from the University of Georgia at the age of fifteen. He studied law and applied to be admitted as a practicing attorney as a minor. The state legislature had to pass a law to authorize him admission to the bar due to his youthful age.  In 1837, Harris moved to Mississippi and began a very successful law office. He became a circuit judge in 1853 and helped author the Mississippi Code of 1857. In 1858, Harris received an appointment to the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeal (currently the state’s supreme court) and proved to be a fiercely strong supporter of slavery and white supremacy. In 1859, he wrote the court’s opinion in <hi rend='italic'>Mitchell v. Wells</hi>, which rejected a former slave’s right to inherit property from her white father. The court’s decision concluded that African Americans were not citizens, as citizenship was reserved for white people.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P2'>In 1860, Harris received an offer to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court by President James Buchanan. He turned down the appointment due to growing political tension over slavery and his expectation that the south would secede from the Union. Instead, Harris accepted an appointment from Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, to serve as a secession commissioner to Georgia. He spoke before the Georgia General Assembly, calling for the south's separation from the Union in order to prevent northerners from ending slavery in the south and extending civil rights to African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P3'>During the Civil War, Harris served as a circuit court judge in Mississippi. Following the war, he received an appointment to serve again on the state’s High Court of Errors and Appeals, but was blocked by President Andrew Johnson. Harris left Mississippi in 1867 and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he began a law practice with two other attorneys. He passed away on November 27, 1868, from complications of pneumonia. Harris was married to Frances Semmes and had six children. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS96449P1'>Born on August 17, 1820, in Edgefield District, South Carolina, Hudson moved to Mississippi as a young man and became a leading legal figure in the state. He served as a district attorney and was a circuit judge in Mississippi during the Civil War. After the war, Hudson was prominent in efforts to restrict legal rights for African Americans, participating in Mississippi’s constitutional convention in 1865 and chairing the committee in that convention that outlined the highly discriminatory laws later known as the Black Codes. He briefly served in the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1875 and was chairman of the Committee on Impeachment during the Democratic effort to expel Republican Governor Adelbert Ames from office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS96449P2'>Hudson died on May 29, 1889, at the age of 68. He was married to Nancy Elvira Gray and had at least seven children that survived to adulthood. Hudson is buried in Glenwood Cemetery in Yazoo City, Mississippi.
