                    <p xml:id='OTPS101380P0'>Edward Fontaine was an attorney, minister, and Confederate officer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P1'>Born on August 5, 1814, in Greenwood, Virginia, Fontaine was the great grandson of notable American Revolutionary War figure Patrick Henry. He initially pursued a military education at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was expelled after two years, in 1832, due to poor math scores. Fontaine then pursued an education in law and became a practicing attorney in 1835. That same year he traveled to Mississippi and worked on a team that surveyed lands recently acquired by the federal government from the Chickasaw tribe.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P2'>In 1838, Fontaine became a Methodist Episcopal minister. He moved to Texas to work as a preacher, off and on, until the early 1840s. While in Texas he participated in the Somervell expedition, which was a brief military campaign into Mexico in 1842 as part of a simmering dispute between that country and the Republic of Texas. The next year, Fontaine left Texas for Mississippi and in 1848 became a minister in the Episcopal church. He then returned to Texas in 1851 and oversaw the construction of St. David’s Church in Austin and became the chaplain of the Texas Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P3'>Fontaine left Texas again, in 1859, and returned to Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Confederate service. He became captain of Company H, Eighteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and later was appointed chief of ordnance of the Mississippi Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P4'>After the war, Fontaine served as a rector at churches in Mississippi and Louisiana. He also became a strong promoter of historical study and natural sciences, gaining membership in several scientific organizations, such as the New York Historical Society, the New Orleans academy of Science, and the Maryland Academy of Science. He presented papers and speeches on the natural history of Texas, based upon his observations traveling the state, and the terrain and geography of the Mississippi River area.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P5'>Fontaine died on January 19, 1884. He was married twice. His first wife was Mary Ann Swisher, who passed away in 1855. In 1859 he married Susan Taylor. Fontaine had at least four children. He is buried at the Belvedere-Sub Rosa Plantation in Pocahontas, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD86078P0'>Insurrection is an organized attempt by a group of people to overthrow a government, usually by violence. The cause, participants, and size of an effort to overthrow authority can vary. However, political and military officials typically respond to insurrections with legal and military force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P1'>The United States Constitution refers to insurrection in Article 1, Section 8, where it authorizes Congress to “provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.” Southern secession activities were not called insurrectionary until Confederates fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, turning the tense political debate over the legality of unilateral state secession into open warfare. At that point, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to enforce federal authority in the South and described the seceded states as engaging in insurrection. The term carries important legal connotations. International law does not recognize insurrectionists as legal combatants in war. By late 1861, Lincoln preferred to describe the South as in a state of “rebellion” instead of insurrection—a term with the same technical meaning, but which more strongly characterized the Confederacy as engaging in an unjust resistance to authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P2'>Confederates also feared political insurrection within the South during Civil War. Support for secession was not universal through the Southern states, and numerous communities—particularly in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, northern Alabama, and most famously western Virginia (which actually separated and created its own state of West Virginia in 1863)—harbored pro-Union sentiments. Confederate and secessionist state officials frequently described anti-Confederate resistance within these communities and other parts of the South as insurrectionary. They used state and Confederate military forces to suppress such opposition.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P3'>Nineteenth century Southerners most commonly used the term insurrection to describe physical resistance by slaves against their masters. When the Union Army began to employ African American soldiers in 1863, the Confederate government announced that white Union officers captured while commanding black soldiers would be executed for inciting “servile insurrection.” The Confederacy backed down from that threat when Lincoln’s administration responded that it would execute one Confederate prisoner for each Union soldier killed, but the policy reflected the long-standing Southern fear of slave insurrections or rebellions. Before, during, and even after the Civil War, white Southern officials called out local militias—or even unregulated groups of armed men—to reestablish authority over African Americans suspected or accused of insurrection, often with overly violent methods. (Gaines M. Foster, “What’s Not in a Name: The Naming of the American Civil War,” <hi rend='italic'>Journal of the Civil War Era</hi>, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Sept 2018), 417-419; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94830P0'>Artillery, also known as cannons, are weapons that fire projectiles for longer ranges than small arms carried by infantry soldiers. The term artillery is also used to describe units, or the branch of service within the army, that operate cannons. During the Civil War, the most common artillery pieces were mounted on wheels and were capable of being transported by horses for deployment in battle. Called “field artillery,” these relatively small cannons were intended to inflict damage on enemy troops and light defensive positions. When mobility was not necessary, such as with fixed fortifications, artillery units used much heavier cannons with greater range and destructive power. Coastal defenses especially relied upon large artillery pieces to guard against heavily armed naval vessels.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P1'>Because the Confederacy did not have the same quantity and quality of manufacturing capabilities as northern states, the Confederate army heavily relied upon captured Union cannons and ammunition to outfit its artillery units. A shortage of guns meant that Confederate artillery batteries (the smallest individual artillery unit) typically consisted of four cannons, often of mixed calibers. This differed from Union batteries which fielded six guns of the same caliber. Shortages also limited Confederate artillery training, leading many people—even in the South—to believe that Confederate artillery capabilities were inferior to those of the Union army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P2'>Initially, Confederate artillery batteries were individually attached to infantry brigades. However, during the latter half of the war, military officials created artillery battalions of three or four batteries each to better combine artillery firepower for infantry divisions. Nevertheless, Confederate artillery officers, such as the chief of artillery for the Army of Northern Virginia Brigadier General William N. Pendleton, found it exceedingly difficult to draw together battalions for mass artillery fire during fast moving and broad battle fronts. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77526P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77526P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, you will find specific references under this subject tag at CWRGM employed the term home guard rather than militia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77526P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77526P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of Southern History</hi>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

<p corresp='TTP1747399P3' xml:id='OTP1747399P3'>Dear Sir.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1747399P4' xml:id='OTP1747399P4'>I have just finished an examination of all the points about <rs ref='#S51788'>Vicksburg</rs>, necessary to be fortified to make it impregnable against an attack by land and water; and to make the <rs ref='#S63143'>River</rs> impassa-ble to the Enemy's boats; and I have made a rude estimate of the cost to the State of one fort. to mount 5—42 pounders, &amp; 4—24 pounders, &amp; which has been already commenced.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1747399P5' xml:id='OTP1747399P5'>But after a careful recon-naissance of the topography of Vicksburg, I feel it my duty to recommend that no further work be done upon the fortifications there than what is necessary for their preservation, &amp; the safe keeping of our ordnance stores; for the following reasons:
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1747399P6' xml:id='OTP1747399P6'>1<add place='above'>st</add> If we fortify Vicksburg, it must be on a scale sufficient to resist a heavier attack than one which could not be resisted by the defences of <rs ref='#S51804'>Columbus</rs>, &amp; <rs ref='#S63147'>Memphis</rs>.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1747399P7' xml:id='OTP1747399P7'>2<add place='above'>d</add>. To do this the cooperation of <rs ref='#S63020'>Louisiana</rs> is

        <fw type="pageNum">Page 2</fw>
          <p corresp='TTP1747400P0' xml:id='OTP1747400P0'>absolutely necessary; or the Confederate States must assume the control of the work. As the <rs ref='#S63134'>yazoo River</rs> is at all times navigable for boats of light draught, and often for those of the largest size for a considerable distance above Vicksburg, and as excellent artillery roads lead to it from the Huffs on its left bank, making a land attack on the north of the City, &amp; an approach to the Southern R. Road entirely practicable, the first point necessary to be fortified is above the mouth of that River. The place is called "Young's point." Strong earthworks &amp; bomb-proof batteries, with a heavy force on both banks of the river are necessary there, with obstructions between them.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1747400P1' xml:id='OTP1747400P1'>The next points to be fortified are the first bluff of the Yazoo River &amp; it opposite bank. The next is the great bend next to Vicksburg, &amp; above it, but South West from the city. The R. Road passes through the narrow neck, separating the Rivers above &amp; below. Which neck the enemy can occupy, &amp; use the R. Road for penetrating the interior of Louisiana, or for running a battery in front of Vicksburg; or they can cut a  canal through the neck, and turn the river through it, and pass by Vicksburg with their flotilla. If a <rs ref='#S71946'>Fort</rs> is not erected there to prevent this, in ascending from it to the next bend North of the City, with rifled cannon they can strike it from their gunboats across the wooded peninsula &amp; the River. The Mississippi opposite Vicksburg is only eleven hundred yards wide, &amp; the peninsula is not more than a mile across.—The water battery commenced above the city is well situated to command the bend of the River; but the fire of long range guns mounted upon it would be rendered ineffectual for more than a mile and a half by a heavy body of timber on the Louisiana side, which conceals &amp; shelters the approach of steam-boats descending from the South West to the North East. The remains of an old Spanish Fort occupy the hill above our water battery; &amp; which commands the City, and two roads approaching it from the Yazoo, and the river and all the country around within the range of shot and shell. It is necessary to fortify this important position for this reason, &amp; to protect the battery at its base.

<p corresp='TTP1747401P1' xml:id='OTP1747401P1'>A beautiful streamlet winds around its northern side, &amp; makes a cascade over a ledge of cretaceous rock rear the North East angle of the water battery. This waterfall makes a fine pool for bathing, under a shower bath; &amp; the water is clear &amp; cool. The Southern bank of the stream is a precipice of fifteen or twenty feet, and is a strong natural defence to the North line of the fort.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1747401P2' xml:id='OTP1747401P2'>The site is very comfortable &amp; healthy; and sufficiently near the city to guard it against <rs ref='#S86078'>insurrection</rs>. Captain <rs ref='#S84069'>Taylor's</rs> <rs ref='#S94830'>Artillery</rs> company is stationed there; &amp; ^the men^ are in good health and pleased with their situation. I think it would be well to keep them there, to practice them with the siege guns, &amp; to drill them in the exercise of light artillery; &amp; also to guard our ordnance stores, &amp; to protect the city against any domestic disturbance. I ordered Major <rs ref='#S93239'>Barnes</rs> to move the 5—42 pounders &amp; their carriages &amp; chasses now lying at the R. Road Depot exposed to the weather &amp; many injuries, to the fort, &amp; place them in position; &amp; erect wooden shelters over them to be used for the drill of the company.

<p corresp='TTP1747402P1' xml:id='OTP1747402P1'>I also instructed him to have built a plain, cheap, &amp; substantial store house of undressed Cypress lumber at the fort, &amp; deposit in it all the vacant gun carriages implements, and other ordnance stores, except the powder; and place the whole in the charge Captain Taylor. That Officer promised me to set the whole of his company to doing this work which will make it cost the state but a small sum; less I think than the expense of moving the stores away, or paying storage in the city, while the whole is going to decay. I also recommend that after Cap Taylor's company is ^drilled^ sufficiently, it be removed to active duty in the field; and another company of artillery recruits substited for a similar course of instruction. With this company, &amp; Genl. <rs ref='#S101379'>Tappan</rs>'s <rs ref='#S77526'>city guard</rs>, I think Vicksburg sufficiently defended for the present; if we supply the artillery company with some field pieces, and ammunition &amp; the infantry with cartridges.
