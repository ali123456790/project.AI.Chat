                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS72945P0'>John Jones McRae was a lawyer and statesman from Mississippi who served in the Mississippi House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, as the 21st Governor of Mississippi, and the Confederate Congress.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P1'>McRae was born on January 10, 1815 in Sneedsboro (present-day McFarlan), Anson County, North Carolina. At age two, his family moved to Winchester, Wayne County, Mississippi in 1817 and later to Pascagoula, Jackson County, Mississippi in 1827. He attended the University of Miami in Ohio, graduating in 1834. McRae returned to Mississippi to study law at Pearlington. He was admitted to the bar in 1835 and began practicing law in Paulding, Mississippi. In October 1835 he married Mary Annette McGuire, and the couple had three children together. He founded the newspaper <hi rend='italic'>Eastern Clarion</hi> in 1837.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P2'>McRae’s political career began when he was elected as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1847, serving as Speaker of the House in 1850. He was appointed to the United States Senate from December 19, 1851 until March 17, 1852 to serve the remainder of Jefferson Davis’s unexpired term when he resigned to run for Governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P3'>In 1853 McRae was elected as the 21st Governor of Mississippi under the Democratic States’ Rights platform. He was reelected in 1855. During his time in the Governorship McRae’s administration oversaw the opening of the state’s first mental hospital and established an asylum for the deaf and speechless. He also oversaw the State’s levy program in the Delta and signed the Mississippi Code of 1857 into law. McRae was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1858 following the death of Congressman John A. Quitman. He served in Congress until January 12, 1861, resigning his seat three days after Mississippi seceded from the Union. He was elected to the Confederate Congress and served from 1862 to 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P4'>McRae was not involved in public affairs after the Civil War. His wife Mary died in 1866. In 1868 he sailed to Belize (present-day Belize City), British Honduras (Present-day Belize) to visit his brother. While there he died unexpectedly on May 31, 1868. He is buried at Lord Ridge Cemetery, Belize City, Belize.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS55692P0'>William McWillie was governor of Mississippi in the late 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55692P1'>Born in Kershaw County, South Carolina on November 17, 1795, McWillie was educated at South Carolina College and became a practicing attorney in 1818. He entered politics in South Carolina in the 1830s, winning seats first in the state House of Representatives and then the South Carolina Senate. In 1845, he moved to Mississippi and lived on a large plantation. He immediately became active in the Mississippi political scene as a Democrat and advocate for state’s rights. Within four years of moving to Mississippi, McWillie won an election to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served in Congress from 1849 to 1851, but lost reelection to a Unionist candidate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55692P2'>McWillie remained active in Mississippi politics and in 1857 won the gubernatorial election. As governor, he advocated for public schools and railroad development. He remained an ardent defender of slavery, and in 1859 he called upon a strengthening of the Mississippi militia in response to fears of slave revolts, following John Brown’s abolitionist raid on Harper’s Ferry in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55692P3'>McWillie departed the governor’s office in 1859 and sought no other public position. He supported Mississippi’s secession in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. He passed away on March 3, 1869, in Kirkwood, Mississippi. McWillie was married twice, first to Nancy Cunningham, who passed away in 1827, and then to Catherina Anderson. He had 15 children. McWillie is buried at Kirkwood Cemetery in Camden, Mississippi.

It became part of the newly created Adams County on April 1, 1799. It served as the capital of Mississippi Territory from 1798 until 1802, when it was replaced by Washington. It was reinstated as the capital from 1817 until 1820, when the capital was again replaced by Washington (which was later replaced by the current capital Jackson in 1822). Natchez serves as the county seat. (Wikipedia; Britannica; Mississippi Encyclopedia)
