                    <p xml:id='OTPS53998P0'>William Durham Lyles was a physician and medical officer in the Confederate army during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53998P1'>Born on July 3, 1817, in Fairfield County, South Carolina, Lyles received a private education under the tutelage of wealthy planter and politician William Alston, before studying medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. He moved to Alabama and began practicing medicine until relocating to Macon, Mississippi, in 1840. Lyle’s medical practice proved very successful, allowing him to purchase a plantation, become a railroad contractor, and a cotton factor (a broker who sold cotton for farmers on a commission).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53998P2'>In the early 1850s, Lyles briefly became active in politics. He participated in the Union Convention in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1851, which debated the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—the effort by the U.S. Congress to settle the matter of slavery’s expansion into territories gained by the United States from the Mexican American War. Lyles was a Unionist who advocated support of the compromise with the northern states, and gained prominence at the convention, leading some to consider nominating him for governor of Mississippi. However, he stepped aside for Senator Henry S. Foote to successfully lead the Unionist effort in Mississippi during the early 1850s, and returned to his medical and business dealings.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53998P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Lyles volunteered for Confederate service and received a commission as a surgeon in the army. Due to his reputation and connections, he was almost selected to be Surgeon General of the Confederate Army, but the position was given to a different physician, and Lyles served as a medical doctor for Confederate armies in the western theater.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53998P4'>After the war, Lyles was elected to the Mississippi Senate. He then returned to his medical practice, and died on November 10, 1873, at the age of 56. Lyles was married twice, first to Martha L. Bonner, with whom he had three children. She passed away in 1844. Lyles’ second wife was Mary L. Bibb, with whom he had six more children. He is buried at Magnolia Cemetery in Meridian, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
