                    <p xml:id='OTPS94745P0'>Judah Philip Benjamin was a U.S senator from Louisiana and then a high ranking official in the Confederate government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P1'>Born to Jewish parents from London, England, on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, on August 6, 1811, Benjamin moved with his family as a child to Charleston, South Carolina. He briefly attended Yale College, but left before graduating, and moved to New Orleans where he studied law and became a practicing attorney. Benjamin entered politics in the 1840s, eventually being elected to the U.S. Senate for Louisiana in 1852. He was the first Jewish U.S. senator. He resigned his seat when Louisiana declared its secession from the Union in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, and returned to New Orleans. Soon afterwards, he received an appointment as attorney general of the Confederate government. President Jefferson Davis was so impressed with Benjamin’s abilities that he appointed him secretary of war in November 1861. Only five months later, Benjamin received another promotion, this time to secretary of state for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P2'>Benjamin served as secretary of state from March 1862 until the end of the war. He unsuccessfully labored to gain European recognition of the Confederacy, and during the final months of the war endorsed a last-ditch proposal to accept African Americans into Confederate military service. He fled the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, with Jefferson Davis in 1865, but separated from the group during their journey into the deep south to flee Union pursuers. Benjamin successfully escaped North American on a ship and sailed to Great Britain. He lived there for the rest of his life, successfully practicing law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P3'>Benjamin was married to Natalie Bauché de St. Martin, a French-speaking Catholic from Louisiana. The couple had one child before experiencing marital strife, and Natalie had moved with their daughter to Paris in the 1840s. Benjamin periodically visited his daughter, but his efforts to reconcile with Natalie were unsuccessful.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94745P4'>Benjamin retired in 1883, partly due to health problems. He died in Paris on May 6, 1884. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25006159P0'>Simon Bolivar Buckner was a Confederate general who later served as governor of Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P1'>Born on April 1, 1823, near Munfordville, Kentucky, Buckner graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1844. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Second U.S. Infantry Regiment, but served only a year before being appointed a professor of geography, history, and ethics at West Point. In 1846, Buckner resigned his teaching position to participate in the Mexican-American War. He served in the Sixth U.S. Infantry Regiment and saw combat at Amazoque, San Antonio, and Churubusco. He was wounded in the latter fight and later received a brevet (honorary) promotion to first lieutenant. Buckner saw additional fighting at Molino del Ray, Chapultepec, and at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P2'>Following the Mexican-American War, Buckner returned to West Point to teach infantry tactics. He resigned a year later—reportedly over a disagreement over mandatory chapel attendance—and served in a variety of assignments over the next few years, including in Kansas Territory, Minnesota, and New York. He left the army in 1855 and lived in Illinois for a short time before moving back to Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Buckner received an appointment as adjutant general of Kentucky’s militia. His home state officially declared itself neutral between the Union and Confederacy, but ultimately took a more pro-Union stance. Buckner held greater sympathies for the Confederacy and, although twice offered the rank of brigadier general in the Union army, volunteered for Confederate service. He received a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate army. Furious pro-Union Kentuckians indicted him for treason and confiscated his property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P4'>Buckner’s first notable combat occurred at Fort Donelson, where Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant—one of Buckner’s friends from the pre-war army—surrounded Confederates. Although third in command, Buckner was placed in charge of the doomed garrison when his two superiors chose to flee overnight. Unable to further resist, Buckner surrendered his command, giving Grant his first major victory of the Civil War.  Buckner was a prisoner of war for five months before he was exchanged for a captured Union general. Upon returning to Confederate lines, he received a promotion to major general and was placed in command of troops within General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Mississippi in the fall of 1862. He participated in a campaign into Kentucky in October 1862, which resulted in a Confederate strategic defeat at the Battle of Perryville. Buckner had performed well, but he and many other Confederate officers condemned Bragg’s abilities as an army commander.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P5'>In 1863, Buckner received command of the Army of East Tennessee but again clashed with Bragg, following the Confederate success at the Battle of Chickamauga, and then the Confederate siege of Union forces at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Buckner was among a group of officers that advocated Bragg be relieved of command, an effort that only resulted in Buckner’s demotion to division command. He traveled home shortly afterwards for medical reasons. After recovering in 1864, he was eventually sent to command the District of West Louisiana and promoted to lieutenant general. One of his assignments was to oversee the sale of cotton through Union lines—a controversial, but important means of gather funds for the Confederate war effort. The war ended while Buckner was in Louisiana, and he was the last Confederate general to surrender an army during the Civil War when he formally laid down his arms in New Orleans on June 2, 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P6'>After the war, Buckner remained in Louisiana for three years, according to the terms of his parole which prohibited him from returning to Kentucky until 1868. He spent those three years engaged in newspaper work and insurance business. When he was able to move back to Kentucky, he became the editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Courier</hi> in Louisville. Around this same time, he began pursuing an interest in politics. Buckner took part in several Democratic Party conventions in the 1870s and early 1880s, and in 1887 won election as Kentucky’s governor. He served until 1891, spending much of his time trying to reduce violence in the eastern part of the state and improving Kentucky’s tax system. After leaving the governor’s office, Buckner was considered a candidate for the U.S. Senate and for vice president. However, he did not generate enough support for electoral victories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P7'>Buckner died on January 8, 1914. He was married twice, first to Mary Kingsbury with whom he had one daughter. Mary passed away from tuberculosis in 1874. He married Delia Claiborne in 1885 and had one son, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., born in 1886, who became a U.S. Army lieutenant general and was the highest ranking American officer killed by enemy fire during World War II. The elder Buckner is buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.
