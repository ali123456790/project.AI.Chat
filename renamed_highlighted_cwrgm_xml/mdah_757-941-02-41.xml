                    <p xml:id='OTPS51698P0'>Thomas Jesse Wharton was attorney general of Mississippi during the Civil War and a circuit judge after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P1'>Born on May 18, 1817, in Nashville, Tennessee, Wharton was a good student and graduated from Nashville law school at the age of 19. He moved to Clinton, Mississippi, in 1836 to practice law, but returned to Tennessee the following year, where he married Mary Edgar. The couple had nine children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P2'>Around 1839 Wharton and his wife moved to Raymond, Mississippi. In 1856, he was appointed the state’s attorney general and his family moved to Jackson. He remained in that position for eight years, including during most of the Civil War. During the secession crisis of 1861, Wharton also served as a commissioner to Tennessee, tasked with encouraging his native state to secede and join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P3'>After the Civil War, Wharton returned to law practice. In 1882, after Reconstruction, he was selected judge of the Seventh Judicial District. He held that position until 1886. Wharton died on January 28, 1900. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

This board was to be made up of four brigadier generals and a major general in charge of the state’s militia, and the governor. On January 23, the convention elected the board members as Jefferson Davis (as major general) and Earl Van Dorn, Charles Clark, James L. Alcorn, and Christopher H. Mott (as brigadier generals). Shortly thereafter, the Military Board met to build and prepare Mississippi’s armed forces. It appointed Richard Griffith to the position of adjutant general, Samuel G. French to oversee the ordnance requirements, and William Barksdale for the quartermaster general. With appointments complete, the board then published instructions for Mississippi’s military structure, procedures, tactics, and equipment in the form of <hi rend='italic'>Orders of the Military Board of the State of Mississippi</hi>. Over the next several weeks, the board handled a wide variety of strategic and administrative tasks, such as planning the defense of Mississippi’s coastline and facilitating the purchase of rations and weapons for Mississippi troops.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD78266P1'>Although the Military Board began well, it soon ran into problems. Many of its members vacated their positions for promotions into Confederate service. Davis was elected president of the Confederacy, and the brigadier generals took military positions within the Confederate army. Mississippi officials appointed new generals to take their place on the Military Board, but the governor’s dislike of Alcorn caused controversy and led to another individual—Reuben Davis—being promoted to major general. Additional problems arose when most of Mississippi ‘s troops and equipment were transferred into Confederate service. Continued enlistments into that army prevented the state’s militia force from maintaining a steady number or presence. The Military Board spent much of its time during the summer of 1861 trying to procure sufficient weapons and soldiers for state service. By the fall, Mississippi officials believed that the Military Board was an inefficient method of governing the militia. The board was discontinued in November 1861. (Timothy B. Smith, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi in the Civil War</hi>, 52–60)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92926P0'>During the Civil War, Confederate military authorities used different levels of operational command to oversee their growing military forces and to respond to federal campaigns against the south. The military department proved to be one of the more effective levels of command for territorial areas. The department commanders reported directly to the Confederate War Department and Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Initially Confederate officials created military departments only for areas directly under federal attack. As the war developed, they created departments to cover the entire Confederacy. Confederate authorities restructured the departments as the war developed, and Union forces captured some parts of the Confederacy or military campaigns created new military needs in geographical areas. Some old departments were dissolved, or divided, and territories placed within new departments designed for contemporary needs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92926P1'>The first department to include parts of Mississippi was the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, established on October 1, 1862. It existed until January 28, 1864, when Confederate authorities created the new department of Alabama and East Mississippi. That department lasted until August 15, 1864, and the creation of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana, which lasted until May 1865 and the end of the war.

<p corresp='TTP1774060P4' xml:id='OTP1774060P4'>You inform me that the accts in the department of the <rs ref='#S25013611'>Quarter Master General</rs> show that the disbursments exceed by $<gap/>the amounts paid to him by the <rs ref='#S92815'>Treasurer</rs>, on your requesting—and you desire my official opinion whether you are now authorized to issue your requisition for the payment of this excess.

Master Gen<add place='above'>l</add> gave checks or orders on the Treasurer, in form of the holding of such accts, <del rend='overstrike'>and</del> taking their receipts. that the holders of such checks, to the amount above named, have not presented the same to the Treasurer for payment, but still hold the same I further understand that there is no controversy now as to the validity of said accounts, and that the object in making the demand upon you for your requisition at this time is to draw the money with which to pay the holders of said checks.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1774060P5' xml:id='OTP1774060P5'>The doubt in regard to the matter, I presume, grows out of the fact that the Military bill, of the late <rs ref='#S62915'>Legislature</rs>, which is understood to have superseded those in office under the appointment of the <rs ref='#S78266'>Military Board</rs>, has vacated the office

          <p corresp='TTP1774061P0' xml:id='OTP1774061P0'>of Quarter Master General, and the said bill does not provide that he shall hold his office until an appoint-ment is made to fill the vacancy, as provided in said bill.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1774061P1' xml:id='OTP1774061P1'>It is true that bill organizes a new military system for the State, and expressly regards all laws, and ordinances establishing other and different <del rend='overstrike'>syst</del> systems. Whilst there may be a doubt whether the general provision, applicable to all state and district officers, in the civil department which declares that such officers shall hold their offices for the term prescribed by law, <hi rend='underline'>and until their successors shall be qualified</hi>, applies to the officers referred to in the said Military bill, yet I think the doubt should be rendered in favor of such applications. First, because that is an es-tablished policy in reference to all officers theretofore created by the Constitution and laws of the State to pro-mote public conveniences, and prevent the possibility of an <hi rend='underline'>interregnum</hi> occuring in such offices. To show how strictly that policy has been observed and enforced by the Legis-lature. it is first made a <hi rend='underline'>general provision</hi>—applying to the term of office <hi rend='underline'>of all officers</hi> in this State—second—<hi rend='underline'>to each particular</hi> office, whenever reference is made to the term of such office. as you will perceive by reference to the provisions of the Code upon such subject. Code 90.91—Arts. 1 &amp; 2—136 Art. 183—The Constitution itself provides that "the Gover-nor, and all officers—civil and military, now holding commis-sions upon the authority of this State, shall continue to hold and exercise their respective offices until they shall be suspended <del rend='overstrike'>by</del> pursuant  to the framing of this Constitution, and <hi rend='underline'>until their sucessors be duly qualified</hi>"
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1774061P2' xml:id='OTP1774061P2'>^Second because^ Every reason which would apply to the civil department, in favor of such policy, more strongly applies, in such a cause as the pre-sent, to the <rs ref='#S92926'>Military department</rs>. An interregnum of a day or even of an hour, in the Quarter Master department, might be followed by unfortunate mischief. I therefore conclude that the Legislature did not intend that the offices created &amp; filled by the Miltary Board should be at once vacated by the Military <del rend='overstrike'>Board</del> ^bill^ before those appointed to fill their places could give bond &amp; qualify—but that those then in office should continue until the <hi rend='underline'>appointments and qual-ification</hi>of others to succeed<del rend='overstrike'>ed</del> them as contemplated by said bill; and that it is as competent for you to issue the requisition demanded, now, as if said bill had not passed. Some short time might elapse, after you should make appointments, un-der said Military bill, before the appointees could give bond &amp; qualify themselves to enter upon their official duties Unless there was no doubt whatever about the matter, &amp; unless the Legislature deprives you of all power &amp; discretion. I should certainly hold that they intended the present officers to continue until their successors are appointed and qual-ified
