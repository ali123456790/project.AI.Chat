                    <p xml:id='OTPS71503P0'>Francis Wilkinson Pickens was a politician and governor of South Carolina during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P1'>Born on April 7, 1805 (or 1897), in Togadoo, South Carolina, Pickens was the son of a former South Carolina governor and the grandson of American Revolutionary War hero General Andrew Pickens. He was well educated, attending Franklin College (part of modern-day University of Georgia) and South Carolina College before becoming a practicing attorney in 1829. Soon afterwards he became active in politics, serving in the South Carolina House of Representatives in the early 1830s. His term in state office came about during the Nullification Crisis, when notable South Carolina politicians, including one of Pickens’s distant cousins John C. Calhoun, threatened to nullify an unpopular federal tariff law that benefitted northern interests. The political debate was hotly debated within the United States and was one of the first efforts by a state to directly challenge federal authority in the United States. It sparked talk of secession within South Carolina. Pickens supported nullification, but the issue quieted down after several months due to compromise efforts by some in Congress, and since few other southern states had fully backed South Carolina’s threats of nullification and secession.  (President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently opposed South Carolina’s action, tempering many attitudes in the souths.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P2'>Pickens’s political career continued to grow in the 1830s. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from 1834 to 1843. He was offered to be Minister to England by President James K. Polk, and then later offered to be Minister to France by President James Buchanan. He turned both of those offers down, but did accept an appointment to be Minister to Russia in 1858. He spent two years in that country, becoming friends with Czar Alexander II.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P3'>In 1860, Pickens was elected governor of South Carolina. Almost immediately after he entered office, his state voted to separate from the Union due to Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. Pickens was less radical about secession than many of his fellow South Carolinians in 1860. He wished to avoid war, but was largely carried forward by events beyond his control. He complained to federal authorities about the occupation of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor by U.S. Army troops, and approved the use of force against a Union ship, the <hi rend='italic'>Star of the West</hi>, sent to provide supplies to Fort Sumter in January 1861. As tensions mounted over the stand off at Fort Sumter, Pickens felt tremendous pressure and authorized the overall bombardment of the fort by Confederate forces in April 1861. He remained governor until December 1862, and then returned to his home in Edgefield, South Carolina, for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P4'>After the Civil War ended, Pickens was elected to be a delegate to a state constitutional convention in September 1865. He introduced a resolution to repeal South Carolina’s 1860 ordinance of secession, a matter deemed necessary for the state to resume its normal political position within the Union. He reportedly encouraged his fellow South Carolinians to embrace peace after the Confederacy’s defeat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P5'>Pickens lost most of his personal wealth during the Civil War. He died on January 25, 1869. He was married three times. His first wife was Margaret Simkins. She passed away in 1842. He married Marion Antoinette Dearing in 1845, but she died in 1853. His third, and final, wife was Lucy Petway Holcombe, whom he married in 1858. He had at least eight children. Pickens is buried in Edgefield Village Cemetery in Edgefield, South Carolina.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS100344P0'>Joseph Emerson Brown was governor of Georgia during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P1'>Born on April 15, 1821, in Pickens County, South Carolina, Brown moved as a child with his family to Union County, Georgia. As a young man, he became a teacher and private tutor, and then attended Yale University to study law. He started a very successful law firm in Canton, Georgia, in 1847, accumulating wealth and prestige within the state. In 1849 he was elected to the Georgia Senate and then secured a seat as a state circuit court judge in 1855.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P2'>Brown won the 1857 gubernatorial election in Georgia, becoming governor at the age of 36. He championed public education and railroad development, appointing a savvy businessman he knew from Canton to supervise the state-owned railroad. The effort succeeded, and within three years the Western and Atlantic Railroad went from nearly bankruptcy to a financial profitable institution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P3'>Brown won reelection as governor in 1859 and was in office during the contentious presidential election of 1860. He was a Democrat and slave owner, registering nineteen enslaved African Americans in his household in 1860, and strongly supported secession when the anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won. Brown was one of the south’s leading advocates for state autonomy over federal authority. This state’s rights advocacy put him into conflict with Confederate officials during the subsequent Civil War, as Brown became a leading critic of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and policies that strengthened the government in Richmond and weakened Georgia’s military and political interests. He specifically condemned Confederate laws that allowed confiscation of goods and the impressment of slaves for Confederate labor projects. His opposition to Davis likely inspired officials in Richmond and in other southern states to oppose the Confederate government on key issues, weakening the south’s war effort.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P4'>Brown called for an end of the Civil War in late 1864, after William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union forces captured Atlanta, Georgia, and marched across the state to capture Savannah. He ordered the Georgia militia to withdraw from the military front and assist in growing crops to start rebuilding the state’s infrastructure. When the war ended in 1865, Brown was arrested by federal officials and spent several weeks imprisoned in Washington, D.C.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P5'>Upon his release from prison, Brown switched his political alliances from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. He supported President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction policies, served as a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention, and even scored an appointment as a Republican to serve as chief justice of Georgia’s Supreme Court from 1868 to 1870.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P6'>Brown left the Supreme Court to be president of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. His work there, as well as other business dealings, helped him accrue a personal wealth of over one million dollars by 1880 (nearly three million dollars in modern figures). When Reconstruction ended in 1877, he reestablished himself within the Democratic Party, winning election for the U.S. Senate from Georgia.  He remained in that seat until 1891, when he retired due to health concerns. He passed away on November 30, 1894, at the age of 73. Brown was married to Elizabeth Grisham and had at least eight children. Brown is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63179P0'>Andrew Barry Moore served as governor of Alabama on the eve of the Civil War. Born on March 7, 1807, in the Spartanburg District of South Carolina. He moved to Perry County, Alabama, in 1826, and initially became a teacher. A short time later, however, he began studying law and in 1833 became a practicing attorney. Almost immediately he pursued public office, serving as the Justice of the Peace for Perry County and then, in 1839, winning a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives as a Democrat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63179P1'>Moore served in the Alabama legislature until 1846, at which point he returned to his law practice. He remained active in Democratic circles, serving as a presidential elector for Lewis. Cass’s unsuccessful Democratic run for president in 1848. In 1851, Moore received an appointment by to the First Circuit Court. He spent six years on the bench until he was elected governor of Alabama in 1857. As governor, Moore advocated the improvement of state hospitals, including facilities for blind and deaf patients, as well as those with psychiatric conditions He also labored to expand railroad development in Alabama.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63179P2'>Moore was strongly pro-slavery, but a moderate on the sectional conflict during the late 1850s. As calls for disunion grew across the south, Moore believed that separation from the Union was not wise for Alabama. However, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860, Moore adopted a more radical stance and supported Alabama’s secession convention in early 1861. In preparation for that secession, Moore ordered state military forces to capture U.S. Army facilities around Alabama, particularly those guarding Mobile harbor. He also sent Alabama militia forces to Florida to aid secessionists there seize U.S. installations at Pensacola.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63179P3'>Moore time as governor ended in December 1861. He took an appointment as a special aid to the new governor John Gill Shorter, and continued to support the Confederate war effort by procuring and organizing supplies and soldiers. When the Civil War ended, Moore was arrested by federal authorities and temporarily imprisoned at Fort Pulaski, Georgia. After his release, he returned to Alabama and practiced law. He passed away on April 5, 1873, at the age of 66. Moore was married to Mary Goree and had two children. He is buried in Fairview Cemetery in Marion, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

<p xml:id='OTPS73312P1'>Born on September 6, 1806 in Steubenville, Jefferson County, Ohio, Dickinson owned at least two properties by 1837. His primary residence was in Nashville, Tennessee, while he also had a plantation in Columbus, Mississippi. In 1844, Dickinson sold his property in Nashville and became a Vice Chancellor in Columbus, Mississippi, where he relocated. He was a Chancellor of the Chancery Court for at least twelve years. Dickinson was also the enslaver of at least thirteen men, women, and children by 1860.

<p xml:id='OTPS89459P1'>Little is known of Barbour’s background before 1860. By that year, he held a minor public office as a chancery court commissioner in Vicksburg, assisting in sales of property from court decisions. He also was appointed quartermaster general of the Mississippi militia at the rank of major. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Barbour volunteered for military service, and served in the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry Regiment. In 1863, he received an appointment as Governor John J.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS89459P2'>Shortly after the war ended, Barbour partnered with J. W. Stratton to form a commission merchant and wholesale grocery business in Vicksburg. His fate after 1866 is not clear, as his business ventures no longer appeared in Mississippi, nor did he appear in any other state or local office.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS64002P0'>William Barksdale was a U.S. congressman who later served as a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P1'>Born on August 21, 1821, in Smyrna, Tennessee, Barksdale graduated from the University of Nashville and moved to Mississippi to practice law. He eventually left his law practice to edit the <hi rend='italic'>Columbus Democrat</hi>, a pro-Democratic Party, pro-slavery newspaper in Columbus, Mississippi. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Barksdale joined the Second Mississippi Regiment, serving as a quartermaster (supply officer).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P2'>After leaving Mexico, Barksdale returned to Mississippi and entered the political arena. He supported the Compromise of 1850, the controversial agreement among northern and southern politicians over the matter of slavery in the territories won from Mexico after the Mexican-American War. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1852, and served in Congress until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Barksdale was an outspoken defender of slavery in Congress, being present in several high profile debates and incidents on Capitol Hill. This included Representative Preston Brooks’ assault upon Senator Charles Sumner in the U.S. Senate on May 22, 1856. Brooks, a pro-slavery Democrat from South Carolina, had taken offense to an anti-slavery speech by the senator from Massachusetts. He walked up behind Sumner and began beating him with his cane, nearly killing him. The “caning of Charles Sumner” marked another polarizing incident in the brewing political battle over slavery, and Barksdale was reportedly standing next to Brooks during the attack. Barksdale was part of another physical altercation between anti-slavery and pro-slavery representatives in Congress two years later. During the fight, a northern congressman tried to restrain Barksdale and inadvertently knocked his toupee off. When the Mississippian quickly and awkwardly replaced the hair piece on his head backwards, laughter broke out and ended the brawl.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P3'>After Mississippi seceded in January 1861, Barksdale resigned his seat in Congress and volunteered for state military service. He was commissioned a brigadier general and appointed adjutant general and then quartermaster general of the Mississippi Militia. Soon afterwards he transferred to the Confederate States Army as a colonel and commanded the Thirteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment at the First Battle of Bull Run. Over the next two years he participated in several other battles in the Eastern Theater, including the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. After his brigade commander was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savage’s Station, he took over command and performed well, being promoted to brigadier general and leading to the brigade proudly being known as “Barksdale’s Mississippi Brigade.” Over the next few months Barksdale led his brigade at Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P4'>Barksdale commanded his brigade at Gettysburg in July 1863. He led his troops during the sudden Confederate assault on the Union left flank on July 2, striking federal troops at the Peach Orchard and pressing them back. During the vicious fighting, Barksdale was shot in the knee, struck in the foot by a cannon ball, and then shot in the chest.  Knocked off his horse by the final wound, Barksdale reportedly told a staff officer, “I am killed! Tell my wife and children that I died fighting at my post.” He died the following day, July 3, 1863, at a Union field hospital.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P5'>Barksdale was married to Narcissa Lucille Smith and had two children. He was also the older brother of Ethelbert Barksdale, who served in the Confederate Congress during the Civil War and the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1880s. Barksdale’s remains were transported from Gettysburg to Mississippi where he was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63092P0'>John Letcher was an attorney and politician who served as governor of Virginia during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63092P1'>Born on March 29, 1813, in Lexington, Virginia, Letcher attended various private schools and institutions, including Randolph-Macon College, before graduating from Washington Academy in 1833. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in 1839. Shortly afterwards, he became editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Valley Star</hi> newspaper in the Shenandoah area of Virginia and began participating in Democratic politics. In the late 1840s, Letcher expressed some support for ending slavery in the western part of Virginia, but soon abandoned any anti-slavery sentiment and became more immersed in Democratic and pro-slavery politics.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63092P2'>Letcher won election the U.S. House of Representatives in 1850 and served until 1859. He then successfully ran for governor of Virginia, professing a strong defense of slavery as morally and socially right. During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Letcher tried to broker a peace deal between the lower south and the north. He did not initially support secession, but in the spring of 1861, after Confederate forces attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Lincoln called for 75,000 Union volunteers to suppress the rebellion, Letcher and most other Virginians chose to support the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63092P3'>Letcher appointed Robert E. Lee as major general of Virginia’s militia. However, the state’s military forces soon fell under Confederate control, leading Lee to eventually become the Confederacy’s most famous general. Letcher unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Confederate Congress in 1863, but continued serving as governor of Virginia to 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63092P4'>After the Civil War, Letcher practiced law for several years. In 1875, near the end of Reconstruction, he won election to the Virginia General Assembly, and served until 1877. He died on January 26, 1884. He was married to Mary Holt and had at least eight children. Letcher is buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Lexington, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63404P0'>Thomas Overton Moore was governor of Louisiana during most of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P1'>Born on April 10, 1804, in Sampson County, North Carolina, Moore moved to Louisiana at the age of 25 to manage his uncle’s cotton plantation. He eventually purchased his own property and established a financially successful plantation. By the late 1840s he was involved in politics, winning a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1848 and the state’s Senate in 1856. He served as chairman of the state’s Education Committee and helped establish Louisiana State Seminary (modern-day Louisiana State University), with future Union general William Tecumseh Sherman as the school’s first superintendent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P2'>In 1859 Moore won election as Louisiana’s governor, taking office in January 1860. As governor, he spoke strongly against northern anti-slavery sentiments and vehemently opposed Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860. In January 1861, Moore ordered the state’s militia to seize U.S. military posts within the Louisiana, before state formally declared its secession from the Union. After Louisiana joined the Confederacy in March 1861, Moore called for Confederate support to defend New Orleans. As he feared, Union naval and ground forces advanced against the port city early in the war, securing in April 1862, and forcing the state’s government to move out of Baton Rouge for central Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P3'>Moore remained governor until 1864, most of his time in office seeing Union forces hold key parts of Louisiana. He returned to his plantation but was forced to leave when Union soldiers under General Nathaniel P. Banks raided his property during the Red River Campaign in the spring of 1864. Moore fled to Mexico and then Cuba rather than surrender to Union forces in 1865. From Havana, he applied to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon—the request being delivered by General William Tecumseh Sherman personally. Johnson pardoned Moore in 1867, and Moore returned to Louisiana. He regained his lost property, again aided by Sherman, but never returned to political office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63404P4'>Moore was married to Bethiah Johnston Leonard and had five children. He died on June 25, 1876, near Alexandria, Louisiana. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Pineville, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32001672P0'>Duff Green was a politician, general, newspaper editor, and diplomat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32001672P1'>Born on August 15, 1791 in Woodford County, Kentucky, Green's career started as a local school teacher, but his service as a brigadier general during the War of 1812 set the stage for political success. After the war, Green became a government surveyor and prominent newspaper editor of the <hi rend='italic'>St. Louis Enquirer</hi>. He was also elected to the Missouri House of Representantives in 1820 and the State Senate in 1822. By 1826, he reached the national stage with his purchase of the newspaper <hi rend='italic'>The United States Telegraph</hi>. His support for Andrew Jackson in the election of 1828 won him a seat as an adviser to Jackson on the President's unofficial "Kitchen Cabinet." However, Green's support for John C. Calhoun against Jackson ultimately ended this connection to the President. Green maintained his role as editor of <hi rend='italic'>The United States Telegraph</hi>, and he eventually took on additional newspapers, including <hi rend='italic'>The Reformation</hi>, the <hi rend='italic'>The Pilot</hi> in Baltimore, Maryland, and <hi rend='italic'>The Republic</hi> in New York City. As a politician and diplomat in this period, Green served not only Andrew Jackson during his first term but also the Presidents John Tyler and Zachary Taylor, and he was instrumental in helping to establish the city of Dalton in Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32001672P2'>Although he opposed secession, during the American Civil War, Duff Green supported the Confederacy by organizing three iron manufacturing plantsand  the Dalton Arms Company. This brought him into verbal confrontation with President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, but he was eventually pardoned by Andrew Johnson after paying a $20,000 fine. Duff Green died on June 10, 1875 in Dalton, Georgia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009375P0'>John Anthony Winston was a politician and governor of Alabama during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009375P1'>Born on September 4, 1812, in Alabama Territory, Winston was privately educated and attended LaGrange College (modern-day University of North Alabama) and Cumberland College (modern-day University of Nashville) in Tennessee. As a young man, Winston saw success as a planter and a cotton commissioner. He later entered politics, winning election to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1840 and 1842, before winning a seat in the Alabama Senate in 1843. He served in the state senate until 1853, when he won election as governor of Alabama. He served for four years, and gained a reputation for vetoing legislation, including bills that directed government funds for transportation projects, such as railroads. Winston did support public education, and signed legislation to create a state school system in 1854.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009375P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Winston volunteered for Confederate military service. He had slight military experience from his efforts to raise and lead a militia company in 1846, during the Mexican-American War. The unit was never activated for service in Mexico and it remained in Alabama. His wish to lead troops into combat was granted during the Civil War, as he received a commission as colonel of the Eighth Alabama Infantry Regiment and led the unit during campaigns in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009375P3'>After the Civil War, Winston tried to reenter politics. He served as a delegate to Alabama’s 1865 constitutional convention, and won election to the U.S. Senate in 1866. However, his seat was denied due to his refusal to take an oath of allegiance to the United States. He died on December 21, 1871. He was married to his cousin, Mary Jones, and had one child. Winston is buried in the Winston Family Cemetery in Gainesville, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53950P0'>Richard “Dick” Taylor was Louisiana state senator and a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P1'>Born on January 27, 1826, near Louisville, Kentucky, Richard Taylor was the son of Zachary Taylor—famed Mexican-American War general and president of the United States. Richard, who went by the nickname “Dick,” attended private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts, before attending Harvard College. He transferred to Yale for his university studies and graduated in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P2'>Taylor briefly served in the Mexican-American War under his father, but left Mexico due to health problems. He traveled to Mississippi to manage a cotton plantation owned by his family, and then moved to Louisiana after he inherited a sugar plantation following his father’s death in 1850 while president. Dick Taylor expanded the size of the Louisiana plantation property and its slave population, eventually owning around two hundred enslaved people. Taylor married Louise Marie Mythe Bringer, the daughter of a wealthy family in Louisiana, and became one of the richest men in the state. In the 1855 Taylor won a seat in the Louisiana Senate as a Whig, but changed to the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigrant political party) before joining the Democratic Party by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P3'>When the deep southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Taylor opposed secession. However, he placed his loyalty behind the Confederacy at the outbreak of war and received a commission as colonel of the Ninth Louisiana Infantry Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Virginia, missing the First Battle of Bull Run at Manassas by only hours.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P4'>Taylor was promoted to brigadier general in October 1861 and commanded a brigade under Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in Virginia in 1862. He performed well in several battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including the First Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Port Republic. In June 1862, Taylor received a promotion to major general, making him the youngest officer of that rank in the Confederacy. The new rank led to a new assignment, which involved raising soldiers in western Louisiana. When he arrived there, Union forces already occupied several parts of the state. Taylor led Confederate troops in several battles against federal soldiers in Louisiana, and led raids against Ulysses S. Grant’s army and supplies during the Vicksburg campaign. In 1864, Taylor successfully repulsed Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’ Red River Campaign in Louisiana. However, Taylor believed he had lost a chance to decisively beat Banks due to decisions by Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P5'>In 1865, Taylor was briefly placed in command of the remnants of General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, after its disastrous Nashville campaign. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama on May 4, 1865, was paroled a few days later, and returned to Louisiana to find his sugar plantation destroyed. He moved his family to New Orleans and remained there through the Reconstruction period. After his wife died in 1875, Taylor moved with the couple’s three children to Winchester, Virginia. He passed away in 1870 while visiting a friend in New York City. Taylor is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

In the 1850s, Mott became a Probate Judge, and in 1858, he received a temporary federal appointment as the U.S. Commissioner to investigate arrearages of debts in relation to Indian Affairs in the Oregon and Washington Territories. By 1860, he had returned to Mississippi, and with the outbreak of the Civil War, he was appointed a Brigadier General commanding the Ninth and Tenth Mississippi Infantries (state militia). By 1862, however, he had resigned his commission and taken a position as Colonel of the Nineteenth Mississippi Infantry, CSA.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32083641P0'>The first newspaper published in Mississippi was the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi Gazette</hi>, which went into print around 1800 in Natchez, before Mississippi Territory was formally organized. Several more appeared during the next few years, and by the time Mississippi entered the Union in 1817 at least half a dozen different publications had emerged. Over the following years, newspaper companies opened as communities grew and the demand for information increased. Publishing resources (like paper and print presses) became more available aiding in the news media boom. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Mississippi towns or counties had a local newspaper, published daily or weekly. Major cities typically had more than one newspaper, often published by competing political parties. Most newspapers went out of business after only a few years; however, a few continued in print for decades, including <hi rend='italic'>The Columbus Democrat</hi> in Columbus (1836–1877), <hi rend='italic'>The Kosciusko Chronicle</hi> in Kosciusko (1846–1892), and the <hi rend='italic'>Grenada Sentinel</hi> of Grenada which started in 1868 and remained in publication until 1955. Overall, as many as two hundred different publishers started daily or weekly newspapers in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92926P0'>During the Civil War, Confederate military authorities used different levels of operational command to oversee their growing military forces and to respond to federal campaigns against the south. The military department proved to be one of the more effective levels of command for territorial areas. The department commanders reported directly to the Confederate War Department and Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Initially Confederate officials created military departments only for areas directly under federal attack. As the war developed, they created departments to cover the entire Confederacy. Confederate authorities restructured the departments as the war developed, and Union forces captured some parts of the Confederacy or military campaigns created new military needs in geographical areas. Some old departments were dissolved, or divided, and territories placed within new departments designed for contemporary needs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92926P1'>The first department to include parts of Mississippi was the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, established on October 1, 1862. It existed until January 28, 1864, when Confederate authorities created the new department of Alabama and East Mississippi. That department lasted until August 15, 1864, and the creation of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana, which lasted until May 1865 and the end of the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32130587P0'>During the American Revolution, the Continental Army created the Adjutant General and the Inspector General as two different positions within the military. The Adjutant General was the administrative and personnel support element of the military, while the Inspector General was responsible for assessing and investigating internal military matters. After American independence and the reduction of the military, the Adjutant General’s Office took over most Inspector General duties. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Union and Confederate officials had to restructure the Adjutant General and Inspector General duties to support the massive expansion of military forces. State militaries, like in Mississippi, also grew rapidly in response to the war, requiring robust administrative and inspection capabilities. Mississippi placed all of those responsibilities onto the Adjutant and Inspector General Office. The Adjutant and Inspector General, as well as his assistants, helped facilitate the recruitment, enlistment, and organization of new troops in Mississippi, as well as oversaw rules and regulations and supply issues.
