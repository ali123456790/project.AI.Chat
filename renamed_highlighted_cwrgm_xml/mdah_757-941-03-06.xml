                    <p xml:id='OTPS104714P0'>Henry Alexander Wise was a lawyer, Governor of Virginia, U.S. Representative, and Confederate Brigadier General.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P1'>Born on December 3, 1806 in Accomac, Virginia, Wise became a lawyer in 1828. Afterwards, he relocated to Nashville, Tennessee to practice law. For finanical reasons, however, he returned to his farm in Virginia (called Only) in 1830, where he was also an enslaver, including at least nineteen slaves by 1844. He became active in Virginia politics, and by 1833, Wise was elected as a Representative for Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won five sequential elections, serving until 1844. From 1844 to 1847, he served as the U.S. minister to Brazil under U.S. Presidents John Tyler and James K. Polk.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P2'>Upon his return to the U.S., Wise became active as a lawyer, and he engaged in Virginia politics again. In 1855, he was elected as the Thirty-third Virginian Governor, serving in the midst of escalating tensions over the issue of slavery. Wise's goal was to protect both slavery and the Union, but John Brown's 1859 attempt to ignite a slave revolt in Harper's Ferry, Virginia shifted Wise's stance. Wise was petitioned to commute Brown's execution sentence to life imprisonment on the grounds of insanity, but he moved forward with the execution order, leading some to talk of him as a potential presidential candidate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P3'>Wise's term as Governor ended in 1860, and he became a vocal pro-seccessionist, advocating for Virginia to secede long before President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops, which triggered Upper South states like Virginia to secede. Wise was a delegate at Virginia's Secession Convention of 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P4'>In 1860, Wise purchased the Rolleston plantation near Norfolk, Virginia, but he moved his family to Rocky Mount, Virginia in 1862, as U.S. forces took control of Norfolk. During the Civil War, despite his lack of military experience, he also served as a Brigadier General in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and was initially assigned to the western Virginia region. Following an officer's feud, Confederate President Jefferson Davis reassigned him to Roanoke Island and various areas of North Carolina and Virginia. His command of troops included the Kanawha Valley Campaign (1861), the defense of Petersburg (1864-1865) and the retreat to Appomattox Court House (April 1865). He surrendered at Appomattox.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P5'>After the war, Wise relocated to Richmond, Virginia and resumed his law practice. He was unable to reclaim Rolleston plantation because of his service in the Confederate army. Instead, Rolleston became a school for freedmen. However, Wise joined the Republican Party, celebrated the abolition of slavery, and was a vocal supporter of President Ulyssess S. Grant. He had two counties named after him: Wise County, Virginia and Wise County, Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104714P6'>Wise was married three times. His first wife was Anne (Jennings) Wise, who died along with one of their children in a fire in 1837. The pair had five children. His second wife was Sarah (Sergeant) Wise, who died due to complications from childbirth in 1850. The pair had at least five children, including an infant who died soon after its birth in 1850. Wise's third wife was Mary Elizabeth (Lyons) Wise, with whom he did not have any children. Wise had up to fourteen children, including four sons and three daughters who lived to adulthood. He died on September 12, 1876 in Richmond, Virginia and was buried in the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63182P0'>John Buchanan Floyd was a politician who served as governor of Virginia, U.S. secretary of war, and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P1'>Born on June 1, 1806, near Blacksburg, Virginia, Floyd graduated from South Carolina College in 1826 and became a practicing attorney in Virginia in 1828. He moved to Arkansas to become a cotton planter, but the effort failed, costing him a large amount of money. Floyd moved back to Virginia in 1839 and soon became active in local politics. In 1847, he won election to the Virginia House of Delegates and was elected governor of Virginia in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P2'>Floyd left the governor’s office in 1852 and returned to the House of Delegates. He remained active in Democratic Party politics. In 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Floyd U.S. secretary of war. Although a popular politician, he proved to be a poor administrator. Apart from being criticized for his handling of a U.S. Army campaign against Mormons over control of Utah Territory in 1857 and 1858, Floyd was accused of fraud in the “Abstracted Indian Bonds” scandal in 1860, prompting Buchanan to request his resignation. Floyd left office in disgrace on December 29, 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P3'>Almost immediately after his resignation—as southern states began declaring secession from the Union—federal officials investigated whether Floyd had, as secretary of war, intentionally sent federal weapons and equipment to arsenals and forts in the south to make them more easily accessible to capture by secessionists. A District of Columbia grand jury indicted him in late January 1861, but the court dismissed the charges a few weeks later.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P4'>After Virginia declared its separation from the Union, following the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter and Abraham Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion against federal authority, Floyd volunteered for Confederate service. He was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate army in May 1861 and sent to support Robert E. Lee in western Virginia in the fall of 1861. Floyd’s aptitude on the battlefield appeared to match his limitations as secretary of war. He was defeated at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry and blamed his loss on Brigadier General Henry Wise. The feud between the two Confederate generals grew so heated that Confederate president Jefferson Davis had to intervene. Shortly afterwards, Floyd was sent to the western theater to support General Albert Sidney Johnston in Tennessee. Johnston placed Floyd in command of Confederate troops at Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P5'>Shortly after Floyd arrived at Fort Donelson in February 1862, Union troops under Ulysses S. Grant surrounded it. With little military experience, Floyd deferred to some of his subordinates, such as Brigadier General Gideon Pillow and Brigadier General Simon Bolivar Buckner. Although the Confederates conducted a successful attack to break out of the besieged fort, indecision and poor leadership by the Confederate command allowed Grant to counterattack and surround them again. Fearing that he would be arrested for treason if captured, Floyd relinquished command to Pillow, who in turn handed over command to Buckner. Floyd and Pillow fled the fort, although in different ways—Pillow took a small boat across the river while Floyd rode a steamboat with several Confederate soldiers away from the fort—leaving Buckner to surrender the fort and its garrison in one of the first major Union victories of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63182P6'>Floyd’s abandonment of Fort Donelson ruined his Confederate army career. Jefferson Davis relieved him of command in March 1862. He returned to Virginia where he served as a general in the Virginia militia, but he played little part in military affairs due to failing health. He died on August 26, 1863. Floyd was married to Sarah Preston but had no children. He is buried in Sinking Spring Cemetery in Abingdon, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25004269P0'>George Wythe Randolph was a Confederate general who served as the Secretary of War for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P1'>Born on March 10, 1818, at Monticello near Charlottesville, Virginia, Randolph was the grandson of former president Thomas Jefferson. He received a private education before attending school in Massachusetts and then Washington, D.C. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1831 and served until 1839, gaining experience at sea on vessels such as USS <hi rend='italic'>John Adams</hi> and USS <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>. While still in the Navy, Randolph began attending the University of Virginia and later studied law, becoming a practicing attorney in Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P2'>Following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Randolph was elected as a delegate to Virginia’s secession convention in early 1861. He spoke in favor of secession, but the convention ultimately rejected disunion during the first vote. Following Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion in the south, after Confederate troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, pro-secessionist sentiments grew in Virginia, and the convention passed a secessionist resolution. Randolph had been part of a Virginia militia artillery unit in the 1850s, nicknamed the “Richmond Howitzers.” Upon the state’s secession, the governor called the unit into state service, and Randolph was commissioned as a major. The unit manned artillery pieces in defensive locations along the James River and fired the first shot of the Civil War in Virginia on May 7, 1861, at a Union gunboat sailing up the river. In September 1861, Randolph was promoted to colonel in what was later renamed the First Regiment Virginia Artillery. On February 12, 1862, he was promoted again, this time to brigadier general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P3'>Only one month later, on March 18, 1862, Randolph was appointed Secretary of War of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. He served only eight months before resigning, in November 1862, due to health problems from tuberculosis that he contracted years before in the Navy. He recovered enough to take a seat as a Virginia state senator a few months later. However, Randolph sailed through the Union naval blockade in 1864 for medical treatment in Europe. He was still there when the war ended, and remained in Europe for another year afterward, finally taking the oath of allegiance to the United States in April 1866.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P4'>Randolph returned to Virginia, but died in April 1867 from complications of tuberculosis. He was married to Mary Elizabeth Adams, but had no children. Randolph is buried in the Monticello cemetery in Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS73325P0'>John Brown was an abolitionist made famous during his violent actions against pro-slavery settlers in Kansas Territory during the 1850s and for leading a failed revolt of enslaved people at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, on the eve of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73325P1'>Born on May 9, 1800, in Torrington, Connecticut, Brown moved as a child with his family to Ohio. His father was a staunch opponent of slavery, who advocated the forcible abolition of the institution and supported the “Underground Railroad,” or support network in the north for enslaved people fleeing the southern slaveholding states. As a teenager, Brown briefly pursued an education in the ministry, but ultimately became a tanner, enjoying success in that career field in Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1820, he married his first wife, Dianthe Lusk, and had seven children, before she passed away during childbirth in 1832. The following year he married Mary Ann Day and had another thirteen children over the next several years.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73325P2'>As his career developed, Brown became active in abolitionist circles. He moved to Massachusetts in the 1840s and met notable figures such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. Upon the passage of the Compromise of 1850, which instituted greater federal enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law, Brown established the League of Gileadites, a militant group dedicated to resisting the capture of self emancipated people seeking freedom.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73325P3'>In 1855, after the Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed slavery restrictions in the western territories and allowed settlers to vote on the slave or free status of their new states, Brown moved to Kansas Territory with several of his sons to fight against the expansion of slavery. After disputed political elections in the territory, and the creation of a pro-slavery territorial government, the struggle over the institution’s future in Kansas turned bloody. Extremists on both sides used intimidation and violence in an effort to control the territory, and in May 1856, Brown led a group that killed five pro-slavery men in what was called the Pottawatomie Massacre. This event helped spark a small war in Kansas, contributing to the moniker “Bleeding Kansas,” and Brown participated in several other skirmishes. By late the late summer of 1856, Brown’s violent opposition to slavery had been covered in newspapers nationwide, and federal authorities issued warrants for his arrest.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73325P4'>Brown left Kansas and traveled east to plan an even more dramatic attack on slavery. Securing financial support from some abolitionists in New England, Brown assembled a small group of volunteers, and conducted a nighttime raid on the federal armory at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia. His plan involved capturing tens of thousands of firearms to arm enslaved people in a large revolt across the south. On the night of October 16, 1859, his force of nearly two dozen men rushed into the town, captured some hostages, and then took a defensive position in the armory’s brick fire station. Within a day, a contingent of U.S. Marines, under the temporary command of Colonel Robert E. Lee, surrounded Brown’s raiders. After Brown refused to surrender, the Marines stormed the fire station, killing or capturing nearly all of Brown’s party.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73325P5'>Brown was wounded during the incident but captured alive and put on trial in Virginia for treason. The trial was a national sensation, reportedly heavily by newspapers in the north and south. Brown used the trial as a platform to preach against slavery and set himself up to be a martyr for abolition. Virginia authorities found him guilty and hanged him on December 1, 1859. His last words reportedly included a warning that “the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.” Following his execution, Brown’ remains were buried in North Elba, New York.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73325P6'>Celebrated by many in the north, and almost universally condemned in the south, Brown’s actions in Kansas, and especially his failed raid on Harper’s Ferry, are credited as key events in the build-up to the Civil War.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005041P0'>Military schools are educational programs that incorporate military studies with traditional academic topics. They often emphasize engineering and technical studies. The school lifestyle and environment typically model the military; students are considered cadets, wear uniforms and conduct formation drills, and follow a military-style chain of command. These schools were largely a nineteenth century development in the United States, following the creation of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, during Thomas Jefferson’s presidential administration. While that academy, and the United States Naval Academy, founded in 1845, were federal institutions, most military schools were private or state-funded programs. Military service was not required for the graduates of state or private military programs, but alumni from such schools often sought commissions in the military. Additionally, during the Civil War, the Union and the Confederate armies relied heavily upon graduates of state and federal military academies to train and lead the large numbers of civilian soldiers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD100571P0'>Founded in 1839 in Lexington, Virginia, the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) was the first state military college in the United States. The school was modeled after the United States Military Academy at West Point and the École Polytechnique school in Paris, France, leading to a more military and engineering program rather than liberal arts. Faculty members tended to be former military officers, including some from Europe. West Point graduate Thomas J. Jackson served as an instructor before becoming a general in the Confederate Army and achieving fame and the nickname “Stonewall” Jackson. Cadets at VMI occasionally participated in active military duties before and during the Civil War, including serving as a military guard during the execution of John Brown following his raid against Harper’s Ferry in 1859. Cadets at VMI also saw combat during the war, being called to action from campus fourteen different times by Confederate authorities.  Dozens of VMI alumni saw service during the Civil War. Fifteen graduates rose to the rank of general within the Confederate Army and one achieve the rank of general in the Union Army. The school remains open today, still serving as a state military college. (Wikipedia)
