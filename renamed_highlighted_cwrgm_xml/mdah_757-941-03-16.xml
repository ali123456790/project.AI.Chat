                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS91595P0'>Reuben Davis was a U.S. congressman from Mississippi and a Mississippi militia general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P1'>Born in Winchester, Tennessee, on January 18, 1813, Davis moved with his family to Alabama as a child and later to Mississippi as a young man. He initially studied medicine, but found his passion lay more in the study of law. He was admitted to the bar in 1834 in Aberdeen, Mississippi, and over the next several years became a prominent criminal attorney. He served as the prosecuting attorney for the sixth judicial district in the late 1830s and turned his interests to politics. He made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. House of Representatives as a member of the Whig Party in 1838.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P2'>Davis volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War, receiving a commission as colonel of the Second Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers. He served in Mexico, but reportedly suffered from medical problems and eventually resigned his position, having not seen combat. Davis returned to Mississippi and during the next few years resumed his political aspirations. He won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1856. Serving during a period of growing tensions over slavery, especially in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which opened western territories to slavery, Davis was among the prominent southern voices in Congress defending the institution of slavery and easily won reelection in 1858. He adopted a strong secessionist sentiment, and advocated for southern unity against Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860. Davis resigned his congressional seat upon Mississippi’s secession and received an appointment as a general on the state’s military board.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P3'>In late 1861, Davis was placed in command of the Army of 10,000—a unit of Mississippi soldiers who had volunteered for sixty days—in a campaign to Kentucky. The militia force actually numbered fewer than 5,000 men, and its short-term enlistments left little time for formal training or organization. As a result, the Army of 10,000 was poorly prepared for field service, and the volunteers spent their entire time in Kentucky in camp, suffering from cold weather and disease, before returning home in January 1862. Davis’s reputation as a military commander suffered as a result of the event.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P4'>In 1862, Davis left the Mississippi militia and reentered politics. He won election to the Confederate House of Representatives and soon became a vocal critic of President Jefferson Davis (no relation), in particular over the Confederate government’s efforts to draft men into military service. Reuben Davis resigned his congressional seat in 1863 and unsuccessfully ran for governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS91595P5'>After the war, Davis initially resumed his law practice. However, he became involved in efforts to undermine Republican Reconstruction, making speeches and rallying white Mississippians to oppose African American rights. Shortly after Reconstruction ended, Davis broke from the Democratics to join the Greenback Party—an independent, anti-monopoly political party that united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters. He ran for Congress as a Greenback candidate in 1878, but lost. That was Davis’s last bid for political office. He largely retired from public life and wrote his memoir, entitled <hi rend='italic'>Recollections of Mississippi and Mississippians,</hi>. Davis died on October 24, 1890. He had been married twice, first to Mary Theodosia Halbert who passed away in 1865, and then to Sarah Virginia Garber. He had three children. Davis is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi.

In 1843, he was appointed the Alabama state printer. Soon after he turned his attention to legal practice and became an attorney in 1846.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63572P2'>In 1860, Phelan won a seat in the Mississippi State Senate and served in that role until he was elected as one of Mississippi’s first senators to the First Confederate Congress. He served from 1862 to 1864. His most notable act as a Confederate senator was the introduction of legislation authorizing the government to confiscate cotton from southern citizens, with Confederate bonds given in exchange, for foreign loans. The bill generated a great deal of anger across the south and was defeated in the Senate. Phelan lost reelection in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63572P3'>After the Civil War, Phelan moved to Memphis, Tennessee and practiced law. He died on May 17, 1873, at the age of 52. Phelan was married to Elizabeth Jones Moore and had five children. He is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94858P0'>William Taylor Sullivan Barry served in the Mississippi legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives, before serving in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States of America during the first two years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94858P1'>Born on December 10, 1821, in Columbus, Mississippi, Barry attended Yale College, receiving a degree in 1841, and then studied law. He became a practicing attorney in 1844 and entered politics shortly afterwards. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1848 and served until 1851. In 1852, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives and served a single term there. Returning to state politics, he again entered the Mississippi legislature and became Speaker of the House in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94858P2'>In 1861, Barry was elected president of the Mississippi secession convention. When the state declared its separation from the Union and then joined the Confederacy, Barry was elected to represent Mississippi at the Confederate Provisional Congress. He held a seat there from 1861 to 1862, and then volunteered for military service. He helped raise the Thirty-Fifth Mississippi Infantry Regiment and served as an officer in the regiment during the Vicksburg Campaign. Captured there in July 1863, Barry violated the terms of his parole and returned to the field early to lead his regiment in the Atlanta Campaign. He saw heavy combat in 1864, sustaining wounds during the Battle of Allatoona in October 1864. Barry continued to lead troops in the field until captured near the end of the war at Fort Blakeley, Alabama.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94858P3'>After being released by federal officials at the end of the war, Barry returned to Columbus, Mississippi, and practiced law. He died on January 29, 1868. He was married to Sarah Fearn and had at least one child. Barry is buried Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS70887P0'>James Whitfield was a politician in Mississippi, who served in the state legislature and as governor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70887P1'>Born on December 15, 1791, in Elbert County, Georgia, he moved to Columbus, Mississippi, as a young man. He gained significant wealth as a businessman and planter, and became active in state politics in the 1840s. He won a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1842 and served in that body until being elected to the Mississippi Senate around 1850.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70887P2'>In 1851, the Mississippi Supreme Court passed a ruling that declared all state officers held limited terms that expired at the general election. The decision caused several vacancies, including in the governor’s office. The state senate convened and elected Whitfield as president on the twenty-first ballot in late November 1851, which placed him in line to fill the vacant gubernatorial seat. He immediately became acting governor and held that position until governor-elect Henry Foote was formally inaugurated on January 10, 1852.

<p xml:id='OTPS70887P3'>Whitfield temporarily stepped away from politics opened an insurance company and bank in 1852 that remained profitable for nearly two decades. He donated 185 acres in northern Mississippi for the construction of the Mississippi State Hospital. In 1858, he was again elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served until 1862. He stepped away from his political and business work in 1870. Whitfield died on June 25, 1875, in Columbus. He was married to Caroline H. Dyer and had at least eight children. He is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS68611P0'>William Littleton Harris was a legal expert and judge in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P1'>Born on July 6, 1807, in Elbert County, Georgia, Harris proved an exceptionally fast learner and graduated from the University of Georgia at the age of fifteen. He studied law and applied to be admitted as a practicing attorney as a minor. The state legislature had to pass a law to authorize him admission to the bar due to his youthful age.  In 1837, Harris moved to Mississippi and began a very successful law office. He became a circuit judge in 1853 and helped author the Mississippi Code of 1857. In 1858, Harris received an appointment to the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeal (currently the state’s supreme court) and proved to be a fiercely strong supporter of slavery and white supremacy. In 1859, he wrote the court’s opinion in <hi rend='italic'>Mitchell v. Wells</hi>, which rejected a former slave’s right to inherit property from her white father. The court’s decision concluded that African Americans were not citizens, as citizenship was reserved for white people.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P2'>In 1860, Harris received an offer to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court by President James Buchanan. He turned down the appointment due to growing political tension over slavery and his expectation that the south would secede from the Union. Instead, Harris accepted an appointment from Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, to serve as a secession commissioner to Georgia. He spoke before the Georgia General Assembly, calling for the south's separation from the Union in order to prevent northerners from ending slavery in the south and extending civil rights to African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68611P3'>During the Civil War, Harris served as a circuit court judge in Mississippi. Following the war, he received an appointment to serve again on the state’s High Court of Errors and Appeals, but was blocked by President Andrew Johnson. Harris left Mississippi in 1867 and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he began a law practice with two other attorneys. He passed away on November 27, 1868, from complications of pneumonia. Harris was married to Frances Semmes and had six children. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

It is comprised of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Legislature is responsible for passing new statewide laws and making amendments to the Constitution. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63339P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines marriage as “a legally accepted relationship between two people in which they live together, or the official ceremony,” CWRGM employs this subject tag whenever an author references marriage regardless of whether it was legally binding or not.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P1'>In the nineteenth century, marriage was shaped by coverture, an element of English common law dating back to the Middle Ages, which held that a married woman’s legal status fell under her husband’s. Married women could not sue or own property, including their own wages, and they did not legally have control over the lives of their children or of their own bodies. Wives were expected to manage the household or the domestic sphere. For most, these responsibilities included cooking, cleaning, and nurturing children, although elite white women in the South were also expected to manage household slaves, even violently.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P2'>Coverture, however, did not just shape the lives of women. Husbands were responsible for providing financial support for their families and for all aspects of the public sphere of life. Women, then, sometimes used the law and sentimental appeal to pressure recalcitrant husbands or even more broadly men in their communities to provide for their families. Poor white women, for example, sometimes used this argument to persuade public and private orphan institutions to accept their children, especially when their own husbands failed to live up to their roles as providers. This aspect of coverture played out most acutely in the South during the Civil War. By embracing their identities as “soldiers’ wives,” poor white women demanded that the Confederacy provide them with political protection and provide for their basic needs. In places like Richmond, Virginia, such women took to the streets in what historians call the “bread riots,” where they demanded public assistance, but their identities as dependent “wives” were central to this activism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P3'>Because marriage was a civil contract, enslaved men and women did not have these same legal protections and obligations. However, within the limitations of slavery, they married by mutual agreement, selecting their own partners in many cases, and they maintained affectionate marriages that mimicked the gender roles of the dominant culture. Men attempted to live out their roles as the heads of their families, while subordinate wives took responsibility for the domestic sphere. However, because these marriages were not legally binding and were subject to the needs and desires of the planter class, slavery made these marriages distinctive. For example, when husbands and wives had different enslavers, they were unable to cohabitate. In other cases, enslavers selected pairings based on their own whims, removing the possibility of choice. Finally, enslaved couples also recognized that marriage did not protect them from the Domestic Slave Trade. They could – and did – face separations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P4'>During Reconstruction, former slaveholding states were forced to pass laws that gave Black marriages the same legal protections as those of white men and women. However, this legal arm became a new way for white supremacists to control Black families. Couples who cohabited without that civil contract would be punished, and these men and women could be condemned for bigamy and adultery in cases where the slave trade had forced them to consent to multiple partners. Nevertheless, while some formerly enslaved men and women were ambivalent to legal marriage because of these punitive standards, most did embrace the opportunity for these legal protections, even seeing it as one step towards realizing full equality.

            <note resp="#U229565">A brief bit of research shows a Dr. Needham Hatch Whitfield of Aberdeen, MS. Born 1822, Died 1877. I can&#39;t say for sure, but I&#39;d bet that is this &quot;N.H. Whitfield.&quot; Also, a few different sites show a Sallie Ann Whitfield married to General Richard Griffith. I&#39;d bet that is the &quot;first cousin&quot; indicated on Page 2.  I didn&#39;t tag that one because I wasn&#39;t sure if that was within bounds for me, but it is worth looking into. Thanks!
