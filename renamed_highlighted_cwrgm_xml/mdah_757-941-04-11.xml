                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32060565P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32060565P1'>When Alabama seceded from the Union in 1861, the state militia appeared well organized. It technically consisted of all white males of military age. Each county had at least one militia regiment, and several counties formed a militia district commanded by a brigadier general. The combined state militia fell under command of a major general, with the governor as commander-in-chief. During the excitement of secession, groups of volunteers rushed into old or new military units, and state militiamen captured some federal installations in early 1861. However, most volunteers sought Confederate service for the broader war effort, and most Alabama volunteer units transferred to Confederate armies for operations far from their home state. Despite the fact that more than 82,000 Alabamans fought in the Civil War, the state’s militia system struggled to fill even small home guard units. For example, when the governor ordered militia units from 18 counties to defend the city of Mobile in March 1862, none arrived. Seeing the militia system as non-functional, the governor eventually requested that all able-bodied men still at home create their own volunteer units. That effort likewise failed, as most men not already in the Confederate army were not eager to put on a uniform unless forced.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32060565P2'>In 1863, the Alabama government established a “first-class” militia of boys under seventeen and men over forty-five. Now called the “reserves,” this state force was by law not allowed to operate outside of Alabama’s borders. In 1864, the state government specifically prohibited Confederate officials from appropriating the Alabama reserves. Despite these efforts, these reserves were not effective, and the governor frequently relied upon small irregular commands to enforce state military tasks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32060565P3'>Beyond manpower shortages, the Alabama militia suffered from a severe lack of supplies. The 48th Alabama Militia, ordered to defend Mobile in 1861, received pikes and knives due to a shortage of firearms. The problem became so bad that in March 1862 Alabama’s governor requested the state’s citizens to donate shotguns, rifles, ammunition, and any other weapons for militia use.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32060565P4'>Overall, Alabama’s militia system during the Civil War failed to provide a functional body of troops under the governor’s command. Some communities did raise volunteer units that served local defense purposes, and held a sense of identity—with names like the Junior Reserves, Senior Reserves, Mobile Regiment, and Home Guards—like a traditional militia. However, they operated more independently than the state’s militia system was intended. (Walter L. Fleming, <hi rend='italic'>Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama</hi>, 88-92; Encyclopedia of Alabama.)

Operating at the national level of the Confederacy, it was the Legislative Branch of the Confederate States government responsible for making and amending laws. A bicameral body, the Confederate States Congress was divided into the upper house (Senate) and the lower house (House of Representatives). The Confederate States Congress concluded Its final session on March 18, 1865. (Avalon Project-<hi rend='italic'>Constitution of the Confederate States</hi>; March 11, 1861; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of Southern History</hi>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum)
