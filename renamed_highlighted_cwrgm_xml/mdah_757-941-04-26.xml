                    <p xml:id='OTPS70283P0'>Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar, II (or Jr.),  was an attorney, politician, Confederate officer, and U.S. Supreme Court justice during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P1'>Born on September 17, 1825, near Eatonton, Georgia, Lamar was born to a prominent family, including a father (and namesake) who was an attorney and judge, an uncle who was the second president of the Republic of Texas, and two cousins who were justices on the Supreme Court. Lamar attended various schools, including Emory College (modern-day Emory University), before becoming a practicing attorney in Vienna, Georgia, in 1847. He quickly entered politics, aided by his family connections and name, and participated in various Democratic Party conventions.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P2'>In 1849, Lamar moved to Oxford, Mississippi, and began teaching mathematics at the University of Mississippi. He accumulated land and wealth in Mississippi, including an increasing number of slaves, and again sought political office. In 1851, he helped organize a branch of the Southern Rights Party—a fiercely pro-slavery, states rights movement—in Oxford and supported Jefferson Davis’s bid for governor of Mississippi. After Davis lost to Unionist Henry Foote, Lamar moved back to Georgia and found a friendlier reception to his political goals, winning a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives in the mid-1850s. When he lost a second bid for political office in 1855, Lamar moved back to Mississippi and established a thousand-acre cotton plantation near Holly Springs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P3'>In 1857, Lamar won election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Mississippi in 1857. He became an outspoken defender of southern slaveholding interests, participating in several verbal and physical confrontations during the tense political debates in Washington, D.C., during the latter part of the 1850s. After Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election, Lamar participated in Mississippi’s secession convention and then resigned his congressional seat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P4'>In the spring of 1861, Lamar volunteered for military service.  He helped raise the Nineteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment and was commissioned a lieutenant colonel. He suffered from health problems which interrupted his field service, although he did participate in the Battle of Williamsburg in Virginia. In 1862, Lamar was appointed to be a diplomat to the Russian Imperial Government. He traveled to Europe but was not successful in recruiting Russian support for the Confederacy. His efforts to generate support in England and France were also fruitless. Lamar returned to the Confederacy in 1864 and variously served as a judge advocate (attorney) in the Confederate army and as a staff officer to General James Longstreet.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P5'>After the Civil War, Lamar returned to Mississippi. He had lost most of his land and wealth, as well as family members and two previous law partners, to the war. He established a new law firm in 1865, but it lasted only one year before he took a teaching position at the University of Mississippi. While a professor there in the late 1860s, Lamar slowly began to rebuild his personal wealth by working with the Mississippi Central Railroad Company and doing legal work on the side. In 1870, he resigned from the university—in part due to fear that African American students would be admitted under a new school administration—and became an outspoken critic of Republican Reconstruction and Black civil rights. He had his law license temporarily revoked in Mississippi when he assaulted a witness and cussed at the judge and the U.S. federal government in a trial against the Ku Klux Klan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P6'>Lamar’s vehement opposition to Reconstruction boosted his political career. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1873—the first Democrat from Mississippi to serve in Congress since the Civil War—and then won election to the U.S. Senate in 1877. He retained his highly discriminatory views that African Americans were not equal to white people. These views did not compromise his political future after Reconstruction ended in 1877, and Lamar was appointed Secretary of the Interior in 1885 by President Grover Cleveland. In that role, he advocated conservation of natural resources and worked to reclaim millions of acres held by railroad corporations. He also advocated Native American citizenship and land holding.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70283P7'>In 1888, at 62 years old, Lamar was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although most Republicans opposed his appointment, he received the position by a slim majority vote. His time on the Court was uncontroversial and he served until his death on January 23, 1893. Lamar was married twice during his lifetime. His first was, Virginia Longstreet, died in 1884. He then married Henrietta Dean in 1887. He had at least four children who survived to adulthood. Lamar is buried in Oxford Memorial Cemetery in Oxford, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.
