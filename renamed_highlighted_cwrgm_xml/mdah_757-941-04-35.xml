                    <p xml:id='OTPS95173P0'>Whitman Coke Turner was a businessman in Mississippi during the mid-nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95173P1'>Born in Jasper County, Georgia, around 1822, Turner moved to Alabama as a young man and then settled in Enterprise, Mississippi, in the 1850s. He found success in business pursuits in Enterprise, including co-owning a commercial horse stable. By 1862, his company sold saddles and holsters for state and local cavalry militia units. By 1863, he was commissioned as a salt agent by the Mississippi state government, tasked with acquiring the large quantities of the vital mineral from various sources for private and public use.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95173P2'>Before, during, and after the Civil War, Turner was active in local politics, serving in several conventions and community meetings. In 1865, shortly after the end of the Civil War, Turner accepted a nomination to the Mississippi constitutional convention in a written statement, declaring that he had opposed secession but followed his state through the Civil War, and calling on all Mississippians to accept President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies to quickly reestablish Mississippians statehood in the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95173P3'>Turner died in 1868 at only 46 years of age. He was married to Martha Elizabeth Hundley and had seven children.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94528P0'>John William O’Ferrall was a high ranking officer in the Mississippi state troops during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94528P1'>Born on September 23, 1823, in Martinsburg, Virginia (currently in West Virginia), O’Ferrall grew up in Berkeley Springs, Virginia, before moving to Enterprise, Mississippi, in the mid-1850s. He found success as a businessman and merchant, aiding his standing in the community. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, O’Ferrall volunteered for military service in Mississippi and was elected captain of the “Enterprise Guards,” a militia company raised for twelve months of service to the state. He led the company to Pensacola, Florida, to aid in the defense of Confederate-held forts along the coast.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94528P2'>In July 1861, O’Ferrall received a promotion to brigadier general of Mississippi state troops and was placed in command of the Army of Mississippi’s Fourth Brigade. He remained in command of that force for only a few months before his two regiments were activated for service in the Confederate army. O’Ferrall did not transfer to Confederate service and instead returned to civilian life at his home in Enterprise. Later he received a commission as captain in the state troops, but wanting higher standing and a more active role in the war effort, O’Ferrall volunteered for service in the Confederate army within the quartermaster corps. Rebuffed in these efforts, he instead received an appointment as a tax collector in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94528P3'>Following the Civil War, O’Ferrall remained active in business affairs, including work as a cotton factor and insurance agent, and was among the wealthiest individuals in the community. He served in local public office in the 1880s, including on the Enterprise city council and his district’s Board of Public Works. O’Ferrall died on December 10, 1895. He was married twice, first to Margaret Rew Tolson, who passed away in 1867. His second wife was Helen Gains Walton. He had at least five children that survived to adulthood. O’Ferrall is buried in Enterprise Cemetery in Enterprise, Mississippi.

Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

We are not surprised that it will be in your power to furnish all these things If you can however we shall appreciate them. Our men are scattered over the entire county and it is with a good deal of difficulty that we can get them to gather When they do come in we have no means of providing for them, So we much prefer having our tents and camp equipage Sent here Men hurried off without preper-ation dont do well there are many little essentials that a soldier can get at home that he would not think to carry with him. Besides the trans-portation would be no more Hopeing that these requests will be completed with I remain very respectfully yours
