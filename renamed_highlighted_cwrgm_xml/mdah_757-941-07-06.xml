                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

It became the capital of French Louisiana in 1722 and continued as the capital when Louisiana achieved statehood on April 30, 1812. It became part of Orleans County (now extinct) on the same day. In 1849 it was replaced by Baton Rouge as the state capital, although it temporarily served as the capital again from 1865 until 1880. (Wikipedia; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73894P0'>In the United States in the nineteenth century, most college students, with few exceptions, were white males from elite families. Few universities admitted women or African Americans. The nation's earliest universities were established by Christian denominations, but college education, however, often served as much to provide social and cultural capital for aspiring social elites as much as practical knowledge (Roger L. Geiger, <hi rend='italic'>The History of American Higher Education</hi>, 267). From their findings throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, American universities exposed college students primarily to classical liberal arts curricula, including classical languages, logic, and the natural sciences, though that education expanded to broader subjects throughout the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73894P1'>Many colleges and universities, especially but not exclusively in the South, built their schools and supported their white student populations with enslaved labor. In many universities in slave states, students brought enslaved persons with them to universities. American colleges and universities, as well as their students, therefore profited from the enslaved labor of African Americans while institutionalizing educational and wealth inequality between white and Black Americans as well as between men and women of both races. However, other colleges, such as Oberlin College in Ohio, admitted women and African Americans even in the antebellum period.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73894P2'>In 1862, the Morrill Land Grant Act set aside federal property to be used to establish colleges devoted to agricultural and mechanical studies, broadening both the student population and curriculum of American universities. After Emancipation, many African Americans established colleges and universities across the nation, now known as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to increase Black Americans' access to higher education, though the full integration of higher education in the nation would not come until a century later during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s (Roger L. Geiger, <hi rend='italic'>The History of American Higher Education</hi>; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63339P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines marriage as “a legally accepted relationship between two people in which they live together, or the official ceremony,” CWRGM employs this subject tag whenever an author references marriage regardless of whether it was legally binding or not.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P1'>In the nineteenth century, marriage was shaped by coverture, an element of English common law dating back to the Middle Ages, which held that a married woman’s legal status fell under her husband’s. Married women could not sue or own property, including their own wages, and they did not legally have control over the lives of their children or of their own bodies. Wives were expected to manage the household or the domestic sphere. For most, these responsibilities included cooking, cleaning, and nurturing children, although elite white women in the South were also expected to manage household slaves, even violently.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P2'>Coverture, however, did not just shape the lives of women. Husbands were responsible for providing financial support for their families and for all aspects of the public sphere of life. Women, then, sometimes used the law and sentimental appeal to pressure recalcitrant husbands or even more broadly men in their communities to provide for their families. Poor white women, for example, sometimes used this argument to persuade public and private orphan institutions to accept their children, especially when their own husbands failed to live up to their roles as providers. This aspect of coverture played out most acutely in the South during the Civil War. By embracing their identities as “soldiers’ wives,” poor white women demanded that the Confederacy provide them with political protection and provide for their basic needs. In places like Richmond, Virginia, such women took to the streets in what historians call the “bread riots,” where they demanded public assistance, but their identities as dependent “wives” were central to this activism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P3'>Because marriage was a civil contract, enslaved men and women did not have these same legal protections and obligations. However, within the limitations of slavery, they married by mutual agreement, selecting their own partners in many cases, and they maintained affectionate marriages that mimicked the gender roles of the dominant culture. Men attempted to live out their roles as the heads of their families, while subordinate wives took responsibility for the domestic sphere. However, because these marriages were not legally binding and were subject to the needs and desires of the planter class, slavery made these marriages distinctive. For example, when husbands and wives had different enslavers, they were unable to cohabitate. In other cases, enslavers selected pairings based on their own whims, removing the possibility of choice. Finally, enslaved couples also recognized that marriage did not protect them from the Domestic Slave Trade. They could – and did – face separations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P4'>During Reconstruction, former slaveholding states were forced to pass laws that gave Black marriages the same legal protections as those of white men and women. However, this legal arm became a new way for white supremacists to control Black families. Couples who cohabited without that civil contract would be punished, and these men and women could be condemned for bigamy and adultery in cases where the slave trade had forced them to consent to multiple partners. Nevertheless, while some formerly enslaved men and women were ambivalent to legal marriage because of these punitive standards, most did embrace the opportunity for these legal protections, even seeing it as one step towards realizing full equality.

The student will find at Eureka Institute a large Cabinet of all kinds of specimens of Heads, Busts, Casts, Paintings and Books, which will illustrate the Lectures that will be given on the above subjects, during five months of the year, commencing the 1st of March, 1860, and so continue year after year.
