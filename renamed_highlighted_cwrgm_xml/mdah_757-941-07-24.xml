                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32118160P0'>Jehu Amaziah Orr was a representative of Mississippi in the Confederate States Congress during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P1'>Born on May 10, 1828, in Anderson County, South Carolina, he moved to Mississippi as a child. He graduated from Erskine College in South Carolina, before attending Princeton University in late 1840s. He left Princeton before graduation due to illness, but returned to earn a Master’s degree there in 1857. Orr became a prominent figure in Mississippi politics as a young man, being appointed as secretary to a Mississippi state convention on slavery in 1849, and later serving as secretary of the Mississippi Senate, a state representation, a district attorney, and then in 1861 being elected a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P2'>Once Mississippi joined the Confederacy, Orr won a seat representing Mississippi at the Confederate Provisional Congress in Montgomery, Alabama. In early 1862, he stepped away from politics to command the Thirty-First Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He led the unit through several battles, until 1864 when he returned to politics and took a seat in the Confederate House of Representatives, which he held until the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P3'>After the war Orr returned to practicing law. He served as judge of Mississippi’s Sixth Judicial District from 1869 to 1876, and then ran a very successful law firm, serving as the attorney for the Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad Company. He was married to Cornelia Ewing Van de Graaff and had four children. Late in his life, Orr became an outspoken supporter of women’s voting rights alongside his daughter Pauline Van de Graaff Orr, a notable suffragist. He was among the last surviving members of the Confederate Congress, and was widely praised in the early twentieth century for his more progressive views toward racial and social equality compared to his former Confederate colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P4'>Orr died in on March 9, 1921, at his daughter’s home in New York. He was 92 years old. He is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32083641P0'>The first newspaper published in Mississippi was the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi Gazette</hi>, which went into print around 1800 in Natchez, before Mississippi Territory was formally organized. Several more appeared during the next few years, and by the time Mississippi entered the Union in 1817 at least half a dozen different publications had emerged. Over the following years, newspaper companies opened as communities grew and the demand for information increased. Publishing resources (like paper and print presses) became more available aiding in the news media boom. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Mississippi towns or counties had a local newspaper, published daily or weekly. Major cities typically had more than one newspaper, often published by competing political parties. Most newspapers went out of business after only a few years; however, a few continued in print for decades, including <hi rend='italic'>The Columbus Democrat</hi> in Columbus (1836–1877), <hi rend='italic'>The Kosciusko Chronicle</hi> in Kosciusko (1846–1892), and the <hi rend='italic'>Grenada Sentinel</hi> of Grenada which started in 1868 and remained in publication until 1955. Overall, as many as two hundred different publishers started daily or weekly newspapers in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70883P0'>The Confederate Navy was the military naval force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It was established by the Confederate Congress on February 21, 1861, and was primarily responsible for protecting the Confederacy’s coastlines and harbors from federal attack and disrupting the United States Navy’s blockade of Southern ports. At its creation, the Confederate Navy had thirty ships, only fourteen of which were seaworthy. In contrast, the United States Navy had approximately ninety ships ready for service. Despite manufacturing limitations, the Confederate Navy eventually increased its size to slightly over one hundred ships and approximately 5,000 sailors. Still, it could not compete directly with the Union Navy, which enlarged to more than 650 ships and around 20,000 sailors.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P1'>Because of its smaller size, the Confederate Navy sought new and unconventional methods to challenge Union naval supremacy. This included inviting privateers—privately owned ships that engaged in warfare—to attack Union ships, particularly merchant vessels, for the Confederate cause. More famously, the Confederate Navy built ironclad vessels (wooden ships protected by iron plates) and the first submarine (named the <hi rend='italic'>Hunley</hi>) in an effort to defeat Union ships through technological innovation. These efforts did not change the trajectory of the war, though, due in part to the Confederacy’s inability to build these new ships in great number and by the Union Navy’s own development of ironclad warships.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P2'>Confederate Navy ships also performed blockade running operations and attacked Union vessels traversing the Atlantic to and from Europe. These efforts were intended to open avenues for Confederate merchant vessels to carry on foreign trade and to draw Union ships away from the Confederacy’s coast. However, efforts to overcome the Union blockade proved ineffective. Federal ships managed to reduce the South’s trade to only five percent of its pre-war levels.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P3'>The Confederate Navy was the last vestige of the Confederacy. It ceased to exist on November 6, 1865, with the surrender of the CSS <I>Shenandoah</I> in Liverpool, England. That event also marked the end of the Civil War. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD83857P0'>In both the North and the South, women formed as many as 20,000 Ladies Military Aid Societies (also called Soldiers’ Aid Societies) throughout the Civil War. Nearly every town and village had its own version. Organized and run locally by women, these societies supported soldiers by providing food and textile goods, including clothing, socks, tents, and bandages. Within the first month of the war, southern organizations also made cartridges and prepared sandbags. Working with local and state politicians, women also developed transportation networks to move gathered supplies into the field. Some women  even personally transported the supplies through these networks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P1'>Initially, Black women also supported these largely white women’s societies in the North, but the introduction of Black regiments in 1863 led Black women to create their own military aid societies, like the Colored Ladies Soldiers’ Aid Society of St. Louis, Missouri. These groups focused specifically on the needs of Black soldiers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P2'>Over the course of the war, these societies expanded their goals to include aiding soldiers’ families and the local poor, as well as taking on new roles as nurses. In the North, this impulse eventually led to the creation of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, Western Sanitary Commission, and the Central Association for Relief, which were dedicated to the support of sick and wounded U.S. soldiers. Reliant on private donations, these groups organized fundraisers, including social events like concerts, dinners, and dances. This sharpened women’s organizational and political skills, although most women stayed within the traditional domestic sphere.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD83857P3'>Ladies Military Aid Societies continued their operations after the war. In the North, their aims shifted towards veteran and orphan care, including helping families apply for pensions and providing direct aid for disabled soldiers. In the South, in addition to assisting veterans, these societies often became memorial associations, which were active in creating Confederate cemeteries and monuments. (Beverly C. Tomek, “Women and Soldiers’ Aid Societies; Wikipedia; Nina Silber, <hi rend='italic'>Gender &amp; the Sectional Conflict</hi>)
