                    <p xml:id='OTPS102902P0'>Thomas Withers Caskey was a Christian pastor and Confederate soldier during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P1'>Born on January 12, 1816, in Maury County, Tennessee, Caskey moved to Mississippi as a young man and initially studied to become a Methodist preacher. In the late 1830s, he married Lucy Jones and the couple had seven children. Caskey found work as a blacksmith to support his growing family, and in 1841 the family moved to Alabama. In 1843, his wife passed away during childbirth. Distraught, Caskey turned back to his religious faith. He left the Methodist Church for the Church of Christ and took up full time ministry work. Caskey served as a traveling minister, preaching in Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Tennessee in the 1840s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P2'>In 1845, he married Harriet Elizabeth Foreman, and four years later he moved his family to Mississippi. Caskey’s fame as a preacher grew, and he reportedly served as one of the Church of Christ’s best orators and debaters, reportedly engaging in more than fifty public debates against representatives from other churches across the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P3'>When the Civil War broke out, Caskey volunteered for military service. He served as a chaplain for the Eighteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Caskey earned the nickname of the “Fighting Parson” for his willingness to join his unit on the front lines and even shooting at the enemy. However, he reportedly chose to only wound Union troops, for ethical reasons and, supposedly, because it weakened the opposing force even more by requiring one or two other soldiers to leave the fight to carry off their wounded comrade. Caskey also worked in Confederate hospitals, tending to the wounded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P4'>After the war, Caskey moved to Meridian, Mississippi. He continued preaching, and traveled frequently to Texas for evangelical and business purposes. Eventually he moved his family to Texas and became a practicing attorney, on the side of his preaching. He saw only moderate success in the legal profession, and eventually fell back on his preaching as a career.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P5'>Caskey died on August 10, 1896, while visiting family in Mississippi. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS86445P0'>Braxton Bragg was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P1'>Born on March 22, 1817, in Warrenton, North Carolina, Bragg attended the prestigious Warrenton Male Academy as a young teenager and then entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, at the age of 16. He performed well at the academy, reportedly due to an exceptional memory and good discipline, and graduated in 1837. His first military assignment was in Florida during the Second Seminole War, but he served as a commissary officer and adjutant, seeing no combat. He later commanded a company of the Third United States Artillery and was stationed at St. Augustine, Florida, and then Fort Moultrie outside of Charleston, South Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P2'>During his first few years of service, Bragg quarreled with other officers and proved outspoken. He wrote a series of essays in the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Literary Messenger</hi> criticizing army leadership. For this he was court martialed upon charges of disobedience and received an official reprimand and temporary suspension of rank. Despite this punishment, Bragg continued to be argumentative. This trait, along with his propensity for strict discipline and obedience to regulations, made him unpopular and the target of stories and rumors among fellow officers. In his memoirs, Ulysses S. Grant, who knew Bragg at West Point and in the Army in the 1840s, recalled hearing of an incident in which Bragg served as a company commander at an Army post, and was made acting quartermaster while his another officer was on detached duty. As company commander, Bragg submitted a formal request for supplies from the quartermaster’s office. As acting quartermaster, he rejected his own request, with a written note on the order explaining his reasons. Bragg, in his role as company commander, protested that his supply request was appropriate, to which he, as acting quartermaster, again rejected the request a second time. Bragg then elevated the matter to the post commander, who reportedly exclaimed, “My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled [<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>] with every officer in the army, and now you are quarrelling with yourself!” While possibly apocryphal, the story reflected Bragg’s reputation among his army colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P3'>Bragg’s performance during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, boosted his army career and reputation. He earned repeated promotions for bravery. His obsession with discipline served the American army well, as his troops were among the best trained on the battlefield. He was brevetted (honorarily promoted) to captain after the Battle of Fort Brown in May 1846, brevetted to major after the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846, and then again to lieutenant colonel after Buena Vista in February 1847. His actions at Buena Vista were especially celebrated, as Bragg positioned his artillery at a key gap in the American line and repulsed a larger Mexican force. Among those who admired Bragg’s actions during the battle was Jefferson Davis, who commanded a Mississippi regiment, but later became secretary of war for the United States and then president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P4'>In 1849, Bragg married Eliza Brooks Ellis, the daughter of a wealthy sugar planter from Louisiana. She followed Bragg to his next military assignments, but by 1855 the couple chose to pursue a life outside of the army. Bragg resigned from the army in 1856 and he and his wife purchased a massive sugar plantation in Louisiana. He managed the sugar cultivation and production with the same adherence to discipline, overseeing more than one hundred slaves on the property. He became active in Louisiana affairs, receiving an appointment as colonel in the Louisiana militia. Bragg initially opposed talk of secession in the south, but followed Louisiana into the Confederacy. He received a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate army in March 1861 and was promoted to major general in September 1861. His first assignment involved commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida. Later, he was transferred to the Army of Mississippi where he commanded a corps under Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P5'>Bragg’s first major engagement during the Civil War was Shiloh, Tennessee, in April 1862. Although Confederate forces were forced to retreat, Bragg performed well at the battle and received a promotion to full general in the Confederacy Army only a week afterwards. He was given command of the Army of Mississippi, renamed the Army of Tennessee. His performance as an army commander afterwards in 1862 and 1863 had mixed results. At battles like Murfreesboro and Chickamauga, Bragg scored early tactical victories but failed to defeat his Union opponents. His brash personality and quarrelsome behavior aggravated subordinates, who called for his removal. However Jefferson Davis remained committed to Bragg and kept him in command of Confederate troops in Tennessee until November 1863, when Bragg offered his resignation following the Confederate defeat at Chattanooga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P6'>Even without a field command, Bragg remained a powerful military figure in the Confederacy. He served as an advisor to Davis and proved an able administrator for the Confederate prison system and medical system. In late 1864, he temporarily commanded Confederate troops in the Carolinas and Georgia coastline. Initially successful, a Union victory at Wilmington, North Carolina, in early 1865 undermined his standing, and he spent the final months commanding a corps commander under Joseph E. Johnston. He surrendered to Union forces in early May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P7'>Bragg’s sugar plantation had been confiscated by federal troops during the Civil War, leaving Bragg and his wife homeless at the end of the war. The couple briefly lived in Alabama, but moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1867 where Bragg became superintendent of the New Orleans waterworks. When he lost his job to a Republican appointee, Bragg received an offer from former Confederate president Jefferson Davis to work for the Carolina Life Insurance Company. He left the job after a few months and undertook a series of other positions with public works and railroad companies in Alabama and Texas, many lasting only a few months before he resigned following disagreements with other executives.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P8'>Bragg died suddenly on September 27, 1876, in Galveston, Texas, possibly from a stroke or aneurism. He was 59 years old. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

                    <p xml:id='OTPS104338P0'>Burton Norvell Harrison was an attorney, public official, and private secretary to Confederate president Jefferson Davis during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104338P1'>Born on July 14, 1838, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Harrison attended the University of Mississippi before graduating from Yale University in 1859. He moved back to Mississippi and briefly worked as an associate professor of math at the University of Mississippi. He began studying law, but suspended his legal ambitions when the Civil War broke out. Harrison became the private secretary to Jefferson Davis in Richmond in 1862 and remained an assistant to the Confederate president until the end of the war, even being captured alongside Davis in May 1865. Harrison resumed his legal studies while being held at Fort Delaware by federal authorities for the rest of the year.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104338P2'>Upon his release from prison in 1866, Harrison moved to New York City. He became a practicing attorney there and became active in political and diplomatic matters. In 1872 he served as an envoy to the Dominican Republic and in 1875 he took a position as secretary and counsel for New York City’s Rapid Transit Commission. Harrison attended Democratic Party conventions through the 1870s, but stepped away from politics after 1880. He even rejected offers by President Grover Cleveland to serve as Assistant Secretary of State and ambassador to Italy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104338P3'>Harrison died on March 29, 1904, while visiting Washington, D.C. He was married to Constance Cary and had at least three children. He is buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52243P0'>Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth president of the United States, whose election to the White House as an anti-slavery Republican in 1860 led several southern states to declare themselves separate from the Union and create the Confederate States of America. Lincoln was commander-in-chief of Union forces during the Civil War. Over the course of four years, Lincoln oversaw the Union war effort and took steps to end the institution of slavery to aid the federal military effort and destroy the root cause of the north versus south sectional conflict.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P1'>Born on February 12, 1809, near Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln moved with is family to Indiana as a child and grew up in a poor, frontier society. Although he received minimal formal education, Lincoln proved to be highly intelligent and a voracious reader. He held various jobs as a young man, including working on a flatboat down the Mississippi River, splitting rails and logs, and as a store keeper. He moved to Illinois in 1830 and in 1832, he volunteered for military service during the Black Hawk War in Illinois. Elected captain of a militia company, Lincoln saw no combat, but credited his time leading men in the military as one of the most proud and instructional periods of his life.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P2'>After the Black Hawk War, Lincoln operated a general store in New Salem, Illinois. When the business began to lose money, he decided to study law and become an attorney. Unlike most other lawyers, who attended a law school or studied under established attorneys, Lincoln’s education was self-guided through legal texts and books he borrowed or purchased. Meanwhile, he developed an interest in politics. After an unsuccessful run for the Illinois legislature in 1833, he ran again in 1834 and won a seat in the state’s House of Representatives. He served one term and became known for his support of internal improvements and his Free Soil position on slavery, which opposed slavery in the new territories and criticized abolition (the immediate, forced end of slavery).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P3'>After leaving the Illinois legislature in 1836, Lincoln became a successful attorney in Springfield. He handled many different types of cases, and over the course of his legal career, representing poor individuals in criminal cases as well as large businesses, such as the Illinois Central Railroad. Lincoln argued 175 cases before the Illinois Supreme Court, serving as the single attorney in 51 of those cases (31 of which he won). As an attorney, he developed a reputation for integrity and earned the nickname “Honest Abe.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P4'>In 1846, Lincoln won an election as a member of the Whig Party to the U.S. House of Representatives for Illinois. As a freshman congressman, he helped author legislation to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but the bill died due to insufficient support. More notably, Lincoln opposed the Mexican-American War which erupted in 1846 due to a border dispute between the United States and Mexico. He criticized Democratic president James K. Polk, but this proved unpopular in his home state. He had promised to only serve one term in Congress and declined to run for reelection. He returned to Springfield after the expiration of his term in 1849 and resumed his law practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P5'>Lincoln’s political ambitions continued to grow in the 1850s. The volatile debate over the future of slavery in the territories, especially following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854—which overturned slavery restrictions established by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and opened all western territories to slavery through popular sovereignty (vote of the residents)—inspired Lincoln to speak publicly about his opposition to slavery. His chief rival became Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas, a powerful voice in the national Democratic Party, and the author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Lincoln gave numerous speeches denouncing slavery as a moral wrong and opposing its extension into the territories. However, like most northerners, he was not an abolitionist and did not advocate for the immediate end of slavery across the United States. Most white Americans during the 1850s embraced white supremacy, and many northerners did not want African Americans—as slaves or as free people—in their communities. Lincoln believed that southern states had the legal right to maintain the institution of slavery within their own borders, and he fended off accusations that he was for African American equality. For years he gave tacit support to a plan promoted among moderate politicians to send freed slaves to Africa.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P6'>The issue of slavery in the territories effectively broke apart the Whig Party and gave rise to the new Republican Party. Lincoln joined this new anti-slavery party and by 1858 received the party’s nomination in Illinois to challenge Douglas’s reelection to the U.S. Senate. Upon receiving the nomination, Lincoln gave one of his most famous speeches, declaring in part that “a house divided against itself cannot stand”—a reference to the United States being half slaveholding and half free—and predicting that the fight over slavery would either make the country give in to slaveholding interests or end the institution. During the 1858 Illinois campaign, Lincoln and Douglas engaged in eight public debates which have become the most famous political debates in United States history. Douglas championed his principle of “popular sovereignty,” allowing white residents of the territories to make their new states free or slaveholding, while Lincoln advanced a moral opposition to slavery in the territories as contrary to the principles of American freedom. Douglas ultimately won the Senate election, but the debates catapulted Lincoln to national fame and the leading voice for the growing anti-slavery movement in the north
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P7'>Only two years later, in 1860, the Republican Party nominated Lincoln for U.S. president. His chief rival was, again, Stephen Douglas. The election was the most contested and significant in American history. The Democratic Party split during its convention over the defense of slavery. Douglas and his outwardly neutral platform on slavery received the party’s formal nomination, but many southern delegates walked out to hold their convention, nominating John C. Breckenridge as the champion of pro-slavery interests. Talk of secession, which had circulated in years past, increased as southern politicians warned that election of Lincoln would be a direct assault upon their slaveholding interests and justify disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P8'>Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election without any southern support, not only placing the first truly anti-slavery president in the White House but proving that northern voters could elect a candidate against southern interests. Within weeks, states in the lower south began holding secession conventions to declare their separation from the Union. South Carolina led the way with its ordnance of secession passing on December 20, 1860. Mississippi was second, on January 9, 1861. In total, seven southern states declared secession even before Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P9'>Lincoln entered the presidency in the midst of this secession crisis. He rejected the legitimacy of the lower south’s separation from the Union. The matter erupted into open hostilities in April 1861, when Confederate forces attacked and overwhelmed federal troops at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. In response, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion, as he called it. Northern states responded enthusiastically, while several states in the upper south—including Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee—chose to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P10'>Lincoln’s objective at the start of the Civil War was restoration of the Union as it was. He resisted efforts by more radical anti-slavery northerners to attack slavery itself, and overruled Union general John C. Frémont’s effort to liberate slaves in Missouri in 1861. His actions were guided by concerns regarding his legal authority to challenge slavery where it already existed, and from fears that such steps would drive moderate Unionists in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland into the Confederacy. (Lincoln still personally opposed slavery and in 1862 signed an emancipation act liberating enslaved people in Washington, D.C., fulfilling a goal he had first undertaken as a congressman in the 1840s.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P11'>However, as Confederate military forces won multiple battlefield victories in 1861 and 1862, prolonging the conflict, Lincoln sought more desperate measures. For one, thousands of enslaved people had fled to Union lines, and more arriving daily. Secondly, the institution was the Confederacy’s greatest economic and labor interest. Millions of enslaved people grew crops that fed and funded the Confederate war effort, and southern officials used slave labor to construct forts and trenches that held back the Union armies. Recognizing that the Union could not defeat the Confederacy while protecting or leaving the institution of slavery untouched, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in secessionist areas permanently free. Although the proclamation was limited in scope (as it was a military measure that did not, nor could not, liberate enslaved people in areas not in rebellion against federal authority), it was a revolutionary act in American history. It formally changed the Union objective of the war, from preserving it as it was to “a new birth of freedom,” as Lincoln famously said in a speech in November 1863 at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Additionally, the proclamation authorized federal officers to protect the freedom of all enslaved people who fled to Union armies in Confederate territories and to liberate those they encountered during their campaigns in the south. Finally, the Emancipation Proclamation formally authorized the United States military to enlist African American soldiers. As a result around 180,000 black soldiers fought for the Union during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P12'>Throughout the Civil War, Lincoln struggled to lead the Union war effort in a challenging political and military environment. Democrats in the north vehemently opposed his administration and Republican Party policies, particularly those against slavery. Union generals in Virginia failed to defeat the Confederate army, lowering morale in the north and boosting prospects of southern success. Lincoln managed to handle these various challenges well, often accepting public criticism from generals and relieving them of command only when they failed to deliver military victories. He also stretched the authority of the presidency, authorizing the imprisonment of critics he believed directly harmed the war effort. While his administration was accused of violating the civil rights of some Americans, the Republican-led Congress frequently backed Lincoln and expanding his power.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P13'>In 1864, Lincoln feared he would lose reelection as the Civil War continued to drag on, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and millions of dollars. However, through battlefield successes by Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan in Virginia and Georgia, Lincoln won the election and support to continue the war until Confederate defeat. He also worked behind the scenes with Congress and various state leaders to legally end slavery through a constitutional amendment. While he voiced some support for the old plan of relocating freed slaves to Africa, by the end of the war Lincoln knew such plan was impractical and he supported protecting basic civil rights of African Americans within the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P14'>In the spring of 1865, the Confederate war effort began to collapse. Much of Lincoln’s attention was turned to reconstructing the former Confederate areas, some of which were already under federal control. He advocated for a speedy reunification, without malice or vengeance, and one in which former secessionists were welcomed back to the Union without slavery and with some recognitions of black civil rights. In April 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to General Grant in Virginia and Union forces chased down the last southern troops across the lower south. On April 14, as the Civil War was ending, Lincoln was shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. The mortally wounded president was carried to a boarding house across the street where he passed away the following morning. Lincoln’s murder ended most hopes for a peaceful reconstruction, as it inflamed tensions in the north and energized Radical Republicans who Lincoln had largely held in check.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P15'>Lincoln was married to Mary Todd, who was from a wealthy family in Kentucky. He had four sons, only one of whom (Robert) survived into adulthood. Lincoln is buried in a large tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94831P0'>Martial law is the temporary replacement of civilian government by military authorities, often in response to an emergency. The American Civil War and Reconstruction Era saw several examples of military authorities implementing martial law. These efforts were less controversial when Union commanders imposed military authority over occupied Confederate communities, but generated great concern when they affected people in areas that had not formally seceded. For example, in 1861, Union general John C. Frémont declared martial law in Missouri in August 1861. His declaration further inflamed tensions because it announced the emancipation of enslaved people enslaved by pro-secession Missourians. Despite having a substantial pro-secessionist population, the state was still officially part of the Union. President Abraham Lincoln overturned Frémont’s order.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94831P1'>Many examples of martial law during the Civil War involved arresting and detaining individuals that federal authorities feared would be released by local courts antagonistic to the federal government’s military objectives. Lincoln proclaimed martial law in September 1862 in order to arrest and prosecute in military tribunals people accused of rebelling against federal authority, discouraging army enlistments, resisting militia drafts, or aiding Confederates. Republicans in Congress backed the president and passed legislation to authorize his suspension of some civil liberties. These measures received severe criticism from Democrats, and in the case <hi rend='italic'>Ex Parte Milligan</hi>, the Supreme Court ruled against the Lincoln Administration’s use martial law in areas where the civilian government and courts were functional.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94831P2'>Confederate officials also declared martial law during the Civil War. Confederate president Jefferson Davis imposed martial law over portions of Virginia in February and March 1862, in anticipation of civil disturbances and emergencies resulting from the Union Army’s advance to Richmond. Later, Davis extended martial law over eastern Tennessee and parts of South Carolina, to crack down on anti-Confederate activities within pro-Union communities. Confederate military commanders followed suit, including Major General Earl Van Dorn’s declaration of martial law in Mississippi in 1862. These efforts received fierce criticism, particularly as Confederate fortunes in the war faded. Davis’s opponents argued that martial law and the suspension of the writ of <hi rend='italic'>habeas corpus</hi> strengthened the Confederate government’s power at the expense of states rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94831P3'>Examples of martial law continued after the Civil War. During Reconstruction in 1867, in response to efforts by former Confederates to suppress African American civil rights, the U.S. Congress passed the Military Reconstruction Act, which placed the former Confederate states under martial law and divided them into military districts. The act declared that the states could reenter the Union and regain their civilian governments after they ratified the Fourteenth Amendment protecting the rights of black Southerners. Federal military authorities continued to govern, or intercede in local matters, in parts of the South until the end of Reconstruction in 1877. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
