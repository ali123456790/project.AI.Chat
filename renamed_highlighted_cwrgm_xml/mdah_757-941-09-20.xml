                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101531P1'>Born in 1828 in Madison County, Mississippi, Balfour’s family were wealthy land owners and related by marriage to Jefferson Davis (U.S. senator, U.S. secretary of war, and then president of the Confederacy). Balfour was well educated and graduated from Oakland College.

<p xml:id='OTPS101531P2'>During the Civil War he raised a state militia unit, nicknamed the “Beauregard Rifles” and was later appointed lieutenant colonel of the Sixth Mississippi Battalion. Balfour moved to different military units during the war, variously serving as a major in the Eighteen Mississippi Infantry Regiment and as a lieutenant colonel in the Thirty-first Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He was then commissioned as a colonel and authorized to raise the Forty-ninth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, but the unit was not formally organized. Balfour participated in several battles, most notably during the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS103325P1'>Born on June 22, 1822, in Bennettsville, South Carolina, Easterling moved to Mississippi as an adult. During the Civil War he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Forty-sixth Mississippi Infantry Regiment and saw combat during the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi. The regiment was captured by Ulysses S. Grant’s army at Vicksburg in July 1863. After it was parole several weeks later, Easterling resigned and in 1864 he was commissioned as a colonel and placed in command of a cavalry regiment in the Mississippi state troops. Easterling was elected to the Mississippi state legislature, once during the Civil War and the second time in 1866.

<p xml:id='OTPS103325P2'>He was married twice, first to Emily Ann Weatherby. She passed away in 1863, and in 1873 he married Helen Todd. He had at least eight children that survived to adulthood. Easterling died on February 15, 1904, and is buried in Liberty Cemetery in Pearl, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD68643P0'>Military elections were a common practice within volunteer and militia units of both the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War, a tradition with its roots going back to the Revolutionary War. These elections took place at the company and regimental levels. Company officers were elected by the unit’s soldiers, and in turn, these company officers elected the regiment’s Colonel, Lt. Colonel, and Majors. Officially, Governors had the authority to appoint a Colonel to command a regiment but usually deferred to the officer elected by the regiment's men. Often, these elections put men without military experience or otherwise unqualified to lead their units into battle with disastrous outcomes. Also, junior officers found it difficult to enforce military discipline as they were beholden to the soldiers for their position, which they could be voted out of.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD68643P1'>Union and Confederate authorities sought to limit the detrimental effects of these officer elections. On July 22, 1861, the day after the Union loss at the First Battle of Bull Run, the United States Congress authorized an examination board for officers. Many were deemed unfit and removed, while others resigned. The Confederate Congress established a similar board on October 13, 1862. Military elections continued during the war but to a lesser extent due to government oversight on both sides. They eventually ended in favor of ensuring qualified officers were put in command positions. (James M. McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</hi>; <hi rend='italic'>Public Laws of the Confederate States of America</hi>, 1862 Public Laws, S2, 85-87; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
