                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25004269P0'>George Wythe Randolph was a Confederate general who served as the Secretary of War for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P1'>Born on March 10, 1818, at Monticello near Charlottesville, Virginia, Randolph was the grandson of former president Thomas Jefferson. He received a private education before attending school in Massachusetts and then Washington, D.C. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1831 and served until 1839, gaining experience at sea on vessels such as USS <hi rend='italic'>John Adams</hi> and USS <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>. While still in the Navy, Randolph began attending the University of Virginia and later studied law, becoming a practicing attorney in Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P2'>Following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Randolph was elected as a delegate to Virginia’s secession convention in early 1861. He spoke in favor of secession, but the convention ultimately rejected disunion during the first vote. Following Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion in the south, after Confederate troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, pro-secessionist sentiments grew in Virginia, and the convention passed a secessionist resolution. Randolph had been part of a Virginia militia artillery unit in the 1850s, nicknamed the “Richmond Howitzers.” Upon the state’s secession, the governor called the unit into state service, and Randolph was commissioned as a major. The unit manned artillery pieces in defensive locations along the James River and fired the first shot of the Civil War in Virginia on May 7, 1861, at a Union gunboat sailing up the river. In September 1861, Randolph was promoted to colonel in what was later renamed the First Regiment Virginia Artillery. On February 12, 1862, he was promoted again, this time to brigadier general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P3'>Only one month later, on March 18, 1862, Randolph was appointed Secretary of War of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. He served only eight months before resigning, in November 1862, due to health problems from tuberculosis that he contracted years before in the Navy. He recovered enough to take a seat as a Virginia state senator a few months later. However, Randolph sailed through the Union naval blockade in 1864 for medical treatment in Europe. He was still there when the war ended, and remained in Europe for another year afterward, finally taking the oath of allegiance to the United States in April 1866.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P4'>Randolph returned to Virginia, but died in April 1867 from complications of tuberculosis. He was married to Mary Elizabeth Adams, but had no children. Randolph is buried in the Monticello cemetery in Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD54079P0'>The Congress of the Confederate States of America was established by Article 1 of the Confederate States Constitution on March 11, 1861 in Montgomery, Alabama. Operating at the national level of the Confederacy, it was the Legislative Branch of the Confederate States government responsible for making and amending laws. A bicameral body, the Confederate States Congress was divided into the upper house (Senate) and the lower house (House of Representatives). The Confederate States Congress concluded Its final session on March 18, 1865. (Avalon Project-<hi rend='italic'>Constitution of the Confederate States</hi>; March 11, 1861; Wikipedia)
