                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the first military drafts occurred during the American Civil War, in which both the Union and Confederate governments issued conscription laws.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P1'>The Confederacy, receiving fewer enlistments than it expected at the beginning of the war, passed the First Conscription Act in April 1862, rendering all able-bodied white males between the ages of 18 and 35 eligible to be compelled into military service, but it included a provision by which a draftee could hire a substitute or obtain an exemption. Fearing insurrections by the enslaved population, the Confederacy passed a Second Conscription Act in September 1862 exempting one white enslaver for every twenty enslaved persons on a property, also known as the "Twenty Slave Law". Both the substitute and twenty slave laws isolated impoverished white southerners and rendered the draft deeply unpopular among non-elite southerners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P2'>In the North, conscription began in July 1862 when Congress authorized the president to enlist any militia company into the United States' service. Conscription extended to the general public in March 1863 with the Enrollment Act, rendering any able-bodied white male citizen or immigrant between the ages of 20 and 45 subject to the draft. This law similarly included a provision allowing one to purchase a substitute or commutation for the then-sizeable fee of $300. Draftees could also be exempt by proving that they were the sole support of family members or other dependents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P3'>Many individuals in the North and South saw their respective drafts as affronts to the freedom and individual liberties upon which the United States was founded, while tensions also arose between those of different races, ethnicities, religions, and social classes that were differently represented in the draft. The draft also brought home the realities of war to many families, North and South, who relied on men to support them, as fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers were sent to fight, where they would make the little money paid to soldiers and possibly lose their lives. Conscription in the American Civil War led to the violence of the New York Draft Riots of July 1863, and resulted in widespread and varied resistance in North and South (Bill of Rights Institute).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD93403P0'>The Union and Confederacy allowed drafted men to supply another man to fight in their place, referred to as a military substitute. As this provision required capital, it led to the popular criticism that the war was a "rich man's war and a poor man's fight."
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93403P1'>Under Confederate conscription (or draft) laws, a draftee could hire another man who was exempt from the draft, often due to their age, trade/profession, or lack of citizenship, to serve in their place. Once arranged, they would pay a fee to the Confederate government and a large sum (typically ranging between $800–$1,500 but sometimes reaching as high as $3,000 specie) to the man serving in their place. While this practice was widespread, historians estimate between 50,000–150,000 men in Confederate service were military substitutes, it was publicly unpopular. In late 1863, the CSA Congress abolished substitution and in January 1864 a second act required that the men who had hired substitutes report for military duty. (Library of Congress; NCpedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93403P2'>The Union passed similar substitute provisions. When the US Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863, they similarly included a provision allowing draftees to permanently escape conscription by hiring a willing substitute to serve in their place. (National Park Service)
