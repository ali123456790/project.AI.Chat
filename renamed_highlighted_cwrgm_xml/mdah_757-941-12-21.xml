                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS76239P0'>William Samuel Patton was a politician and Confederate soldier from Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76239P1'>Born in Wayne County, Mississippi, on June 20, 1813, Patton attended LaGrange College in Georgia in the early 1830s and moved to Alabama afterwards. He became active in Alabama politics, winning election to the state legislature in 1844. Patton moved back to Mississippi in 1848 and quickly entered the political system. He was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1851, and almost immediately became speaker of the house.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76239P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Patton volunteered for Confederate service. He helped raise a company of volunteers and served in the Army of 10,000—a Mississippi militia organization of 60-day volunteers raised in the winter of 1861-1862 that saw garrison duty in Kentucky alongside the Confederate army. Afterwards, Patton was an officer in the Thirty-seventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment and ended the war at the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76239P3'>After the war, in 1865, Patton was briefly considered a candidate for governor of Mississippi, but afterwards largely stayed out of politics. He operated a hotel in Meridian, Mississippi, and was active in the Freemasons. Patton died on June 20, 1813. He was married to Frances Webb and had at least six children. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Meridian, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS102902P0'>Thomas Withers Caskey was a Christian pastor and Confederate soldier during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P1'>Born on January 12, 1816, in Maury County, Tennessee, Caskey moved to Mississippi as a young man and initially studied to become a Methodist preacher. In the late 1830s, he married Lucy Jones and the couple had seven children. Caskey found work as a blacksmith to support his growing family, and in 1841 the family moved to Alabama. In 1843, his wife passed away during childbirth. Distraught, Caskey turned back to his religious faith. He left the Methodist Church for the Church of Christ and took up full time ministry work. Caskey served as a traveling minister, preaching in Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Tennessee in the 1840s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P2'>In 1845, he married Harriet Elizabeth Foreman, and four years later he moved his family to Mississippi. Caskey’s fame as a preacher grew, and he reportedly served as one of the Church of Christ’s best orators and debaters, reportedly engaging in more than fifty public debates against representatives from other churches across the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P3'>When the Civil War broke out, Caskey volunteered for military service. He served as a chaplain for the Eighteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Caskey earned the nickname of the “Fighting Parson” for his willingness to join his unit on the front lines and even shooting at the enemy. However, he reportedly chose to only wound Union troops, for ethical reasons and, supposedly, because it weakened the opposing force even more by requiring one or two other soldiers to leave the fight to carry off their wounded comrade. Caskey also worked in Confederate hospitals, tending to the wounded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P4'>After the war, Caskey moved to Meridian, Mississippi. He continued preaching, and traveled frequently to Texas for evangelical and business purposes. Eventually he moved his family to Texas and became a practicing attorney, on the side of his preaching. He saw only moderate success in the legal profession, and eventually fell back on his preaching as a career.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102902P5'>Caskey died on August 10, 1896, while visiting family in Mississippi. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32118160P0'>Jehu Amaziah Orr was a representative of Mississippi in the Confederate States Congress during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P1'>Born on May 10, 1828, in Anderson County, South Carolina, he moved to Mississippi as a child. He graduated from Erskine College in South Carolina, before attending Princeton University in late 1840s. He left Princeton before graduation due to illness, but returned to earn a Master’s degree there in 1857. Orr became a prominent figure in Mississippi politics as a young man, being appointed as secretary to a Mississippi state convention on slavery in 1849, and later serving as secretary of the Mississippi Senate, a state representation, a district attorney, and then in 1861 being elected a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P2'>Once Mississippi joined the Confederacy, Orr won a seat representing Mississippi at the Confederate Provisional Congress in Montgomery, Alabama. In early 1862, he stepped away from politics to command the Thirty-First Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He led the unit through several battles, until 1864 when he returned to politics and took a seat in the Confederate House of Representatives, which he held until the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P3'>After the war Orr returned to practicing law. He served as judge of Mississippi’s Sixth Judicial District from 1869 to 1876, and then ran a very successful law firm, serving as the attorney for the Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad Company. He was married to Cornelia Ewing Van de Graaff and had four children. Late in his life, Orr became an outspoken supporter of women’s voting rights alongside his daughter Pauline Van de Graaff Orr, a notable suffragist. He was among the last surviving members of the Confederate Congress, and was widely praised in the early twentieth century for his more progressive views toward racial and social equality compared to his former Confederate colleagues.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25004269P0'>George Wythe Randolph was a Confederate general who served as the Secretary of War for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P1'>Born on March 10, 1818, at Monticello near Charlottesville, Virginia, Randolph was the grandson of former president Thomas Jefferson. He received a private education before attending school in Massachusetts and then Washington, D.C. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1831 and served until 1839, gaining experience at sea on vessels such as USS <hi rend='italic'>John Adams</hi> and USS <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>. While still in the Navy, Randolph began attending the University of Virginia and later studied law, becoming a practicing attorney in Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P2'>Following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Randolph was elected as a delegate to Virginia’s secession convention in early 1861. He spoke in favor of secession, but the convention ultimately rejected disunion during the first vote. Following Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion in the south, after Confederate troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, pro-secessionist sentiments grew in Virginia, and the convention passed a secessionist resolution. Randolph had been part of a Virginia militia artillery unit in the 1850s, nicknamed the “Richmond Howitzers.” Upon the state’s secession, the governor called the unit into state service, and Randolph was commissioned as a major. The unit manned artillery pieces in defensive locations along the James River and fired the first shot of the Civil War in Virginia on May 7, 1861, at a Union gunboat sailing up the river. In September 1861, Randolph was promoted to colonel in what was later renamed the First Regiment Virginia Artillery. On February 12, 1862, he was promoted again, this time to brigadier general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P3'>Only one month later, on March 18, 1862, Randolph was appointed Secretary of War of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. He served only eight months before resigning, in November 1862, due to health problems from tuberculosis that he contracted years before in the Navy. He recovered enough to take a seat as a Virginia state senator a few months later. However, Randolph sailed through the Union naval blockade in 1864 for medical treatment in Europe. He was still there when the war ended, and remained in Europe for another year afterward, finally taking the oath of allegiance to the United States in April 1866.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P4'>Randolph returned to Virginia, but died in April 1867 from complications of tuberculosis. He was married to Mary Elizabeth Adams, but had no children. Randolph is buried in the Monticello cemetery in Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS102543P0'>Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard was a U.S. Army officer, superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P1'>Born on a sugar plantation in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, on May 28, 1818, Beauregard was from a wealthy, slave owning Louisiana Creole family and grew up speaking French. He did not begin to learn English until attending a school in New York City at the age of twelve. Beauregard attended West Point and was an exceptional student, showing great aptitude in artillery and engineering. He graduated second in his class in 1838.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P2'>Beauregard served with distinction as a military engineer during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. He was brevetted (honorarily promoted) to captain for his performance at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco, and brevetted again to major for his actions at Chapultepec, where he was wounded in the shoulder and thigh. Following the Mexican-American War, Beauregard oversaw military engineering projects along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast. However, by 1856 he grew tired of peacetime service and nearly traveled to Nicaragua to take part in a revolution there being carried out by American volunteers. He was talked out of the effort by his Army colleagues, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott (who had personally seen Beauregard’s performances in Mexico). In January 1861, he secured an appointment as superintendent of West Point. However, he held the position for only five days before Louisiana’s secession prompted U.S. Army officials to revoke the orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P3'>Beauregard returned to New Orleans in early 1861 and joined the Confederate cause. Because of his previous service and reputation, he was quickly promoted, becoming the first Confederate general on March 1, 1861. His first assignment was command over defenses in Charleston, South Carolina. Federal soldiers there under Major Robert A. Anderson—one of Beauregard’s West Point instructors—occupied Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor and refused to relinquish the post without a fight. On April 12, 1861, Beauregard ordered Confederate cannons in Charleston to fire on Fort Sumter, and after a thirty-four hour bombardment Anderson surrendered. The attack upon U.S. Army troops sparked the Civil War, as it spurred President Abraham Lincoln to call for 75,000 volunteers to defeat southern secessionists and led to several other southern states to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P4'>After his victory at Fort Sumter, Beauregard received command of Confederate forces defending northern Virginia and successfully defeated a Union army under Brigadier General Irvin McDowell at the First Battle of Bull Run, near Manassas, Virginia, in July 1861. Despite these victories, Beauregard ran into controversy. He had a brash personality, and publicly criticized people like Confederate president Jefferson Davis; additionally, he bickered with some Confederate officials over strategy, his critics complaining his plans were overly complicated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P5'>In early 1862, Beauregard was transferred to the western theater where he became second-in-command of the Army of Mississippi under General Albert Sidney Johnston. The Confederates attacked Ulysses S. Grant’s army at Pittsburgh Landing along the Tennessee River in early April 1862. More famously known as the Battle of Shiloh, Beauregard took command of the Confederate forces after Johnston was mortally wounded. Despite initial success, Beauregard halted his men due to darkness only to withdraw the following day when Grant’s men were reinforced and counterattacked. Receiving criticism for retreating at Shiloh, Beauregard infuriated Confederate officials more when he abandoned the key railroad hub at Corinth, Mississippi, shortly afterwards. Although his withdrawal had been made to avoid being surrounded by a larger Union force, and because his army was suffering greatly from disease and contaminated water at Corinth, the dual retreats hurt Beauregard’s reputation. When he temporarily left his post for medical treatment, Jefferson Davis relieved him of command.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P6'>Beauregard’s next assignment was a return to Charleston to once against take over defenses of the southeastern Confederate coastline. He performed well, frustrating several Union assaults against Charleston Harbor. However, Beauregard believed his position was beneath his abilities. He interjected himself into political matters, proposing negotiations with federal officials and working behind the scenes to increase the number of Confederate troops in the west at the expense of General Robert E. Lee’s army in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P7'>In early 1864, Beauregard received orders to command Confederate defenses of North Carolina and southern Virginia. He performed very well in this role when Union armies under Ulysses S. Grant and Benjamin Butler maneuvered toward Richmond. Beauregard blocked Butler’s force and protected the key railroad center at Petersburg that summer. Meanwhile, William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army captured Atlanta, Georgia, prompting Confederate high command to shift command in the west. Beauregard was asked to command the new Department of the West, which covered a region from Georgia to the Mississippi River. While the position was not a field command, Beauregard took the opportunity as it placed him above several Confederate armies. The assignment proved difficult, as his troops in Tennessee suffered devastating defeats at Franklin and Nashville and scattered southern forces in Georgia and South Carolina failed to stop Sherman’s army from cutting through Georgia and South Carolina. When Beauregard repeatedly messaged Confederate officials in Richmond for help against Sherman, they relieved him of command and replaced him with Joseph E. Johnston. Unsurprisingly, Johnston fared no better and Confederate forces in the Carolinas were forced to surrender in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P8'>After the Civil War, Beauregard returned to New Orleans. He opposed Radical Reconstruction measures in the south, but less due to matters over Black civil rights and more regarding heavy property tax. Beauregard joined the Reform Party, generally made up of New Orleans businessmen who supported Black suffrage, and appealed to African American voters as an alternative to the Republican Party. He also took part in various business ventures, including railroads and cable car companies, civil engineering projects, and he served as the supervisor of the Louisiana State Lottery Company. He enjoyed substantial financial success from these activities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P9'>Beauregard was married twice during his lifetime. He married Marie Antoinette Laure Villere in 1841. The couple had three children, but Marie died during childbirth to the third in 1850. Beauregard then married Caroline Deslonde in 1860. She died only four years later after a long illness. Beauregard died on February 20, 1893. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P1'>Born in Barnard, Vermont, on February 9, 1809, Tupper was educated in the north and graduated from the University of Vermont before moving to Canton, Mississippi. He practiced law in Mississippi and became involved in newspaper publishing, running the <hi rend='italic'>Canton Herald</hi> in the 1830s. He became highly respected over the next two decades, serving as an advisor to Mississippi governor John J. Pettus during the secession crisis in 1860 and 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P2'>In 1862, Tupper received a commission as major general in the Mississippi militia, tasked with organizing and improving state forces at a time when most able-bodied Mississippi men who wanted to volunteer for military service were serving in the Confederate army. Tupper clashed with Pettus over the use of the state militia. He preferred to allow militia troops to return home following training and only be called into service during emergency situations. The governor wished to keep the militia units on active duty and in garrison. Additionally, Tupper resisted efforts by Confederate officials to control state military forces. In 1863, Tupper resigned his commission and spent the rest of the war at home.

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P1'>Born on January 4, 1824, in Smyrna, Tennessee, Barksdale moved to Mississippi as a young man and began work as a journalist.

In 1860, he was selected to be a delegate to the Democratic Party’s national convention in Charleston, South Carolina. He proved to be a dominant voice for southern slaveholding interests at the convention, and when the Democratic Party leaders ultimately sided with northern Democrat Senator Stephen A. Douglas’ principle of popular sovereignty (the people of the territories could choose the fate of slavery), Barksdale walked out of the convention in protest with delegates from seven southern states. The Charleston convention nominated Douglas as the party’s national candidate for the 1860 presidential election, while the southern Democrats who split from the convention held their own meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, and nominated John C. Breckenridge to more strongly defend southern interests in slavery.

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P2'>Barksdale returned to Mississippi to rally support for Breckenridge, and he advocated secession as a response to northern anti-slavery actions. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president, Barksdale was among those calling for Mississippi to separate from the Union. He served as one of Mississippi’s representatives in the Confederate Congress during the entire Civil War. One of his final policy efforts was a last-ditch effort to allow African Americans serve as soldiers in the Confederate army. The matter was initially supported by a small number of military and political figures, desperate to raise troops to combat the Union’s manpower superiority. It saw heavy resistance, but finally passed in the final weeks of the war, though it was never implemented.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P3'>After the Civil War, Barksdale remained active in Democratic politics, serving as a delegate to party conventions in 1868, 1872, and 1880. From 1877 to 1879, he was chairman of the Democratic state executive committee. Then, in 1882, after Reconstruction had collapse, Barksdale won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served two terms, but lost reelection in 1886. Upon leaving Congress, Barksdale retired to Yazoo County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P4'>Barksdale died on February 17, 1893, at the age of 69. He was married to Alice Jane Harris and had three children. Ethelbert Barksdale was also the younger brother of William Barksdale, a U.S. congressman who became general in the Confederate army, killed at Gettysburg in 1863. Ethelbert Barksdale is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS73091P0'>Mansfield Lovell was a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P1'>Born in Washington, D.C., on October 20, 1822, Lovell was related to some notable figures in early United States history. His father was surgeon general of the U.S. Army, and his great grandfather had been a member of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution. Lovell graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1842 and initially pursued a career with the U.S. Army. He fought in the Mexican-American War, receiving a brevet (honorary) promotion and a serious wound at the Battle of Chapultepec. After recovering from his injuries, he carried out a variety of assignments in the army until 1854, when he resigned to join a planned effort by some Americans to conquer Cuba. The plan fell apart, and Lovell moved to New York City where he took a job with the city administration.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Lovell traveled south to join the Confederacy. He was commissioned as an officer, quickly being promoted to major general in October 1861 and placed in command of Confederate forces at New Orleans, Louisiana. Lovell focused his defense of the city on from Union forces attacking overland from the north. When Union naval forces attacked the city from the south, sailing up the Mississippi River, Lovell was forced to abandon the city in early May 1862. The loss of the city to federal forces was one of the first major defeats for the Confederacy, and Lovell was vehemently criticized across the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P3'>He was then placed in command of a division under Major General Earl Van Dorn and participated in the Second Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, in October 1862. His performance was criticized, and he was relieved of command. With his reputation tarnished, mostly from the loss of New Orleans, Lovell requested a court of inquiry in hopes of justifying his previous command decisions. Indeed, the court found that he had not been guilty of any incompetence, but this did not result in any new military assignments during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P4'>After the war ended, Lovell took over a rice plantation near Savannah, Georgia. During his first year of farming, his crop was destroyed by a tidal wave, forcing him to abandon the endeavor. He moved to New York City and worked as a civil engineer and surveyor. Among his projects was clearing the East River for river traffic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P5'>Lovell died on October 20, 1822, in New York. He was married to Emily Maria Plympton and had one child. Lovell is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS75312P0'>Walter Goodman was a banker, railroad developer, and executive of the Mississippi Central Railroad in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75312P1'>Born on April 16, 1803, in New York City, New York, Goodman moved to Mississippi as a young man and entered the banking profession. He developed a reputation for integrity and good financial management, and was later employed by the American Land Company to manage the company’s holdings in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75312P2'>During the mid-nineteenth century, Goodman became interested in railroad development and in the early 1850s undertook an effort to establish a rail line to connect cotton planters and farmers in Mississippi and Tennessee to northern rail lines and railroad companies operating along the Gulf Coast. The project was named the Mississippi Central Railroad and was incorporated by the Mississippi government in 1852. Goodman was appointed president and he oversaw its construction during the 1850s, acquiring financing and even traveling to England to secure sufficient iron for construction. In 1860, the line was complete, becoming part of a rail line that connected the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes. Goodman continued to manage the railroad during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75312P3'>Shortly after the war, Goodman left the railroad company and went into business in New York with his brother-in-law, Dr. A. F. Merrill. Then, on April 16, 1866, Goodman died of liver failure at Merrill’s home in New York. He was married to Anna Merrill and had at least one child that survived to adulthood.  Goodman is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS86445P0'>Braxton Bragg was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P1'>Born on March 22, 1817, in Warrenton, North Carolina, Bragg attended the prestigious Warrenton Male Academy as a young teenager and then entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, at the age of 16. He performed well at the academy, reportedly due to an exceptional memory and good discipline, and graduated in 1837. His first military assignment was in Florida during the Second Seminole War, but he served as a commissary officer and adjutant, seeing no combat. He later commanded a company of the Third United States Artillery and was stationed at St. Augustine, Florida, and then Fort Moultrie outside of Charleston, South Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P2'>During his first few years of service, Bragg quarreled with other officers and proved outspoken. He wrote a series of essays in the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Literary Messenger</hi> criticizing army leadership. For this he was court martialed upon charges of disobedience and received an official reprimand and temporary suspension of rank. Despite this punishment, Bragg continued to be argumentative. This trait, along with his propensity for strict discipline and obedience to regulations, made him unpopular and the target of stories and rumors among fellow officers. In his memoirs, Ulysses S. Grant, who knew Bragg at West Point and in the Army in the 1840s, recalled hearing of an incident in which Bragg served as a company commander at an Army post, and was made acting quartermaster while his another officer was on detached duty. As company commander, Bragg submitted a formal request for supplies from the quartermaster’s office. As acting quartermaster, he rejected his own request, with a written note on the order explaining his reasons. Bragg, in his role as company commander, protested that his supply request was appropriate, to which he, as acting quartermaster, again rejected the request a second time. Bragg then elevated the matter to the post commander, who reportedly exclaimed, “My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled [<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>] with every officer in the army, and now you are quarrelling with yourself!” While possibly apocryphal, the story reflected Bragg’s reputation among his army colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P3'>Bragg’s performance during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, boosted his army career and reputation. He earned repeated promotions for bravery. His obsession with discipline served the American army well, as his troops were among the best trained on the battlefield. He was brevetted (honorarily promoted) to captain after the Battle of Fort Brown in May 1846, brevetted to major after the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846, and then again to lieutenant colonel after Buena Vista in February 1847. His actions at Buena Vista were especially celebrated, as Bragg positioned his artillery at a key gap in the American line and repulsed a larger Mexican force. Among those who admired Bragg’s actions during the battle was Jefferson Davis, who commanded a Mississippi regiment, but later became secretary of war for the United States and then president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P4'>In 1849, Bragg married Eliza Brooks Ellis, the daughter of a wealthy sugar planter from Louisiana. She followed Bragg to his next military assignments, but by 1855 the couple chose to pursue a life outside of the army. Bragg resigned from the army in 1856 and he and his wife purchased a massive sugar plantation in Louisiana. He managed the sugar cultivation and production with the same adherence to discipline, overseeing more than one hundred slaves on the property. He became active in Louisiana affairs, receiving an appointment as colonel in the Louisiana militia. Bragg initially opposed talk of secession in the south, but followed Louisiana into the Confederacy. He received a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate army in March 1861 and was promoted to major general in September 1861. His first assignment involved commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida. Later, he was transferred to the Army of Mississippi where he commanded a corps under Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P5'>Bragg’s first major engagement during the Civil War was Shiloh, Tennessee, in April 1862. Although Confederate forces were forced to retreat, Bragg performed well at the battle and received a promotion to full general in the Confederacy Army only a week afterwards. He was given command of the Army of Mississippi, renamed the Army of Tennessee. His performance as an army commander afterwards in 1862 and 1863 had mixed results. At battles like Murfreesboro and Chickamauga, Bragg scored early tactical victories but failed to defeat his Union opponents. His brash personality and quarrelsome behavior aggravated subordinates, who called for his removal. However Jefferson Davis remained committed to Bragg and kept him in command of Confederate troops in Tennessee until November 1863, when Bragg offered his resignation following the Confederate defeat at Chattanooga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P6'>Even without a field command, Bragg remained a powerful military figure in the Confederacy. He served as an advisor to Davis and proved an able administrator for the Confederate prison system and medical system. In late 1864, he temporarily commanded Confederate troops in the Carolinas and Georgia coastline. Initially successful, a Union victory at Wilmington, North Carolina, in early 1865 undermined his standing, and he spent the final months commanding a corps commander under Joseph E. Johnston. He surrendered to Union forces in early May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P7'>Bragg’s sugar plantation had been confiscated by federal troops during the Civil War, leaving Bragg and his wife homeless at the end of the war. The couple briefly lived in Alabama, but moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1867 where Bragg became superintendent of the New Orleans waterworks. When he lost his job to a Republican appointee, Bragg received an offer from former Confederate president Jefferson Davis to work for the Carolina Life Insurance Company.

<p xml:id='OTPS99941P1'>Born in Tennessee on August 10, 1810, Neill moved to Carroll County, Mississippi, as a young man and became a successful attorney and planter. He served in the Mexican War and afterwards successfully ran for public office, serving in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1850 to 1852 and in the Mississippi Senate from 1857 to 1862. In April 1862 he volunteered for military service, was commissioned colonel, and placed into command of the Thirtieth Mississippi Infantry Regiment.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS103328P0'>Edward Cary Walthall was a Confederate general, attorney, and politician from Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS103328P1'>Born on April 4, 1831, in Richmond, Virginia, Walthall moved to Mississippi as a child with his family. He was educated at St. Thomas Hall, a military boys school in Holly Springs, and then studied law. Walthall became a practicing attorney in 1852, and later that decade served as district attorney in Mississippi’s tenth judicial district.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS103328P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Walthall volunteered for military service. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Fifteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, but was quickly promoted to lieutenant colonel. After seeing combat at the Battle of Mill Springs in early 1862, he took command of the Twenty-ninth Mississippi Infantry Regiment as a colonel and participated in the Battle of Corinth. Walthall continued to be promoted, being placed in charge of a brigade in the Army of Tennessee in late 1862 and made brigadier general a few weeks later. He performed well at several battles, including Missionary Ridge where he was wounded and captured (but released during a prisoner exchange), and at Resaca where he was wounded again. Walthall continued to lead Confederate troops in the western theater, eventually surrendering with Joseph E. Johnston’s army in North Carolina in late April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS103328P3'>Walthall returned to Mississippi after the Civil War and resumed practicing law in Coffeeville. He then moved to Grenada in 1871 and operated a successful law firm. In 1885, he received an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy by the departure of Lucius Q. C. Lamar. Walthall won his own election to the seat in 1889. He resigned from the Senate in January 1894 due to poor health, but won reelection later than year and returned to Washington, D.C., in 1895. He served as a senator until his death on April 21, 1898.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS103328P4'>Walthall was married twice. His first wife, Sophie, died in 1855. His second wife was Mary Leckie. He had at least one child, a son that did not survive infancy. Walthall is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS84072P0'>Absolom Madden West was a Confederate general, a Mississippi politician, railroad executive, and vice presidential candidate. Born in Alabama in 1818, West moved to Mississippi around 1837 to establish a plantation with property he acquired from federal land grants. He entered Mississippi state politics as a Whig and won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1847. He married Caroline O. Glover in the 1840s and the couple had four surviving children, born between 1849 and 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P1'>In 1853, he took an office job with the new Mississippi Central Railroad, gaining experience not only in railroad development but corporate and logistical operations. As a Whig, West originally opposed secession. However, after Mississippi left the Union in 1861, during the secession crisis that split the country following Abraham Lincon’s election to president in November 1860, West offered his loyalty and services to the state. He was promoted a brigadier general in the Mississippi state militia, and helped raised a regiment of volunteers. Recognizing his skill and experience in administrative and logistical work, state officials appointed him to several different managerial roles, such as quartermaster general, paymaster general, and commissary general of the militia. He made recommendations to the state legislature to improve the accounting of funds, and was the only state officer to have his accounting books in order and submitted at the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P2'>West took the role of president over the Mississippi Central Railroad around 1864. He remained in that position until around the end of the war, then returned to state politics—again serving in the Mississippi Senate—after the Illinois Central purchased the Mississippi Central. West was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the early effort by the Mississippi government in 1865 to earn readmission to the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, he was among the Mississippi delegation refused seats in Congress when Republicans in Washington, D.C., objected to Mississippi’s “Black Codes”—a series of highly discriminatory laws passed in the summer of 1865 to restrict the civil rights of African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P3'>West became involved in labor rights during Reconstruction, helping form a branch of the National Labor Union. Reentering the Mississippi Senate in the early 1870s, around 1876 he broke away from the Democratic Party and joined the emerging “Greenback Party”—an independent, anti-monopoly political party. It united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters, namely the expansion of paper currency believed to help farmers and small businesses. Attesting to the party’s ability to bring former enemies together, the party’s national convention in 1884 nominated former Union general Benjamin Butler (who had been despised within the Confederacy during his occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War) for its presidential candidate and the former Confederate militia general West as vice president. The party polled only a 1.7% of the popular vote in 1884.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P4'>West’s wife Caroline died in 1889 after a long bout of poor health. He died five years later, in 1894.  The couple is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P0'>The United States during the nineteenth century saw great increases in literacy and general education. At the beginning of that century, approximately 70 percent of northerners and 60 percent of white southerners could read. By 1840, that number increased to roughly 93 percent of northerners and 80 percent of white southerners. (African American literacy rates were far lower, particularly in the south where many states had laws against teaching slaves and free Black people to read.) After the Civil War, literacy rates continued to rise, most drastically with freed people. In 1870, approximately 20 percent of Black Americans knew how to read. Due to new educational opportunities after emancipation—and despite the lack of support provided to Black schools by many discriminatory local governments—that number nearly tripled within thirty years, with 55 percent of African Americans being literate by 1900.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P1'>The general improvement of literacy and education in the United States spurred an increasing demand for printed information. At the same time, technological developments—such as improved paper production, better transportation and trade routes for the sale of paper and printing supplies, higher quality and faster printing machines, and rapid transmission of information through railroads and eventually telegraph—contributed to a boom in print media. This allowed aspiring newspaper editors to open their own publication in even small towns. In 1830, the United States had around 900 newspapers in publication (nearly double the number found in Great Britain at the same time). Only ten years later, more than 1,600 newspapers were in circulation; and in 1850 that number had grown to more than 2,500. In 1900, there were more than 20,000 American newspapers. Most were weekly publications, but the number of daily newspapers rose from 24 in 1820 to more than 250 in 1850, to more than 2,600 in 1900. Still, the annual numbers of newspapers mentioned above underrepresent the proliferation of print media activity, since they only include active newspaper companies counted during a formal census. Many newspapers lasted only a few months or years, before being replaced or purchased by a competitor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P2'>The nineteenth century also saw drastic improvement in the quality of mass production printing and book binding. This decreased the cost associated with manufacturing books, increased opportunities for writers to publish their work, and improved the amount of printed material for schools and professional organizations outside of the traditional cities and universities. It also increased the role of books as entertainment, rather than their previous primary purpose as sources of religious and academic information.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P3'>Technological developments greatly improved illustration printing during the nineteenth century. Lithography—a technique of transferring an image from a smooth piece of limestone to paper—had been invented in the 1790s in Bavaria. Over the next century, printers and publishers refined the technique to mass produce increasingly elaborate illustrations, including in color. The process still required an artist to produce, or reproduce, an image on limestone or specially prepared metal plate. However, average Americans were able to purchase highly decorative prints, books, calendars, and magazines. Lithography also revolutionized advertising during the latter part of the nineteenth century, as printers could produce elaborate advertisements for stores and other businesses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P4'>Overall, the nineteenth century was a sort of golden era of print media. While printing and publishing continued to be a vital part of American culture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the invention of radio, television, and the internet reduced Americans’ reliance upon paper-based newspapers, magazines, and books for information and entertainment.
