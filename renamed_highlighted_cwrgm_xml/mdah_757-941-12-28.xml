                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS102543P0'>Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard was a U.S. Army officer, superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P1'>Born on a sugar plantation in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, on May 28, 1818, Beauregard was from a wealthy, slave owning Louisiana Creole family and grew up speaking French. He did not begin to learn English until attending a school in New York City at the age of twelve. Beauregard attended West Point and was an exceptional student, showing great aptitude in artillery and engineering. He graduated second in his class in 1838.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P2'>Beauregard served with distinction as a military engineer during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. He was brevetted (honorarily promoted) to captain for his performance at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco, and brevetted again to major for his actions at Chapultepec, where he was wounded in the shoulder and thigh. Following the Mexican-American War, Beauregard oversaw military engineering projects along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast. However, by 1856 he grew tired of peacetime service and nearly traveled to Nicaragua to take part in a revolution there being carried out by American volunteers. He was talked out of the effort by his Army colleagues, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott (who had personally seen Beauregard’s performances in Mexico). In January 1861, he secured an appointment as superintendent of West Point. However, he held the position for only five days before Louisiana’s secession prompted U.S. Army officials to revoke the orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P3'>Beauregard returned to New Orleans in early 1861 and joined the Confederate cause. Because of his previous service and reputation, he was quickly promoted, becoming the first Confederate general on March 1, 1861. His first assignment was command over defenses in Charleston, South Carolina. Federal soldiers there under Major Robert A. Anderson—one of Beauregard’s West Point instructors—occupied Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor and refused to relinquish the post without a fight. On April 12, 1861, Beauregard ordered Confederate cannons in Charleston to fire on Fort Sumter, and after a thirty-four hour bombardment Anderson surrendered. The attack upon U.S. Army troops sparked the Civil War, as it spurred President Abraham Lincoln to call for 75,000 volunteers to defeat southern secessionists and led to several other southern states to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P4'>After his victory at Fort Sumter, Beauregard received command of Confederate forces defending northern Virginia and successfully defeated a Union army under Brigadier General Irvin McDowell at the First Battle of Bull Run, near Manassas, Virginia, in July 1861. Despite these victories, Beauregard ran into controversy. He had a brash personality, and publicly criticized people like Confederate president Jefferson Davis; additionally, he bickered with some Confederate officials over strategy, his critics complaining his plans were overly complicated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P5'>In early 1862, Beauregard was transferred to the western theater where he became second-in-command of the Army of Mississippi under General Albert Sidney Johnston. The Confederates attacked Ulysses S. Grant’s army at Pittsburgh Landing along the Tennessee River in early April 1862. More famously known as the Battle of Shiloh, Beauregard took command of the Confederate forces after Johnston was mortally wounded. Despite initial success, Beauregard halted his men due to darkness only to withdraw the following day when Grant’s men were reinforced and counterattacked. Receiving criticism for retreating at Shiloh, Beauregard infuriated Confederate officials more when he abandoned the key railroad hub at Corinth, Mississippi, shortly afterwards. Although his withdrawal had been made to avoid being surrounded by a larger Union force, and because his army was suffering greatly from disease and contaminated water at Corinth, the dual retreats hurt Beauregard’s reputation. When he temporarily left his post for medical treatment, Jefferson Davis relieved him of command.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P6'>Beauregard’s next assignment was a return to Charleston to once against take over defenses of the southeastern Confederate coastline. He performed well, frustrating several Union assaults against Charleston Harbor. However, Beauregard believed his position was beneath his abilities. He interjected himself into political matters, proposing negotiations with federal officials and working behind the scenes to increase the number of Confederate troops in the west at the expense of General Robert E. Lee’s army in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P7'>In early 1864, Beauregard received orders to command Confederate defenses of North Carolina and southern Virginia. He performed very well in this role when Union armies under Ulysses S. Grant and Benjamin Butler maneuvered toward Richmond. Beauregard blocked Butler’s force and protected the key railroad center at Petersburg that summer. Meanwhile, William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army captured Atlanta, Georgia, prompting Confederate high command to shift command in the west. Beauregard was asked to command the new Department of the West, which covered a region from Georgia to the Mississippi River. While the position was not a field command, Beauregard took the opportunity as it placed him above several Confederate armies. The assignment proved difficult, as his troops in Tennessee suffered devastating defeats at Franklin and Nashville and scattered southern forces in Georgia and South Carolina failed to stop Sherman’s army from cutting through Georgia and South Carolina. When Beauregard repeatedly messaged Confederate officials in Richmond for help against Sherman, they relieved him of command and replaced him with Joseph E. Johnston. Unsurprisingly, Johnston fared no better and Confederate forces in the Carolinas were forced to surrender in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P8'>After the Civil War, Beauregard returned to New Orleans. He opposed Radical Reconstruction measures in the south, but less due to matters over Black civil rights and more regarding heavy property tax. Beauregard joined the Reform Party, generally made up of New Orleans businessmen who supported Black suffrage, and appealed to African American voters as an alternative to the Republican Party. He also took part in various business ventures, including railroads and cable car companies, civil engineering projects, and he served as the supervisor of the Louisiana State Lottery Company. He enjoyed substantial financial success from these activities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P9'>Beauregard was married twice during his lifetime. He married Marie Antoinette Laure Villere in 1841. The couple had three children, but Marie died during childbirth to the third in 1850. Beauregard then married Caroline Deslonde in 1860. She died only four years later after a long illness. Beauregard died on February 20, 1893. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53940P0'>William H. Brown was a court clerk, state militia officer, and public official in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53940P1'>Born in 1815 in New York, Brown moved to Hinds County, Mississippi, as a young man. By 1850 he was a clerk in the U.S. district court, a job he held for at least a decade. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Brown was commissioned a colonel and appointed adjutant general of the Mississippi militia, responsible for many administrative duties over the state’s troops. After the war, Brown was appointed Deputy Auditor of Public Accounts. He held that position until his death on December 4, 1873. He was married to Martha Bingham of Mississippi, and had at least one child that survived to adulthood. Brown is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
