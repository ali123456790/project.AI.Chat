                    <p xml:id='OTPS72945P0'>John Jones McRae was a lawyer and statesman from Mississippi who served in the Mississippi House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, as the 21st Governor of Mississippi, and the Confederate Congress.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P1'>McRae was born on January 10, 1815 in Sneedsboro (present-day McFarlan), Anson County, North Carolina. At age two, his family moved to Winchester, Wayne County, Mississippi in 1817 and later to Pascagoula, Jackson County, Mississippi in 1827. He attended the University of Miami in Ohio, graduating in 1834. McRae returned to Mississippi to study law at Pearlington. He was admitted to the bar in 1835 and began practicing law in Paulding, Mississippi. In October 1835 he married Mary Annette McGuire, and the couple had three children together. He founded the newspaper <hi rend='italic'>Eastern Clarion</hi> in 1837.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P2'>McRae’s political career began when he was elected as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1847, serving as Speaker of the House in 1850. He was appointed to the United States Senate from December 19, 1851 until March 17, 1852 to serve the remainder of Jefferson Davis’s unexpired term when he resigned to run for Governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P3'>In 1853 McRae was elected as the 21st Governor of Mississippi under the Democratic States’ Rights platform. He was reelected in 1855. During his time in the Governorship McRae’s administration oversaw the opening of the state’s first mental hospital and established an asylum for the deaf and speechless. He also oversaw the State’s levy program in the Delta and signed the Mississippi Code of 1857 into law. McRae was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1858 following the death of Congressman John A. Quitman. He served in Congress until January 12, 1861, resigning his seat three days after Mississippi seceded from the Union. He was elected to the Confederate Congress and served from 1862 to 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P4'>McRae was not involved in public affairs after the Civil War. His wife Mary died in 1866. In 1868 he sailed to Belize (present-day Belize City), British Honduras (Present-day Belize) to visit his brother. While there he died unexpectedly on May 31, 1868. He is buried at Lord Ridge Cemetery, Belize City, Belize.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74237P0'>Ethelbert Barksdale served in the Confederate States Congress from Mississippi during the Civil War and later represented Mississippi in the U.S. Congress after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P1'>Born on January 4, 1824, in Smyrna, Tennessee, Barksdale moved to Mississippi as a young man and began work as a journalist. He served as editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Yazoo City Democrat</hi> in the 1840s and in 1850 moved to Jackson to run the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippian</hi>, a Democratic Party newspaper. In 1860, he was selected to be a delegate to the Democratic Party’s national convention in Charleston, South Carolina. He proved to be a dominant voice for southern slaveholding interests at the convention, and when the Democratic Party leaders ultimately sided with northern Democrat Senator Stephen A. Douglas’ principle of popular sovereignty (the people of the territories could choose the fate of slavery), Barksdale walked out of the convention in protest with delegates from seven southern states. The Charleston convention nominated Douglas as the party’s national candidate for the 1860 presidential election, while the southern Democrats who split from the convention held their own meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, and nominated John C. Breckenridge to more strongly defend southern interests in slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P2'>Barksdale returned to Mississippi to rally support for Breckenridge, and he advocated secession as a response to northern anti-slavery actions. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president, Barksdale was among those calling for Mississippi to separate from the Union. He served as one of Mississippi’s representatives in the Confederate Congress during the entire Civil War. One of his final policy efforts was a last-ditch effort to allow African Americans serve as soldiers in the Confederate army. The matter was initially supported by a small number of military and political figures, desperate to raise troops to combat the Union’s manpower superiority. It saw heavy resistance, but finally passed in the final weeks of the war, though it was never implemented.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P3'>After the Civil War, Barksdale remained active in Democratic politics, serving as a delegate to party conventions in 1868, 1872, and 1880. From 1877 to 1879, he was chairman of the Democratic state executive committee. Then, in 1882, after Reconstruction had collapse, Barksdale won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served two terms, but lost reelection in 1886. Upon leaving Congress, Barksdale retired to Yazoo County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P4'>Barksdale died on February 17, 1893, at the age of 69. He was married to Alice Jane Harris and had three children. Ethelbert Barksdale was also the younger brother of William Barksdale, a U.S. congressman who became general in the Confederate army, killed at Gettysburg in 1863. Ethelbert Barksdale is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
