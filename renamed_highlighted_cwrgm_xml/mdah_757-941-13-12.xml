                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53994P0'>Albert Gallatin Brown was governor of Mississippi, a U.S. congressman and senator from Mississippi, and a member of the Confederate Senate. Born on May 31, 1813, in South Carolina, Brown moved with his family to Mississippi in 1823. Over the course of ten years, Brown’s family established a cotton plantation that contained 1,600 acres of land and 23 slaves. He attended Mississippi College and Jefferson College, and studied law to become a practicing attorney in 1834. A year later, he entered politics, winning a seat in Mississippi’s House of Representatives in 1835 and then serving in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1839 to 1841. He was a judge in Mississippi’s Circuit Superior Court from 1842 to 1843 and then, at the age of 31, won Mississippi’s gubernatorial election in 1843 as a Democrat. Brown was a staunch advocate of public education and successfully established the University of Mississippi, which opened in 1848.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P1'>Brown left the governor’s mansion in 1848 and returned to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served there until winning a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1854. He was an outspoken defender of slavery in Washington, D.C., in the latter half of the 1850s, even advocating the expansion of American slavery to Central America. When Mississippi seceded in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Brown resigned his seat in the Senate and returned to Mississippi to organize a militia company. He led his unit to Virginia, but was shortly afterwards elected to represent Mississippi in the Confederate Senate. He remained a member there until the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P2'>Brown was among a small number of Confederate officials who foresaw the fall of the Confederacy in the wake of the battlefield defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. He unsuccessfully recommended a negotiated settlement with the Union. When the war ended in 1865, Brown took a more reconciliatory stance to Reconstruction than many other former Confederates, recommending that the south accept emancipation. Despite having a political career during a controversial and dangerous period in American history, Brown was described as being among the most amicable and fair public figures, refusing to castigate or criticize his political opponents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P3'>After the Civil War, Brown left public life. He practiced law in Mississippi for the next fifteen years. Brown was married twice during his life, first to Elizabeth Frances Thornton Taliaferro, who died less than a year after their wedding. His second wife was Roberta Eugenia Young. The couple had one child.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P4'>Brown died of a stroke on June 12, 1880, at home in Mississippi. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94831P0'>Martial law is the temporary replacement of civilian government by military authorities, often in response to an emergency. The American Civil War and Reconstruction Era saw several examples of military authorities implementing martial law. These efforts were less controversial when Union commanders imposed military authority over occupied Confederate communities, but generated great concern when they affected people in areas that had not formally seceded. For example, in 1861, Union general John C. Frémont declared martial law in Missouri in August 1861. His declaration further inflamed tensions because it announced the emancipation of enslaved people enslaved by pro-secession Missourians. Despite having a substantial pro-secessionist population, the state was still officially part of the Union. President Abraham Lincoln overturned Frémont’s order.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94831P1'>Many examples of martial law during the Civil War involved arresting and detaining individuals that federal authorities feared would be released by local courts antagonistic to the federal government’s military objectives. Lincoln proclaimed martial law in September 1862 in order to arrest and prosecute in military tribunals people accused of rebelling against federal authority, discouraging army enlistments, resisting militia drafts, or aiding Confederates. Republicans in Congress backed the president and passed legislation to authorize his suspension of some civil liberties. These measures received severe criticism from Democrats, and in the case <hi rend='italic'>Ex Parte Milligan</hi>, the Supreme Court ruled against the Lincoln Administration’s use martial law in areas where the civilian government and courts were functional.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94831P2'>Confederate officials also declared martial law during the Civil War. Confederate president Jefferson Davis imposed martial law over portions of Virginia in February and March 1862, in anticipation of civil disturbances and emergencies resulting from the Union Army’s advance to Richmond. Later, Davis extended martial law over eastern Tennessee and parts of South Carolina, to crack down on anti-Confederate activities within pro-Union communities. Confederate military commanders followed suit, including Major General Earl Van Dorn’s declaration of martial law in Mississippi in 1862. These efforts received fierce criticism, particularly as Confederate fortunes in the war faded. Davis’s opponents argued that martial law and the suspension of the writ of <hi rend='italic'>habeas corpus</hi> strengthened the Confederate government’s power at the expense of states rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94831P3'>Examples of martial law continued after the Civil War. During Reconstruction in 1867, in response to efforts by former Confederates to suppress African American civil rights, the U.S. Congress passed the Military Reconstruction Act, which placed the former Confederate states under martial law and divided them into military districts. The act declared that the states could reenter the Union and regain their civilian governments after they ratified the Fourteenth Amendment protecting the rights of black Southerners. Federal military authorities continued to govern, or intercede in local matters, in parts of the South until the end of Reconstruction in 1877. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
