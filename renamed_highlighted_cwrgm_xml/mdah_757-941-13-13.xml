                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25005902P0'>Benjamin Franklin Butler was a lawyer, U.S. Representative, major general in the U.S. Army during the Civil War, and Governor of Massachusetts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P1'>Born on November 5, 1818 in Deerfield, Rockingham County, New Hampshire, Butler moved to Lowell, Massachusetts with his family in 1828. In 1840, he became a lawyer and opened a law firm in Lowell, where he became a prominent defense lawyer and was a specialist in bankruptcy law. He was so successful that he opened up a second practice in Boston and purchased shares in Lowell’s Middlesex Mill Company. Butler was also a member of the state militia, carrying the rank of brigadier general just before the Civil War. A member of the Democratic Party, Butler opposed the abolitionist movement, and he became a Massachusetts state representative in 1852, serving one term. In 1858, he was elected to the state senate. He also unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1859 and 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P2'>During the Civil War, Butler secured a contract with the state of Massachusetts for his mill to supply heavy cloth to the militia, guaranteeing himself significant profits. He also was appointed brigadier general of the state militia and was sent to Maryland with the 8th Volunteer Massachusetts (militia) to help secure the state. Afterwards, he was appointed major general of the volunteer forces and was sent to the Department of Virginia. There, he established a precedent for the U.S. Army by refusing to return fugitive slaves to their enslavers, claiming that they were contraband of war. Lincoln supported the argument, and the policy eventually became standard U.S. policy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P3'>On June 10, 1861, Butler suffered an embarrassing defeat at the Battle of Big Bethel, and his command was reduced in size. But, he found more success in North Carolina and was assigned to command ground troops in Louisiana in November. In May 1862, Butler commanded the troops that took New Orleans after the U.S. Navy defeated the Confederates at Forts Jackson and St. Philip south of the city.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P4'>Among Confederates, Butler became infamous as the military governor of New Orleans. On May 15, 1862, he issued General Order No. 28, which was a response to the verbal and physical abuse U.S. officers and soldiers had experienced at the hands of “respectable” women in New Orleans. This included women spitting in the faces of U.S. soldiers, pouring chamber pots filled with human excrement on men on patrol, and even an incident involving U.S. Naval commander Admiral David Farragut in which a woman poured urine on his head. General Order No. 28 declared that any woman who insulted or showed contempt for an officer or soldier of the U.S. would be treated as a “woman of the town plying her avocation” (as a sex worker). This earned him the nicknames “Beast Butler” and “Butler the Beast.” Butler also seized cotton from those who failed to pledge their loyalty to the U.S. both in the city and in the surrounding areas. The cotton was auctioned at low prices, and his brother Andrew was often the buyer. Other acts included censoring New Orleans newspapers and executing William Mumford, who tore down a U.S. flag that had been placed on the U.S. Mint in New Orleans. Mumford had dragged the flag through the streets, where it was spit on, trampled on, and torn into pieces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P5'>Butler did also provide relief for the poor and implemented strict quarantines that protected the city from yellow fever. Northerners saw his governance as an appropriately firm stance against Confederates. In September 1862, he also formed the 1st Louisiana Native Guard, which was the first Black regiment in the U.S. Army, and he commissioned thirty Black officers to command the unit, whereas most Black regiments were commanded by white officers. However, Lincoln authorized Butler’s recall in December 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P6'>Afterwards, Butler joined the Republican Party, and in November 1863, he became the commander of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina. By May 1864, his forces were called the Army of the James. This included several regiments of the U.S. Colored Troops (USCT), and he awarded the Medal of Honor to several Black men of the 38th USCT. He also created a special medal for meritorious service which he awarded to another two hundred Black men. This was later named the Butler Medal. As commander of the Army of the James, Butler also had an opportunity to take Petersburg in May 1864, which may have forced the Confederates to surrender a year early. But he hesitated, allowing the Confederates to build up a more substantial force. As in New Orleans, Butler’s command was also tarnished by financial scandal and even of trade with the Confederacy. However, his popularity with the Radical Republicans and concerns that he might run for the presidency ensured he did not lose his position in the army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P7'>In December 1864, Butler suffered another embarrassment in which he deemed Fort Fisher in North Carolina impregnable. The U.S. Army captured the fort a week later without Butler in command. On January 8, 1865, with Lincoln’s reelection to the presidency secure, U.S. General Ulysses S. Grant relieved Butler of his command.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P8'>Between his mills in Lowell and his time in New Orleans, Butler was enormously wealthy after the war, but he returned to his law practice, expanding his firm to include offices in New York City and Washington D.C. He was the defense attorney in some of the most prominent cases in the years immediately following the war. In 1866, he was also elected U.S. Representative on a platform of civil rights, serving through 1875 and again 1877 to 1879. Butler was an opponent to U.S. President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, and he was an early advocate for impeaching the President. He was elected by the House to serve as one of the prosecutors in the impeachment trial. The impeachment failed by a single vote.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P9'>In 1882, Butler was elected Governor of Massachusetts, serving one term from 1883 to 1884. By this point, he had rejoined the Democratic Party. After his term, he made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Presidency, and by 1892, he published his memoir <hi rend='italic'>Butler’s Book</hi>.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P10'>Butler was married to Sarah Jones (Hildreth) Butler, who preceded him in death in 1876. The pair had two sons and one daughter who lived to adulthood. His daughter was Blanche (Butler) Ames, who was the wife of Mississippi Governor Adelbert Ames. Benjamin Franklin Butler died on January 11, 1893 in Washington D.C. and was buried in the Hildreth Family Cemetery in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005903P0'>Union General Order No. 28 (1862) was issued by the commander of the Department of the Gulf, Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, on May 15, 1862 in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was a response to hostile actions by the women of New Orleans toward officers and soldiers of the Army. It ordered that any woman by word, gesture, insult movement, or show of contempt toward Army personnel be treated as ‘woman of the town plying her avocation’ to be held liable for their actions. The order was one of the contributing factors of Maj. Genl. Benjamin Butler’s removal from command in New Orleans on December 16, 1862.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD87503P0'>Confederate irregulars, or guerrillas, were fighters engaged in warfare outside of the formal army structure. Their organizational methods varied, from loose bands of individuals to self-named units under a semi-formal command system. Celebrated by some Southerners during the Civil War as local defense forces, guerrilla fighters were most known for engaging in non-conventional tactics, such as conducting raids and ambushes, destroying supplies, intimidating civilians, and engaging in activities contrary to laws or etiquette of conventional warfare.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD87503P1'>The most famous examples of guerrilla, or irregular, fighters in the Confederacy occurred in the border states of Missouri and Tennessee, where the civilian populations were split on the topic of secession, fostering political and military strife within those communities. However, as Union armies advanced into the Confederacy and captured secessionist communities, guerrilla activity increased and spread across much of the South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD87503P2'>Confederate and Southern state officials had a tenuous relationship with pro-secessionist irregular fighters during the Civil War. While ostensibly sharing the same political interests, and providing some tactical value to areas that lacked a large formal Confederate army presence, guerrilla operations frequently contradicted the objectives of Confederate political and military leaders. Southern civilians were often caught between Confederate guerrillas and Union soldiers, suffering harsher treatment from vengeful federals and even falling victim to criminal activity by the irregular fighters themselves. Although guerrilla activity continued throughout the Civil War, Confederate leaders, such as General Robert E. Lee, formally opposed irregular warfare in the face of defeat, largely due to its negative implications on society and reconciliation. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.
