                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P0'>Cotton is a native plant to the Americas which produces puffy bolls of soft white fibers used for clothing and fabric production since the prehistoric era. There are two main species of cotton—distinguished primarily by their fiber length. Short staple cotton has shorter fibers but can grow across a broader geographical area in the southern United States. Long staple cotton is considered by many to produce higher quality, softer fibers, but is more tropical and frost sensitive, isolating it to the warm coastal areas of the lower south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P1'>Long staple cotton became a highly prized cash crop for seventeenth and eighteenth century farmers in the lower south, particularly along the South Carolina and Georgia coastline. Sea Island cotton was carefully cultivated and developed by planters who imported long fiber plants from Central and South America to improve the quality. This lucrative crop was labor intensive, requiring laborers to pick the bolls by hand—a task increasingly given to enslaved people. Once collected, the cotton bolls had to be processed to remove seeds so the fibers could be spun into thread and the seeds used for planting or for cottonseed oil production. Early American cotton planters used a simple cotton gin (or cotton engine), originally designed in India in the fifth century, to mechanically separate seeds from the long staple fibers. This basic gin did not work with short fiber cotton. Because of this, short staple cotton was not a popular crop during the colonial era, as the manual labor required to separate seeds from the bolls was time and cost prohibitive.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P2'>This changed in the 1790s when inventor Eli Whitney designed a new cotton gin that could efficiently separate seeds from short staple cotton. The design immediately made the heartier short fiber cotton plant a viable cash crop and spurred the expansion of cotton farming—on large plantations to small farms—across the south. The pursuit of new farmland for cotton production drove westward migration, the displacement of Native Americans in the south, and helped the creation of new states, including Alabama and Mississippi. The cotton gin only mechanized the processing of cotton. Harvesting the cotton bolls was still done by hand (machine harvesting would not become prevalent until the twentieth century). Therefore, the expansion of cotton farms across the south brought with it the rapid growth of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P3'>Planters produced 750,000 bales of cotton in 1830. Twenty years later, in 1850, the south produced 2.85 million bales annually. In 1860, American planters delivered 5.3 million bales. At 400 pounds per bale, the United States produced more than two billion pounds of cotton in 1860. The crop dominated southern agriculture and made the United States one of the world’s top exporters of the product, chiefly to textile mills in England and France. At the eve of the Civil War, southern politicians believed the importance of the south’s cotton exports gave it diplomatic leverage over European powers. Senator James Hammond of South Carolina famously quipped that “no power on earth dares to make war upon [cotton]. Cotton is king.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P4'>Southern secessionist ideas of cotton’s diplomatic influence during the Civil War proved misplaced. The decrease of cotton exports, due to the Union naval blockade and even efforts by Confederate politicians to create international demand by burning 2.5 million bales of southern cotton, failed to coerce England or France to formally side with the Confederacy or make war upon the Union. Strong cotton crops in the 1850s had led to a surplus of cotton in Europe, and Great Britain chose to find alternate sources of cotton (such as India and Egypt) rather than engage embroil itself in the American Civil War. Some desperate southern farmers even traded with federal officials, and occupying Union forces confiscated cotton crops and transferred them north to textile manufacturers in the northeast.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P5'>After the Civil War, cotton production remained an important agricultural interest for the south. The abolition of slavery did not end the role African Americans played as the primary source of labor for cotton harvesting. Freed peoples grew their own cotton crops as tenant farmers or sharecroppers across the south through the late nineteenth century, resulting in the south continually exporting millions of bales each year. Although a lucrative crop, the cotton farmers—white and black—rarely enjoyed wealth from their labor, due to periodic market crashes and competition. Cotton farming did not substantially change until the early twentieth century with the advent of mechanized cotton harvesters. (Wikipedia; census.gov; Eugene R.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58648P0'>A deaf person is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as a person who is "unable to hear, either completely or partly" (Cambridge Dictionary). As with many other disabilities, the treatment and education of the deaf took an increasingly institutional, state-sponsored approach throughout the nineteenth century. Early American deaf education sought primarily to teach deaf persons just enough to accomplish religious purposes like reading the Christian Bible. However, in 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what became the American School for the Deaf in Connecticut. At this school, the deaf were taught not only how to read and write, but how to communicate in French Sign Language (FSL), a precursor to modern American Sign Language (ASL). This approach was adopted by other schools that opened more frequently throughout the United States later in the nineteenth century. Their approaches generally focused on training deaf persons to become good national citizens, rather than just good Christians as had earlier schools. Schools for the deaf remained cut off from others, making attendance at them an isolating experience, yet the nineteenth century generally saw an improvement in the treatment and education of deaf persons. CWRGM adopts the people-first tag "Persons with disabilities--Deaf persons" to emphasize the personhood of those with deafness over their condition (Britannica).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
