                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005041P0'>Military schools are educational programs that incorporate military studies with traditional academic topics. They often emphasize engineering and technical studies. The school lifestyle and environment typically model the military; students are considered cadets, wear uniforms and conduct formation drills, and follow a military-style chain of command. These schools were largely a nineteenth century development in the United States, following the creation of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, during Thomas Jefferson’s presidential administration. While that academy, and the United States Naval Academy, founded in 1845, were federal institutions, most military schools were private or state-funded programs. Military service was not required for the graduates of state or private military programs, but alumni from such schools often sought commissions in the military. Additionally, during the Civil War, the Union and the Confederate armies relied heavily upon graduates of state and federal military academies to train and lead the large numbers of civilian soldiers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25001529P0'>Established by the state of South Carolina in 1842, The Citadel originated as the South Carolina Military Academy to instruct young men in military sciences and higher education. The original academy had two parts: the Citadel Academy in Charleston and the Arsenal Academy in Columbia. The arsenals had been constructed before the school’s founding in part due to fears of slave uprisings, sparked by the Denmark Vesey slave revolt of 1822.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25001529P1'>Cadets from The Citadel took part in early military activities during the secession crisis and the beginning of the Civil War, including manning artillery pieces around Charleston Harbor. Citadel cadets fired cannons at the federal ship <hi rend='italic'>Star of the West</hi> in January 1861 during its effort to resupply U.S. Army personnel at Fort Sumter. These were among the first shots of the Civil War, but the federal government did not initiate a full military response to Confederate attacks upon Union troops until the fall of Fort Sumter in April 1861. The Citadel cadets again took the field when Union armies marched into the Deep South in 1864, seeing action in nine battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25001529P2'>General William T. Sherman’s Union forces captured and burned the Arsenal campus during the Civil War, and the Citadel campus fell to occupying Union troops in 1865. The Citadel remained closed until 1882, when it reopened at its downtown Charleston campus. The school continues to serve as a state military collage, though since 1922 at a location on the northwestern edge of Charleston. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63985P0'>Opened in 1802 at West Point, New York, the United States Military Academy is the oldest federal service academy in the United States. Proposed in legislation from Alexander Hamilton, and begun at the direction of President Thomas Jefferson, the academy (often referred to as “West Point”) started with few standards regarding age of cadets or length of study. The War of 1812 prompted revisions within the program and in 1817 the academy’s superintendent Colonel Sylvanus Thayer established a curriculum modeled after the École Polytechnique school in Paris, France, that emphasized technical and engineering instruction. The program was so successful, that it became the model engineering program within the United States during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P1'>By the 1830s, most commissioned officers in the U.S. Army were West Point graduates. However, distrust among many Americans of a strong national government and aristocracy (as well as jealousy among other aspiring military officers), led to some calls for the elimination of the academy. These calls went unheeded, and the strong performance by West Point graduates during the Mexican War in the late 1840s highlighted the value of the academy to the U.S. military.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P2'>The Civil War divided West Point alumni. Some of the most notable academy graduates and staff served the Confederacy, most notably Robert E. Lee. Most of the leading Union generals were also West Point alum, including Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, and George B. McClellan. Over the course of the war, 294 West Point graduates achieved the rank of general in the Union Army and 151 rose to the rank of general in the Confederate Army. The war also cost the lives of 105 West Point graduates, while 151 were wounded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P3'>Due to political tensions within the U.S. from the Civil War, southern applicants were not admitted to West Point until 1868—three years after the end of the war. The first Black cadet, James Webster Smith, was admitted in 1870, however he faced severe discrimination by other cadets and some staff, leading to altercations, a suspension, and eventually dismissal under controversial circumstances. The first African American cadet to graduate West Point was Henry O. Flipper in 1877.

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P4'>West Point continues to operate as military service academy training college-aged cadets for the officer corps of the U.S. Army. (Wikipedia)
