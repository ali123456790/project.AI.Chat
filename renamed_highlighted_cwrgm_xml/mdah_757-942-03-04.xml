                    <p xml:id='OTPS73484P0'>Jacob Thompson was a U.S. politician and then a Confederate official, including the leader of secret plots against the north, during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P1'>Born on May 15, 1810, in Leasburg, North Carolina, Thompson graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1831 and afterwards briefly taught there before studying law. He moved to Mississippi and became a practicing attorney in 1834. Thompson showed interest in public and political office as early as 1837, when he unsuccessfully sought the office of Mississippi attorney general. Only two years later he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served until 1851.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P2'>Thompson returned to Mississippi after the end of his last Congressional term and practiced law. He turned down an appointment to U.S. Consul to Havana, Cuba, in 1853 and then lost an 1855 U.S. Senate election to Jefferson Davis. In 1857, he accepted an appointment as U.S. Secretary of the Interior under President James Buchanan. He served in that capacity during the contentious debate over the future of slavery in the territories during the late 1850s. Thompson initially took a moderate position, arguing against northern anti-slavery agitators and southern extremists who threatened secessionists. However, he sided with the lower south following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory, and became a secession commissioner from Mississippi and went to North Carolina to encourage that state's separation from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P3'>Thompson resigned his position as Interior Secretary in January 1861 and accepted the role of Inspector General of the Confederate army. He later received an army commission and served on the staff of Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard.  Thompson participated in several campaigns in the western theater, including Vicksburg in 1863. In March 1864, he received an assignment by Confederate president Jefferson Davis to lead secret service operations in Canada. Over the next several months, he reportedly developed missions to free Confederate prisoners from Union prison camps, generate anti-war agitation among northern Democrats, foment an insurgency in parts of the northern states, and starting fires in New York City. These plans failed, but reports of his activities generated excitement and fear in northern communities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P4'>When the war ended in 1865, Thompson fled to England and then Canada. He later returned to the United States, when tensions had cooled and most Confederate veterans had received pardons. His Mississippi property had largely been destroyed during the Civil War, so Thompson created a new home for himself in Memphis, Tennessee. He became a board member of the University of the South. Thompson died on March 24, 1885. He was married to Catharine Jones and had at least one child. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63562P0'>John Cabell Breckinridge was an attorney, politician, and vice president of the United States, who became a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P1'>Born on January 16, 1821, in Lexington, Kentucky, Breckinridge was part of a family of notable politicians, including his father who served as Kentucky’s secretary of state, a grandfather who had been a U.S. senator, and a great grandfather who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Breckinridge was well educated in his youth and eventually graduated with a law degree from Transylvania University. He began a successful law practice in Kentucky and became active in local public and political affairs. When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Breckinridge sought a military commission. He eventually was made a major in the Third Kentucky Infantry Regiment and traveled with the unit to Mexico. However, by the time the regiment arrived at the front, most of the fighting was finished, and Breckinridge saw no combat. Nevertheless, his military service proved a benefit for his burgeoning political career.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P2'>Breckinridge won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1849. He proved to be a strong defender of slaveholding interests in a state that bordered many free northern states. In 1851, he entered the U.S. House of Representatives from Kentucky, and became a close associate with notable statesman Henry Clay of Kentucky. He won election for a second term and played a prominent role in the passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act in 1854, which overturned the Missouri Compromise's prohibition of slavery in certain federal territories. He declined to run for a third term, due to political redistricting that made his reelection unlikely. However, in 1856, he was nominated as James Buchanan’s vice presidential candidate on the Democratic presidential ticket. Buchanan and Breckinridge won the 1856 election, and Breckinridge served as the U.S. vice president from 1857 to 1859, when he was elected to fill a vacant Kentucky seat in the U.S. Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P3'>During the 1860 presidential election, southern Democrats split from the national Democratic Party, largely due to disagreements over the defense of slavery. The national party nominated northerner Stephen A. Douglas while the southern Democrats held a separate convention and nominated Breckinridge. This split helped doom overall Democratic Party success at the 1860 polls, resulting in the election of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate, to the presidency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P4'>During the secession crisis that followed Lincoln’s election, Breckinridge served in the U.S. Senate. His southern sympathies were well known, but Kentucky did not formally secede. In October 1861, when it was clear that his state would remain in the Union, Breckinridge resigned his seat and joined the Confederacy. He was widely criticized by many in Kentucky as a traitor to the United States. Soon afterwards, he accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate army, and was subsequently promoted to major general. Breckinridge led Confederate troops at several battles in the eastern and western theaters, including Shiloh, Vicksburg, Baton Rouge, Murfreesboro, and Monocacy. In February 1865, near the end of the war, he was appointed Secretary of War of the Confederacy. By then the Confederate government was nearly in shambles and the war ended before he played much of an administrative role.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P5'>Breckinridge initially fled to the Caribbean, then Great Britain, and then Canada rather than surrender to Union forces. He met his family in Canada and then moved to France and Switzerland, rather than risk arrest by returning to the United States. He finally moved back to Kentucky after President Andrew Johnson issued a full amnesty for former Confederates in December 1868.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63562P6'>Breckinridge refrained from reentering politics, despite requests from his supporters. He engaged in railroad business and participated in public events only as a private citizen. He died from complications of a lung surgery on May 17, 1875. He was married to Mary Burch and had at least seven children. He is buried in the Lexington Cemetery in Lexington, Kentucky.

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P1'>Born on a sugar plantation in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, on May 28, 1818, Beauregard was from a wealthy, slave owning Louisiana Creole family and grew up speaking French. He did not begin to learn English until attending a school in New York City at the age of twelve. Beauregard attended West Point and was an exceptional student, showing great aptitude in artillery and engineering. He graduated second in his class in 1838.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P2'>Beauregard served with distinction as a military engineer during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. He was brevetted (honorarily promoted) to captain for his performance at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco, and brevetted again to major for his actions at Chapultepec, where he was wounded in the shoulder and thigh. Following the Mexican-American War, Beauregard oversaw military engineering projects along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast. However, by 1856 he grew tired of peacetime service and nearly traveled to Nicaragua to take part in a revolution there being carried out by American volunteers. He was talked out of the effort by his Army colleagues, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott (who had personally seen Beauregard’s performances in Mexico). In January 1861, he secured an appointment as superintendent of West Point. However, he held the position for only five days before Louisiana’s secession prompted U.S. Army officials to revoke the orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P3'>Beauregard returned to New Orleans in early 1861 and joined the Confederate cause. Because of his previous service and reputation, he was quickly promoted, becoming the first Confederate general on March 1, 1861. His first assignment was command over defenses in Charleston, South Carolina. Federal soldiers there under Major Robert A. Anderson—one of Beauregard’s West Point instructors—occupied Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor and refused to relinquish the post without a fight. On April 12, 1861, Beauregard ordered Confederate cannons in Charleston to fire on Fort Sumter, and after a thirty-four hour bombardment Anderson surrendered. The attack upon U.S. Army troops sparked the Civil War, as it spurred President Abraham Lincoln to call for 75,000 volunteers to defeat southern secessionists and led to several other southern states to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P4'>After his victory at Fort Sumter, Beauregard received command of Confederate forces defending northern Virginia and successfully defeated a Union army under Brigadier General Irvin McDowell at the First Battle of Bull Run, near Manassas, Virginia, in July 1861. Despite these victories, Beauregard ran into controversy. He had a brash personality, and publicly criticized people like Confederate president Jefferson Davis; additionally, he bickered with some Confederate officials over strategy, his critics complaining his plans were overly complicated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P5'>In early 1862, Beauregard was transferred to the western theater where he became second-in-command of the Army of Mississippi under General Albert Sidney Johnston. The Confederates attacked Ulysses S. Grant’s army at Pittsburgh Landing along the Tennessee River in early April 1862. More famously known as the Battle of Shiloh, Beauregard took command of the Confederate forces after Johnston was mortally wounded. Despite initial success, Beauregard halted his men due to darkness only to withdraw the following day when Grant’s men were reinforced and counterattacked. Receiving criticism for retreating at Shiloh, Beauregard infuriated Confederate officials more when he abandoned the key railroad hub at Corinth, Mississippi, shortly afterwards. Although his withdrawal had been made to avoid being surrounded by a larger Union force, and because his army was suffering greatly from disease and contaminated water at Corinth, the dual retreats hurt Beauregard’s reputation. When he temporarily left his post for medical treatment, Jefferson Davis relieved him of command.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P6'>Beauregard’s next assignment was a return to Charleston to once against take over defenses of the southeastern Confederate coastline. He performed well, frustrating several Union assaults against Charleston Harbor. However, Beauregard believed his position was beneath his abilities. He interjected himself into political matters, proposing negotiations with federal officials and working behind the scenes to increase the number of Confederate troops in the west at the expense of General Robert E. Lee’s army in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P7'>In early 1864, Beauregard received orders to command Confederate defenses of North Carolina and southern Virginia. He performed very well in this role when Union armies under Ulysses S. Grant and Benjamin Butler maneuvered toward Richmond. Beauregard blocked Butler’s force and protected the key railroad center at Petersburg that summer. Meanwhile, William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army captured Atlanta, Georgia, prompting Confederate high command to shift command in the west. Beauregard was asked to command the new Department of the West, which covered a region from Georgia to the Mississippi River. While the position was not a field command, Beauregard took the opportunity as it placed him above several Confederate armies. The assignment proved difficult, as his troops in Tennessee suffered devastating defeats at Franklin and Nashville and scattered southern forces in Georgia and South Carolina failed to stop Sherman’s army from cutting through Georgia and South Carolina. When Beauregard repeatedly messaged Confederate officials in Richmond for help against Sherman, they relieved him of command and replaced him with Joseph E. Johnston. Unsurprisingly, Johnston fared no better and Confederate forces in the Carolinas were forced to surrender in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P8'>After the Civil War, Beauregard returned to New Orleans. He opposed Radical Reconstruction measures in the south, but less due to matters over Black civil rights and more regarding heavy property tax. Beauregard joined the Reform Party, generally made up of New Orleans businessmen who supported Black suffrage, and appealed to African American voters as an alternative to the Republican Party. He also took part in various business ventures, including railroads and cable car companies, civil engineering projects, and he served as the supervisor of the Louisiana State Lottery Company. He enjoyed substantial financial success from these activities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P9'>Beauregard was married twice during his lifetime. He married Marie Antoinette Laure Villere in 1841. The couple had three children, but Marie died during childbirth to the third in 1850. Beauregard then married Caroline Deslonde in 1860. She died only four years later after a long illness. Beauregard died on February 20, 1893. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25018595P0'>Rooted in the Lieber Code and other military customs, Union and Confederate militaries were expected to acknowledge surrendering enemies and treat them as prisoners of war who could then be imprisoned, paroled, and/or exchanged. Historically, European practices held that prisoners of war could be released if they swore an oath not to bear arms against those who captured them until they were exchanged for an enemy soldier.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018595P1'>Mimicking European practices, in 1862 Union and Confederate militaries developed, what historian Caroline E. Janney describes as "an elaborate prison cartel system." (Caroline E. Janney, <hi rend='italic'>Ends of War: The Unfinished Fight of Lee's Army after Appomattox</hi>, p. 25) In July of that year, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Union Maj. Gen. John A Dix to negotiated formal prisoner exchange arrangements with Confederate representative, Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill. (David Silkenat, "How Civil War Soldiers Viewed Surrender," H-Net) Under this system, captured uniformed soldiers were typically paroled and exchanged because neither the Union or the Confederacy wanted to expend the manpower and funds on maintaining large numbers of captured enemy soldiers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018595P2'>Under the Dix-Hill cartel, "Union paroled prisoners were held in their own army’s parole camps until exchanged, while Confederates went home to await exchange." (Silkenat, "How Civil War Soldiers Viewed Surrender") Consequently, paroles depended almost entirely on soldiers upholding their oaths not to resume fighting until they had been exchanged for an equivalent number of prisoners from the other side. Those who violated the terms of their parole faced recapture or execution. (Janney, <hi rend='italic'>Ends of War</hi>, p. 25; Silkenat, "How Civil War Soldiers Viewed Surrender")

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018595P3'>After the summer of 1863, the Union and Confederacy accused one another of violating the terms of their parol. Furthermore, the Confederacy announced they would not treat captured African American soldiers as prisoners of war but instead as fugitive slaves. Consequently, the prisoner exchange system broke down. The number of paroles decreased dramatically, and the Dix-Hill cartel was replaced by prisoner of war camps like Andersonville, where captured white enemy combatants were housed under poor conditions for the duration of the war. For those African American soldiers who surrendered to the Confederate forces, they faced enslavement, re-enslavement, and death, such as the massacre of Black troops at Ft. Pillow.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

To care for Union soldiers suffering from illness or wounds sustained during fighting in Tennessee, federal officers established several hospitals throughout the city. The hospitals were set up in existing buildings, such as warehouses, churches, schools, office buildings, and any other vacant or suitable structure requisitioned by military staff. By the summer of 1863, Nashville had twenty-five military hospitals. Four were located along Market Street. One was in the University Building along South Market Street on College Hill, the second was in a carriage factory on North Market Street near the Public Square, the third was in Morris and Stratton’s Building at Number 14 North Market Street near the corner of Clark Street, and the fourth was at the H.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.
