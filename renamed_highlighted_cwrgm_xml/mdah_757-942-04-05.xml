                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25008803P0'>During the Civil War, the Confederate government sought ways to finance its military expenditures. Due to strong states’ rights sentiments within the South, the Confederacy’s central government was much weaker than the United States federal government in Washington, D.C. Therefore, Confederate authorities had comparatively less authority and support to levy direct taxes on the civilian population. While direct taxes (such as property taxes and a newly enacted income tax) on northern citizens made up approximately 20% of the U.S. government’s revenue during the Civil War, only around 8% of Confederate revenue throughout the war came from these same sources.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25008803P1'>Confederate authorities sought more options to boost the central government’s coffers and fund the war effort. In August 1861, the Confederate Congress passed the “War Tax,” which taxed Southern citizens for certain luxury items and property valued $500 or greater, including taxes on enslaved people. The funds realized from that tax did not prove sufficient for the expanding costs of war, leading the Confederate government in 1863 to implement a graduated income tax that placed a one percent tax on the first $1,500 earned, and then a two percent tax on additional wages. A more substantial program emerged in April 1863, based on a tithing system of civilians providing ten percent of their agricultural products. Known as the Impressment Act, many of the provisions and supplies gathered from this policy went directly to the Confederate military. These measures led to some fraud and corruption, as well as protest from southern civilians and officials of government overreach, but overall did provide important financial and supply support to the Confederate war effort.

Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32002859P0'>The Capture of New Orleans (also known as the Battle of New Orleans, 1862) was fought on April 25 – May 1, 1862 in St. Bernard’s and Orleans parishes, Louisiana between Union naval forces commanded by Flag Officer David G. Farragut and land forces commanded by Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler and Confederate forces commanded by Maj. Gen. Mansfield Lovell. It resulted in a Union victory. Union authorities identified New Orleans as an important target as it was the Confederacy’s largest city and an international trade port. Capturing the city would hinder the South’s economy. The approach to New Orleans via the Mississippi River was guarded on either side by Fort Jackson and Fort St. Phillip with a heavy defensive anti-ship chain strung between them. Additionally, five Confederate warships, including two ironclads, and support ships guarded the waterway to the city. On April 18 Farragut began his attack on the forts.  When bombardment by the Union fleet failed to neutralize the Confederate forts, Farragut ordered his ships to sail past them on April 24, defeating the Confederate fleet and pushing toward New Orleans. Farragut anchored his fleet at New Orleans on April 25, meeting minimal resistance. Local authorities surrendered the city later the same day. On April 28 Fort St. Phillip and Fort Jackson surrendered. New Orleans would remain in Union hands until the end of the war. The capture of New Orleans denied the Confederacy a major trading port and therefore an important source of revenue. (American Battlefield Trust; Encyclopedia Britannica)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63977P0'>The United States Navy, also known as the Union Navy during the American Civil War, was primarily responsible for blockading the Confederacy’s coastlines and harbors, destroying Confederate ships, and supporting Union Army amphibious operations along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shores, and river. At the beginning of the war, the Union Navy had ninety ships, far outmatching the Confederacy’s fourteen vessels. Through the North’s superior manufacturing capabilities and larger population, the Union Navy substantially increased its force to more than 650 ships and 20,000 sailors by the time the war ended. In comparison, the Confederate Navy barely surpassed one hundred ships and 5,000 sailors.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P1'>The Union Navy’s blockade of the Confederacy was very successful, cutting the South’s trade to only five percent of its pre-war numbers. In a vain effort to defeat the federal ships blocking their harbors, Confederate forces focused on innovative ship technology, such as ironclad vessels (wooden ships protected by iron plates) and the first operational submarine (named the Henley). Union officials managed to counter these efforts by developing their own ironclad ships, including the USS <I>Monitor</I>, a flat, iron-plated vessel with a rotating turret.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P2'>While the Union Navy did engage in a few notable sea battles (the fight between the USS <I>Monitor</I> and the Confederacy’s ironclad CSS <I>Virginia</I> being the most famous), most of its combat action involved supporting the Union Army’s ground operations along the Mississippi River, at Mobile Bay, and in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fort Fisher, North Carolina. Capturing ports and coastal fortifications not only reduced the strength of the Confederate military, but gave the Union Navy vital supply bases for its own operations around the South. The assaults upon the coastal positions involved more traditional naval warfare with cannonading by wooden ships; but the Navy developed the shallower draft ironclads for operations on the rivers and waterways. These steam-powered ships were more maneuverable than wooden sail ships, and were better protected against close-range artillery by Confederate river forts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P3'>After the Civil War, the Union Navy—like the army—downsized to a number close to its pre-war number. However, the war had introduced key technological and doctrinal changes to sea and river warfare across the globe. At least for a short time, the Union Navy had been the most technologically advanced maritime force in the world. (Wikipedia; American Battlefield Trust)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226732P2' xml:id='OTP25226732P2'>D<add place='above'>r</add> Sir [gap] In these trying times you will not consider it intruding, if one offers some suggestions that can permanently secure for all time, the safe and quiet use to the confederacy, of as much of the <rs ref='#S63143'>Mississippi River</rs> as is indespensable to have crossing for travellers, and Rail-roads wherever needed, and which shall be inaccessible to the <rs ref='#S71916'>enemy</rs>.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226732P3' xml:id='OTP25226732P3'>It is not a difficult matter to obstruct the River entirely across, and make it impassable at a point below the mouth of <rs ref='#S25018773'>Red river</rs>, and also at a point above <rs ref='#S63147'>Memphis</rs>, embracing the railroads between, provided a strong protecting force, and strong batteries be stationed at the points designated, to keep off the enemy while the work of placing the obstructions is going on, and to protect the works afterwards. The batteries to be covered over with railroad iron and walled in, so that shells may burst on and about them, and yet do but little harm. With these protecting this very important measure could be shortly and successfully accomplished, and thus permanently secure without fear of interruptions from the <rs ref='#S63977'>gun boats of the enemy</rs>, a vast inland commerce between the States of the confederacy on both sides of the River.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226732P4' xml:id='OTP25226732P4'>The barrier below would prevent any more boats ascending, sent round from the North, and the barrier above would prevent any from descending from the <rs ref='#S87722'>Ohio</rs> or elsewhere. In the mean time if the gun boats and mortar boats of the enemy now present do not escape, measures must certainly taken to capture or destroy them, and they must be prevented from bulding any between the proposed barriers.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226732P5' xml:id='OTP25226732P5'>The obstructions above and below being completed would give us an inland Sea, swarming with our Steam Boats many hundred miles in length, and into ^which^ the <rs ref='#S32004891'>Arkansas</rs> and <rs ref='#S25018773'>Red rivers</rs> empty. The boats from those rivers could ascend and descend at pleasure, and the entire benefits accrue to the confederacy, which would then be per-fectly self sustaining; developing her giant strength as she grows instead of being strangled in her infancy; and the world out-side would see, that we can thrive without <rs ref='#S63017'>New Orleans</rs>, which would be rendered valueless to the enemy, but when restored, it would be more valuable than ever to the Confederacy.

          <p corresp='TTP25226733P0' xml:id='OTP25226733P0'>It ought not to be expected that a short war will accomplish our deliverance. Patch up a hasty peace and the prosperity of the Confederacy will be retarded a century if not crippled for ever; but if the means we [profess?] are judiciously and faithfully used, success is sure to follow. The <rs ref='#S32002859'>occupation of New Orleans</rs> by the enemy teaches us what we must yet do, to [wit?]. Deprive him of the use of the Mississippi River, and his naval arm of attack is [halved?] and useless.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P1' xml:id='OTP25226733P1'>The finger of Providence points out the loss of New Orleans to be our gain instead of our disaster, if we but do our duty, and help ourselves with the resources of men and means that we profess, and ask me favours of the world outside. In the mean time, the Confederacy will establish her <rs ref='#S99180'>manufactories</rs> to supply all reasonable wants, and grow stronger and stronger instead of being exhausted du-ring the contest. Indeed the Mississippi <hi rend='underline'>must</hi> be secured at any cost however great; and <hi rend='underline'>now</hi> while the water is low is the time to <hi rend='underline'>begin</hi> to try, and that without delay.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P2' xml:id='OTP25226733P2'>The way the obstructing above proposed, can be easily made, is by driving piles obliquely, so as to place rows of snags entirely across the river.—When driven sufficiently to plant them firm, <hi rend='underline'>they should be pointed sharp</hi>.—The snags should point <hi rend='underline'>up stream</hi> above memphis, and down <hi rend='underline'>stream</hi> below the mouth of Red river. Pile-drivers can be arranged to work on various craft built for the purpose. vz
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P3' xml:id='OTP25226733P3'>A square hull, the deck of which is a floating platform, on which a small steam engine can be placed to haul up the logs into the jaws of the pile driver. Such a one was used to drive the piles at <rs ref='#S32004894'>pass manshac</rs>. It was a small affair, but answered the purpose very well.—A crank will do to work by hand, if not convenient to get an Engine.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P4' xml:id='OTP25226733P4'>Or a boat built with two sections after the manner of a ferry boat that has but one water wheel and that in the middle. Over the space between the sections, the pile-driver can be placed, and the logs drawn up by crank or engine.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P5' xml:id='OTP25226733P5'>Several rows of these Snags should be planted; the more the better.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P6' xml:id='OTP25226733P6'>Have no <rs ref='#S72745'>contractors</rs>. The work is simple—A few hundred <rs ref='#S63099'>hands</rs> can soon cut, prepare and launch the logs, and tow them to the pile drivers as fast as wanted.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P7' xml:id='OTP25226733P7'>Chains or cables across the river as a barrier is worse than useless.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P8' xml:id='OTP25226733P8'>After the satsifaction of peace, the piles can either be removed, or the work improved, and two openings made in each barrier, one for vessels to pass up, and the other for them to pass down, <hi rend='underline'>from</hi> and <hi rend='underline'>to</hi> New Orleans as usual; and <rs ref='#S25008803'>tolls or duties</rs> estab-lished to pay for lights, <rs ref='#S79307'>watchmen</rs> &amp;c to prevent <rs ref='#S25025275'>smuggling</rs>, and also to keep the works in repair.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P9' xml:id='OTP25226733P9'>Very Respectfully submitted
</p>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P11' xml:id='OTP25226733P11'>P. S. The rows of piles are part of my plan, but perhaps they will suffice without any thing more.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P12' xml:id='OTP25226733P12'>Behind the piles I would place several rows of wooden piers of triangular form, built with logs 20 feet long for two sides, and 6 feet long for the base; placed near enough to let the river run between them without hindrance, but impassable for boats.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P13' xml:id='OTP25226733P13'>The whole would stand in position, thus,
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P14' xml:id='OTP25226733P14'>[Image: Horizontal drawing depicting the described obstruction of the Mississippi River. The left side of the drawing indicates "Below Red River," while the right side of the drawing indicates "Above Memphis."]
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P15' xml:id='OTP25226733P15'>The floods and drift wood, will pass over the piles at the high stages of water, without injury. Although the work would be rough, it would be correct &amp; substantial and endure for ages. After the war these barriers will not be in the way because openings can be made for boats to pass and repass as above stated. Should another war occur these works would stand ready, and during peace, be a permanent wall against enemies within and without.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P16' xml:id='OTP25226733P16'>For occular demonstration, I have made a rough model of these piers, and written down the details to understand and carry out the work. I will send it to you if acceptable.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25226733P17' xml:id='OTP25226733P17'>Also will come and explain personally if agreeable.
