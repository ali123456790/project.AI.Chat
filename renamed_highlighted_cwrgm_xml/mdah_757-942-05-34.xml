                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74655P0'>Sterling Price was a U.S. politician before the Civil War and then a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P1'>Born in September 1809 in Prince Edward County, Virginia, Price received a moderate education and studied law in Virginia before moving to Missouri around 1830. He entered local politics and in 1836 won election to Missouri’s House of Representatives. He joined the state militia and stepped away from the legislature to participate in anti-Mormon military activities in the state in the late 1830s. After the Mormon conflict, Price focused on farming a large amount of land he had received from his father in Missouri. He owned several dozen slaves during this period, and became a strong advocate for the institution of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P2'>In 1842, Price again entered the Missouri legislature. Then, in 1844, he successfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives. When the Mexican-American War started in 1846, he volunteered for military service and took command of the Second Missouri Mounted Infantry Regiment. In early 1847, Price was sent to New Mexico, where he defeated an insurrection by Pueblo and Hispano people, and was then appointed military governor over the territory. He then saw some combat against a small Mexican force at the very end of the Mexican-American War. Price returned to Missouri as a war hero, which he used for political gain, becoming governor in 1853. Among the more notable developments that occurred during his four years in office include the creation of Washington University in St. Louis and the expansion of railroad development. Price spent the latter part of the 1850s as Missouri’s Bank Commissioner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P3'>Price publicly opposed secession in the wake of Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860. He presided over Missouri’s convention in February 1861, which voted to remain in the Union. However, he privately worked with pro-secessionist governor Claiborne Fox Jackson to strengthen the Missouri militia in support of the Confederacy. When federal forces under Nathaniel Lyon clashed with the militiamen near St. Louis in May 1861, Price formally backed the Confederacy. Taking command of the Missouri State Guard and pro-secession forces, he defeated a Union army under Lyon at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek in August 1861. He then saw battlefield success at Lexington, Missouri, in September 1861. Commissioned as a major general in the Confederate Army in March 1862, he was defeated in battle at Pea Ridge, Arkansas, and then lost at Iuka and Corinth in Mississippi. Price continued to lead Confederate troops in minor engagements in 1863, and then carried out an ambitious offensive campaign into Missouri and Kansas in late 1864. He scored several minor victories during the campaign, but was defeated at Westport, near modern-day Kansas City, Missouri. Price’s army retreated southward along the Kansas-Missouri border, losing additional engagements and withdrawing into Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P4'>Price chose to go into Mexico rather than surrender to Union forces in 1865. He and several ex-Confederates tried to create a colony in Carlota, Veracruz. In 1866, after Mexican officials proved unsupportive of the colony, Price returned to Missouri. He suffered from numerous health problems, many related to conditions he had contracted during his various military experiences over the previous years, including cholera. He died on September 29, 1867. Price was married to Martha Head and had six children who survived to adulthood. He is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

<p corresp='TTP25012649P5' xml:id='OTP25012649P5'><rs ref='#S25001560'>A. Warren</rs>, <rs ref='#S25001561'>A. J. Hyde</rs> (owners) and <rs ref='#S55552'>John Gordan</rs>, <rs ref='#S25003118'>C. J Sherman</rs> (workmen). I state to you as the reason for this request that I have just entered into a contract with Miss Warren &amp; Hyde for the manufacture of 1500 ^pr^ shoes for Gen. <rs ref='#S74655'>Price's</rs> <rs ref='#S70882'>army</rs>. The parties own a tan yard &amp; the services of both are required at the tan yard &amp; shop in order to get the work done in any reasonable time. A large number of men in Gen Price's army are without shoes, and should the army be required to move a great ^many^ would have to be left behind. They are men who are the bravest of the brave and some have fought thro' half dozen pitched battles &amp; twenty skirmishes. These men would be rendering a far greater service to our cause by remaining to make shoes for the young &amp; have men of out veteran army, than by going into the field themselves.

<p corresp='TTP25012649P6' xml:id='OTP25012649P6'>I will further state to you that I shall have to make other contracts for the manufacture of shoes
