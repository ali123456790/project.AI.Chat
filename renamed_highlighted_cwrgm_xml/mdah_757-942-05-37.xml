                    <p xml:id='OTPS86445P0'>Braxton Bragg was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P1'>Born on March 22, 1817, in Warrenton, North Carolina, Bragg attended the prestigious Warrenton Male Academy as a young teenager and then entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, at the age of 16. He performed well at the academy, reportedly due to an exceptional memory and good discipline, and graduated in 1837. His first military assignment was in Florida during the Second Seminole War, but he served as a commissary officer and adjutant, seeing no combat. He later commanded a company of the Third United States Artillery and was stationed at St. Augustine, Florida, and then Fort Moultrie outside of Charleston, South Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P2'>During his first few years of service, Bragg quarreled with other officers and proved outspoken. He wrote a series of essays in the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Literary Messenger</hi> criticizing army leadership. For this he was court martialed upon charges of disobedience and received an official reprimand and temporary suspension of rank. Despite this punishment, Bragg continued to be argumentative. This trait, along with his propensity for strict discipline and obedience to regulations, made him unpopular and the target of stories and rumors among fellow officers. In his memoirs, Ulysses S. Grant, who knew Bragg at West Point and in the Army in the 1840s, recalled hearing of an incident in which Bragg served as a company commander at an Army post, and was made acting quartermaster while his another officer was on detached duty. As company commander, Bragg submitted a formal request for supplies from the quartermaster’s office. As acting quartermaster, he rejected his own request, with a written note on the order explaining his reasons. Bragg, in his role as company commander, protested that his supply request was appropriate, to which he, as acting quartermaster, again rejected the request a second time. Bragg then elevated the matter to the post commander, who reportedly exclaimed, “My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled [<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>] with every officer in the army, and now you are quarrelling with yourself!” While possibly apocryphal, the story reflected Bragg’s reputation among his army colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P3'>Bragg’s performance during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, boosted his army career and reputation. He earned repeated promotions for bravery. His obsession with discipline served the American army well, as his troops were among the best trained on the battlefield. He was brevetted (honorarily promoted) to captain after the Battle of Fort Brown in May 1846, brevetted to major after the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846, and then again to lieutenant colonel after Buena Vista in February 1847. His actions at Buena Vista were especially celebrated, as Bragg positioned his artillery at a key gap in the American line and repulsed a larger Mexican force. Among those who admired Bragg’s actions during the battle was Jefferson Davis, who commanded a Mississippi regiment, but later became secretary of war for the United States and then president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P4'>In 1849, Bragg married Eliza Brooks Ellis, the daughter of a wealthy sugar planter from Louisiana. She followed Bragg to his next military assignments, but by 1855 the couple chose to pursue a life outside of the army. Bragg resigned from the army in 1856 and he and his wife purchased a massive sugar plantation in Louisiana. He managed the sugar cultivation and production with the same adherence to discipline, overseeing more than one hundred slaves on the property. He became active in Louisiana affairs, receiving an appointment as colonel in the Louisiana militia. Bragg initially opposed talk of secession in the south, but followed Louisiana into the Confederacy. He received a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate army in March 1861 and was promoted to major general in September 1861. His first assignment involved commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida. Later, he was transferred to the Army of Mississippi where he commanded a corps under Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P5'>Bragg’s first major engagement during the Civil War was Shiloh, Tennessee, in April 1862. Although Confederate forces were forced to retreat, Bragg performed well at the battle and received a promotion to full general in the Confederacy Army only a week afterwards. He was given command of the Army of Mississippi, renamed the Army of Tennessee. His performance as an army commander afterwards in 1862 and 1863 had mixed results. At battles like Murfreesboro and Chickamauga, Bragg scored early tactical victories but failed to defeat his Union opponents. His brash personality and quarrelsome behavior aggravated subordinates, who called for his removal. However Jefferson Davis remained committed to Bragg and kept him in command of Confederate troops in Tennessee until November 1863, when Bragg offered his resignation following the Confederate defeat at Chattanooga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P6'>Even without a field command, Bragg remained a powerful military figure in the Confederacy. He served as an advisor to Davis and proved an able administrator for the Confederate prison system and medical system. In late 1864, he temporarily commanded Confederate troops in the Carolinas and Georgia coastline. Initially successful, a Union victory at Wilmington, North Carolina, in early 1865 undermined his standing, and he spent the final months commanding a corps commander under Joseph E. Johnston. He surrendered to Union forces in early May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P7'>Bragg’s sugar plantation had been confiscated by federal troops during the Civil War, leaving Bragg and his wife homeless at the end of the war. The couple briefly lived in Alabama, but moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1867 where Bragg became superintendent of the New Orleans waterworks. When he lost his job to a Republican appointee, Bragg received an offer from former Confederate president Jefferson Davis to work for the Carolina Life Insurance Company. He left the job after a few months and undertook a series of other positions with public works and railroad companies in Alabama and Texas, many lasting only a few months before he resigned following disagreements with other executives.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P8'>Bragg died suddenly on September 27, 1876, in Galveston, Texas, possibly from a stroke or aneurism. He was 59 years old. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25011848P0'>William Tecumseh Sherman was a Union general most famous for capturing Atlanta, Georgia, and conducting a military campaign across Georgia, helping bringing an end to the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P1'>Born on February 8, 1820, in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman was the son of a large and prestigious family. However, his father died suddenly in 1829, leading to Sherman and his siblings being sent to live with friends and family. Sherman moved in with Thomas Ewing, who later became a United States senator. Ewing helped Sherman receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1840 and saw service in Florida during the Seminole Wars.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P2'>Sherman was sent to California during the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s and missed the field experience and promotions many of his military colleagues enjoyed during campaigns in Mexico. He married Ellen Boyle Ewing, one Ewing’s daughters, in 1850. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage. He remained in military service in California until 1853, when he resigned and went into banking. He proved moderately successful, but left California in the late 1850s and moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, to work as an office manager in a law firm operated by two of his wife’s brothers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P3'>In 1859, Sherman received an offer to be superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning &amp; Military Academy in Pineville, Louisiana. (The school would later become Louisiana State University.) He proved to be an effective teacher and school administrator, and was popular among students and faculty. However, when the Civil War broke out in 1861, Sherman resigned from the position and traveled north to volunteer for Union military service. He was commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S. Infantry Regiment, and then placed in command of a brigade of volunteers in Virginia. He led the brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The battle was an embarrassing defeat for the Union Army, but Sherman performed well and was promoted to brigadier general. He was sent to Kentucky to assist federal military operations in the west.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P4'>While in Kentucky, Sherman expressed his belief that the conflict would be long and bloody. He received criticism for this unpopular opinion, although he was later proven entirely correct. In late 1861, Sherman began to suffer from depression, contemplating suicide, and resigned from his position in Kentucky. After recuperating for several weeks, he returned to service in December 1861 and was placed in charge of logistical operations in the Department of the Mississippi. In that role he supported Ulysses S. Grant’s successful capture of Fort Donelson, and was so impressed by the victory that he requested to serve under Grant, despite technically having higher seniority in rank. In March 1862, the War Department granted Sherman’s wish and was given command of a division within Grant’s Army of West Tennessee, helping establish one of the most effective partnerships in U.S. military history.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P5'>Only a month later, in April 1862, Sherman’s division was overrun by Confederate troops under Albert Sidney Johnston during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh. Sherman rallied many of his soldiers and, alongside Grant, the next day counterattacked and pushed the southern troops back to win the battle. Sherman was wounded twice at Shiloh, and had three horses shot from under him. Grant was impressed with Sherman’s performance, and the War Department promoted him to major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P6'>Over the next two years, Sherman became one of Grant’s most trusted subordinates, leading part of Grant’s army during the Vicksburg campaign and during engagements around Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1863. In the spring of 1864, when Grant received promotion as overall commander of Union armies, Sherman was placed in command of federal troops in the western theater. Grant relocated to Virginia to lead Union forces against Robert E. Lee’s famed Army of Northern Virginia while Sherman crafted a plan to drive an army into the heart of the Confederacy. In early 1864, he launched a campaign from Chattanooga to capture the major industrial city of Atlanta. Over the course of several weeks, he commanded three Union armies in a coordinated advance against Confederate forces under Joseph E. Johnston. Sherman captured Atlanta in September 1864, strongly boosting northern morale and aiding to Abraham Lincoln’s reelection in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P7'>Following his capture of Atlanta, Sherman embarked on an even bolder campaign. Leaving two of his three armies to watch a Confederate army under John Bell Hood in Tennessee, Sherman personally took command of his third army and ordered it to march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah. The effort involved a great deal of risk, as it saw Sherman’s army cut off from other Union forces, with no base of supply or reinforcements. With 60,000 soldiers, Sherman advanced across Georgia, destroying buildings, burning crops, and generally bringing destruction to southern communities not yet exposed to the realities of war. His army killed relatively few people compared to that seen in other Civil War campaigns, as southern commanders could not field a sufficient force in Georgia to attack the federals in force. However, the psychological effect was monumental, and his capture of Savannah on December 21, 1864, electrified the north and convinced many southerners that the Confederacy was doomed.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P8'>After reaching Savannah, Sherman turned his army northward and marched through South Carolina, the first state to secede. His troops again burned buildings and crops on his way to Columbia. They captured the city on February 17, 1865, and the city burned that night and the next day. While many blamed Sherman’s Union soldiers for destroying South Carolina’s capital out of vengeance, some of the fires may have been caused by Confederate soldiers trying to destroy large stores of cotton before abandoning the city. Sherman then continued northward into North Carolina and defeated Joseph E. Johnston’s army shortly after Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P9'>Despite his reputation for destruction during the war, Sherman held no animosity toward former Confederates. In fact, his initial terms of surrender to Confederate forces in North Carolina were considered too lenient and were overruled by federal officials, who were especially enraged by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln only days earlier.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P10'>After the war, Sherman remained in the army and was promoted to lieutenant general. During the late 1860s, he oversaw U.S. military operations in the west against Native Americans. In 1869, after Grant won election as president of the United States, Sherman was promoted to full general and made Commanding General of the United States Army. He remained in that position until 1883. Three years before he retired, during a speech to a large crowd in Columbus, Ohio, Sherman stated, “There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.” Within months, the line had become immortalized as “War is hell.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P11'>Sherman spent his last years in New York City, attending social events and entertaining guests and notable public figures. Among the people he routinely conversed with was his former enemy, Joseph E. Johnston. The two ex-generals highly respected each other. Sherman was briefly considered as a candidate for president in 1884, but stated that he would refuse to serve in that office even if elected.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P12'>Sherman died on February 14, 1891, at the age of 71. Joseph E. Johnston attended a large funeral for Sherman in New York as an honorary pallbearer, and stood in the cold rain without a hat out of respect. When cautioned that he should cover up to prevent getting sick, Johnston reportedly said, “If I were in [Sherman’s] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat.” Johnston in fact did become sick shortly after Sherman’s funeral and passed away from pneumonia a few weeks later. Sherman's remains were transported to Missouri for final interment. Today he is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99666P0'>In warfare, an army moving into an enemy’s home territory is often described as an invasion. During the American Civil War, most examples of military forces moving into enemy territory involved Union armies advancing into Confederate states. Some of these incursions were temporary, such as small cavalry raids to destroy Confederate supplies and even larger campaigns behind Confederate lines to harm Southern infrastructure (such as William T. Sherman’s “March Through Georgia”). However, Union victory in the Civil War depended upon the United States Army conducting offensive operations and occupying large portions of the South. These efforts split apart the Confederacy, placed secessionist communities back under federal control, and reduced the Confederate armies’ ability to wage war. Pro-secessionist Southerners considered these efforts to be federal invasions, and described communities captured by Union armies as being overrun. However, pro-Union Southerners cheered the arrival of Union soldiers, considering them liberators rather than invaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99666P1'>Although the Confederacy fought a defensive war, Southern military forces occasionally conducted incursions into northern communities. Robert E. Lee’s Maryland Campaign in 1862 (which culminated in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862) was seen by many Marylanders as an invasion of their state. His second offensive campaign into the North, in the summer of 1863, was widely reported in the Northern press as a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. That campaign ultimately resulted in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
