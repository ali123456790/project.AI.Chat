                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013738P0'>An annual national holiday celebrated on the forth day of July, Independence Day celebrates the anniversary of the Second Continental Congress' ratification of the Declaration of Independence, the document which signaled the American colonies' separation from Great Britain. Following the American Civil War, Union veterans connected their Civil War military service to Independence Day celebrations as the the foremost important events in the nation's history to elevate their contemporary status and importance in U.S. history. Consequently, the Fourth of July became an important commemorative date for remembering the Civil War. (Stuart McConnel, <hi rend='italic'>Glorious Contentment</hi>, 85)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013738P1'>Relatedly, the Fourth of July was also celebrated in former Confederate states but almost exclusively by Black Americans. Freed people frequently celebrated the end of slavery on Independence Day, and in the process they cemented the importance of emancipation to the nation's history and it became a space for celebrating Black social, political, and economic accomplishment. However, in numerous instances white racist violence erupted in response to public celebrations of emancipation. Typically, white attendees became angered by Black celebrations of their freedom, which were tied to demands for racial equality. This resulted in violence, such as a race riot on the Fourth of July in Leavenworth, Kansas in 1865.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71308P0'><b>Native American History:</b> The Cambridge Dictionary defines a Native American person as "a member of one of the groups of people who were living in North and South America before Europeans arrived." (Cambridge Dictionary) Native Americans have a long and complicated history with the United States. Since the founding of the U.S., Native American tribes, incredibly diverse in language, government, religion, and culture, were barred from U.S. citizenship and treated as independent nations with whom the U.S. was required to act only through mutually agreed upon treaties and diplomatic measures. However, in practice, United States frequently employed deceit and violence to accomplish its aims with Native Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P1'>While Native Americans had lived on North American soil throughout the continent and in every part of what would become the U.S. since long before European settlers arrived, Native American-U.S. relations in the nineteenth century became the story of how the U.S. sought to remove Native Americans from that ancestral land and to colonize it for its own purposes. The largest, though certainly not the only, of these efforts came with the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which in seeking to open the rich soil of southeastern states like Mississippi to enslaved labor required Native Americans living there to relocate to reservations west of the Mississippi River. Indian Removal was a brutal process including extensive forced marches in terrible conditions.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P2'>While Native Americans fought on both sides of the American Civil War, the U.S. Army continued to violently force Native Americans further even from their reservation lands throughout the nineteenth century in a series of conflicts known generally as the "Indian Wars." Despite facing enormous legal, political, and military adversity as well as racism from the American populace, Native Americans often remained both in their original homelands as well as in reservations, working continually to right the historical wrongs committed by the federal government, establishing more equitable relationships to the U.S., and remaining an integral part of American history and life into the twenty-first century. (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P3'><b>Native American Naming Conventions:</b> Native Americans, also referred to as Indigenous people or American Indians, are the original inhabitants of North America. When Columbus sailed from Portugal, he intended to reach the Dutch East Indies, or what is today Singapore. Instead, he landed in the Caribbean and labeled the inhabitants “Los Indios.” (James A. Campbell, “Columbus and <hi rend='italic'>Los Indios</hi> as ‘God’s People’,” <hi rend='italic'>Los Angeles Times</hi>) Thus, the name became anglicized and “Indian” became common usage by Europeans after they arrived in North America. The term “American Indian” is used by the United States Federal Government and by the U.S. Census Bureau. The term Native American and Indigenous are more recent terminology that developed in the latter half of the 20th century, but not all Indigenous people in the U.S. agree to a single unified term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P4'><b>Legal Terminology:</b> Native Americans are incorporated into the U.S. legal system, as they are the only ethnic group explicitly mentioned in the <hi rend='italic'>U.S. Constitution</hi>. The commerce clause restricts individual states from dealing with “Indian Tribes.” (<hi rend='italic'>U.S. Constitution</hi>, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3) Instead, only the federal government can ratify treaties made with American Indians. While treaties are legally binding documents that outline how two governments should honor each other’s promises, they were ratified into law but rarely honored due to corruption or general ill-will. The case <hi rend='italic'>Cherokee v. Georgia</hi> in the 1830s ruled that American Indians are “Domestic Dependent Nations,”  therefore, they have the ability to govern themselves (sovereignty), but with curtailed authority. As a result, Native American sovereignty is frequently determined and redetermined by social events, court decisions, and politicians.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P5'>In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act also known as the Howard-Wheeler Act, giving tribes the ability to adopt constitutions by democratic vote. Some tribes adopted constitutions, while others rejected it. Each tribal community or nation has to be recognized by the U.S. Federal Government to receive services through the Bureau of Indian Affairs or to benefit from certain rights afforded to American Indians.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P6'><b>Native American’s Today:</b> The question of who is considered Native American is a controversial topic, as each tribal community has the sovereignty to determine their own membership. Some use lineal descent, residency, or Blood Quantum—or the calculation of full-blooded “Indian” ancestors in an individual’s lineage to determine a fraction like 1/4)—to determine enrollment in a federally recognized tribe. Today, Native Americans continue to work to achieve and protect sovereignty and the ability to direct their future for their communities. In the 1960s and 1970s, American Indians achieved self-determination—or the ability for tribes to govern themselves with minimal federal oversight—especially regarding treaty rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P7'>CWRGM recognizes the immense diversity of Native American tribes and their unique experiences and therefore uses the "Native Americans" tag to make those experiences more discoverable only in the absence of references to specific tribal names within its documents.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32003408P0'>The Choctaw Nation is a "North American Indian tribe of Muskogean linguistic stock that traditionally lived in what is now southeastern Mississippi." (Britannica) The Choctaw origin story describes a migration from the West into what is now Mississippi, the place they traditionally have considered their divinely appointed ancestral home. A large nation with roughly 20,000 members in the mid-seventeenth century, early Choctaw society was structured matrilineally, as Choctaw leaders and families traced their descent through females. The Choctaw were skilled farmers with unique and complex religious, funerary, and celebratory traditions. While the Choctaw allied with different European colonies at different times in their history, Choctaw oral histories traditionally focus on battles with their Native American neighbors the Creek Nation, and the geographically and culturally close Chickasaw Nation (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The Choctaw Nation became the first Native American nation in the southeastern United States to be removed from their homeland as a result of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830. Many Choctaw, however, remained in Mississippi under the treaty's promise that they would receive a substantial 640-acre tract of land in exchange for becoming American citizens. However, many Choctaws never received that land and faced racial and economic discrimination throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Despite these challenges, many Choctaws remained and still remain in Mississippi, forming an integral part of the state's economic, political, and social history (Britannica; Mississippi Encyclopedia).
