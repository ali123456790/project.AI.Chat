                    <p xml:id='OTPS71087P0'>Winfield Scott Featherston was a U.S. congressman from Mississippi and a general in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P1'>Born on August 8, 1820, near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Featherston volunteered for militia service as a teenager during the Second Creek War in Alabama in 1836. After that conflict, he moved to Mississippi and studied law, becoming a practicing attorney in 1840. Soon after, Featherston became involved in local politics, and won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi in 1846. He served until 1851, then returned to his home in Houston, Mississippi, after losing reelection in 1850. In 1856, he moved to Holly Springs and opened a successful law firm.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P2'>Featherston remained a political figure in Mississippi, particularly during the secession movement following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860. He traveled to Kentucky, as an agent of Mississippi, to encourage secession in that state. When the war broke out in 1861, Featherston received a commission as a colonel and took command of the Seventeenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Sent to Virginia, he led Confederate troops at the First Battle of Bull Run and Ball’s Bluff in Virginia. He was promoted to brigadier general in March 1862 and participated in several major engagements that year, including the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond, the Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P3'>In early 1863, Featherston was transferred to Mississippi. He commanded a brigade during the Vicksburg campaign, seeing combat at Champion’s Hill, and participated in the Atlanta Campaign in 1864. He remained with General John Bell Hood’s army during the disastrous campaign into Tennessee in late 1864, and commanded a brigade in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army during the final weeks of the war in the Carolinas. He surrendered to Union troops in late April 1865, was paroled shortly afterwards, and returned to Holly Springs, Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P4'>Featherston immediately returned to politics after the war, running an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate. He practiced law, and remained active in local political activities opposing Republican Reconstruction. In 1876, he won a seat in the Mississippi legislature and remained there until 1882, when he received an appointment as a district judge. One of his final political acts was as a delegate to Mississippi’s 1890 constitutional convention, which reinstituted many discriminatory policies against African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P5'>Featherston was married to Elizabeth McEwen and had seven children. He died in 1891 and is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25015672P0'>James Longstreet was a Confederate general during the Civil War and a Republican official in the south during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P1'>Born on January 8, 1821, in Edgefield District, South Carolina, Longstreet moved to Georgia at the age of nine. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1842. He was a poor student, graduating almost at the bottom of his class, due to his rowdiness and interest in non-academic activities. He was popular, though, and became good friends with several other cadets who would become leading military figures during the Civil War, including future Confederate generals D. H. Hill and George Pickett, and future Union generals George Thomas, William Rosecrans, and John Pope. One of his best friends from West Point was Ulysses S. Grant and the two served together in the Fourth U.S. Infantry Regiment after graduation. Grant married one of Longstreet’s cousins, Julia Dent, and some accounts say that Longstreet served as a groomsman in the wedding.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P2'>Longstreet served as an officer with the Eighth U.S. Infantry Regiment during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848. He performed very well, receiving multiple brevet (honorary) promotions for bravery. At the Battle of Chapultepec, he carried his regiment’s flag in an attack upon a Mexican position, but was shot in the thigh. Unable to continue, Longstreet handed the flag to his friend and West Point classmate George Pickett. After several months of recovering from his wound, Longstreet returned to stateside military service. He married Louise Garland in March 1848 and the couple eventually had ten children. During the 1850s, Longstreet received a variety of assignments, at military posts in New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. He was in Albuquerque serving as a U.S. Army paymaster during the secession crisis that following Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P3'>Following the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, Longstreet resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. Although not a strong supporter of secession, as a native of South Carolina and having spent much of his youth in Georgia, he told his northern comrades that he felt obligated to follow the south. He was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate army in May 1861. He received a promotion to brigadier general in June 1861 and was placed in command of a brigade of Virginians that summer. He participated an engagement at Blackburn’s Ford near Manassas, only three days before the First Battle of Bull Run, and received praise for his bravery. Promoted to major general in October 1861, he received command of a division in the Army of Northern Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P4'>He continued to perform well in several battle in 1862, despite suffering a personal tragedy with three of his children dying of scarlet fever earlier that year. During the Seven Days Battles near Richmond in the spring of 1862, Longstreet commanded nearly half of the army and received praise from his superiors and subordinates. Robert E. Lee took over the Army of Northern Virginia during that campaign, beginning a very close partnership with Longstreet as commander of the army’s Right Wing (later known as the First Corps). At the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862, Longstreet led his command in a crushing attack on the Union army’s left flank, scoring a stunning Confederate victory, and he performed well defending the Confederate line at the Battle of Antietam and the Battle of Fredericksburg. In late 1862, he received a promotion to lieutenant general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P5'>Longstreet disagreed with Lee on the invasion of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1863. Nevertheless, he dutifully followed Lee’s orders in the Battle of Gettysburg, culminating in the disastrous Confederate assault on the Union center on July 3, 1863, famously known as “Pickett’s Charge.” Longstreet had advised against the assault, but facing direct orders from Lee, had given his old U.S. Army friend George Pickett the signal to lead the charge. Longstreet criticized Lee’s actions at Gettysburg, which upset many of his comrades and people across the south due to Lee’s iconic fame in the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P6'>In the fall of 1863, Longstreet received instructions to lead his corps to reinforce Confederate forces near Chattanooga, Tennessee. He arrived in time to play a key role in the Battle of Chickamauga. Although a Confederate victory, fighting among the generals—including between Longstreet and Braxton Bragg—soured Longstreet’s experience in the western theater. Additionally, his effort to defeat Union forces under General Ambrose Burnside at Knoxville, Tennessee, in December 1863 ended badly and he eventually led his troops back to rejoin Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P7'>In 1864, Longstreet returned to his old style of success in battle, handling his soldiers well during the Battle of the Wilderness in Virginia. However, he was badly wounded by friendly fire, which paralyzed his right arm and forced him to spend several months recovering. He returned to the army in October 1864 and helped the Army of Northern Virginia defend Petersburg from Union forces commanded by his old friend Ulysses S. Grant. Longstreet continued to serve in Virginia until Lee’s army was defeated and forced to surrender at Appomattox Court House in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P8'>Following the Civil War, Longstreet moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. He worked in cotton sales and became an executive in various railroad projects. Although largely a Confederate hero during the war, Longstreet’s reputation in the south suffered tremendously when he began supporting Republican policies during Reconstruction. His views were not particularly progressive, as he did not embrace Black civil rights to the degree that northern Republicans did. Instead, he argued that southern whites should join the Republican Party to help control that organization and its Black members. As time went on, though, Longstreet continued to support Republican policies, including greater protections for African Americans. He endorsed Grant for president in 1868 and he received an appointment by Grant a surveyor of customs in New Orleans. He also received a commission a major general in the Louisiana militia, which included commanding Black soldiers in opposition to white conservative violence during the late Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015672P9'>Many former Confederate generals ostracized Longstreet for his criticism of Lee and embrace of the Republican Party. As such, he was not celebrated in the “Lost Cause” mythology that romanticized the Confederacy and lionized generals like Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. However, Longstreet continued to attend veteran reunions for many years, and remained popular with many of the men who had served under him. His first wife died in 1889 and in 1897, at 75 years old, he married 34-year old Helen Dortch.  Longstreet died on January 2, 1904. He is buried in Alta Vista Cemetery in Gainesville, Georgia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS64002P0'>William Barksdale was a U.S. congressman who later served as a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P1'>Born on August 21, 1821, in Smyrna, Tennessee, Barksdale graduated from the University of Nashville and moved to Mississippi to practice law. He eventually left his law practice to edit the <hi rend='italic'>Columbus Democrat</hi>, a pro-Democratic Party, pro-slavery newspaper in Columbus, Mississippi. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Barksdale joined the Second Mississippi Regiment, serving as a quartermaster (supply officer).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P2'>After leaving Mexico, Barksdale returned to Mississippi and entered the political arena. He supported the Compromise of 1850, the controversial agreement among northern and southern politicians over the matter of slavery in the territories won from Mexico after the Mexican-American War. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1852, and served in Congress until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Barksdale was an outspoken defender of slavery in Congress, being present in several high profile debates and incidents on Capitol Hill. This included Representative Preston Brooks’ assault upon Senator Charles Sumner in the U.S. Senate on May 22, 1856. Brooks, a pro-slavery Democrat from South Carolina, had taken offense to an anti-slavery speech by the senator from Massachusetts. He walked up behind Sumner and began beating him with his cane, nearly killing him. The “caning of Charles Sumner” marked another polarizing incident in the brewing political battle over slavery, and Barksdale was reportedly standing next to Brooks during the attack. Barksdale was part of another physical altercation between anti-slavery and pro-slavery representatives in Congress two years later. During the fight, a northern congressman tried to restrain Barksdale and inadvertently knocked his toupee off. When the Mississippian quickly and awkwardly replaced the hair piece on his head backwards, laughter broke out and ended the brawl.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P3'>After Mississippi seceded in January 1861, Barksdale resigned his seat in Congress and volunteered for state military service. He was commissioned a brigadier general and appointed adjutant general and then quartermaster general of the Mississippi Militia. Soon afterwards he transferred to the Confederate States Army as a colonel and commanded the Thirteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment at the First Battle of Bull Run. Over the next two years he participated in several other battles in the Eastern Theater, including the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. After his brigade commander was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savage’s Station, he took over command and performed well, being promoted to brigadier general and leading to the brigade proudly being known as “Barksdale’s Mississippi Brigade.” Over the next few months Barksdale led his brigade at Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P4'>Barksdale commanded his brigade at Gettysburg in July 1863. He led his troops during the sudden Confederate assault on the Union left flank on July 2, striking federal troops at the Peach Orchard and pressing them back. During the vicious fighting, Barksdale was shot in the knee, struck in the foot by a cannon ball, and then shot in the chest.  Knocked off his horse by the final wound, Barksdale reportedly told a staff officer, “I am killed!

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the first military drafts occurred during the American Civil War, in which both the Union and Confederate governments issued conscription laws.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P1'>The Confederacy, receiving fewer enlistments than it expected at the beginning of the war, passed the First Conscription Act in April 1862, rendering all able-bodied white males between the ages of 18 and 35 eligible to be compelled into military service, but it included a provision by which a draftee could hire a substitute or obtain an exemption. Fearing insurrections by the enslaved population, the Confederacy passed a Second Conscription Act in September 1862 exempting one white enslaver for every twenty enslaved persons on a property, also known as the "Twenty Slave Law". Both the substitute and twenty slave laws isolated impoverished white southerners and rendered the draft deeply unpopular among non-elite southerners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P2'>In the North, conscription began in July 1862 when Congress authorized the president to enlist any militia company into the United States' service. Conscription extended to the general public in March 1863 with the Enrollment Act, rendering any able-bodied white male citizen or immigrant between the ages of 20 and 45 subject to the draft. This law similarly included a provision allowing one to purchase a substitute or commutation for the then-sizeable fee of $300. Draftees could also be exempt by proving that they were the sole support of family members or other dependents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P3'>Many individuals in the North and South saw their respective drafts as affronts to the freedom and individual liberties upon which the United States was founded, while tensions also arose between those of different races, ethnicities, religions, and social classes that were differently represented in the draft. The draft also brought home the realities of war to many families, North and South, who relied on men to support them, as fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers were sent to fight, where they would make the little money paid to soldiers and possibly lose their lives. Conscription in the American Civil War led to the violence of the New York Draft Riots of July 1863, and resulted in widespread and varied resistance in North and South (Bill of Rights Institute).
