                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P0'>The act of beginning to fight or a period of time in a war, military engagements are also referred to as battles or skirmishes. Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P1'>There were approximately 10,500 engagements during the American Civil War. Fifty of them were major battles, while another one hundred were notable engagements. The rest were small battles or skirmishes. (Cambridge Dictionary; American Battlefield Trust)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD104719P0'>The Battle of Shiloh (also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing) was fought on April 6 – 7, 1862 in Hardin County, Tennessee between the Army of the Tennessee (Union) commanded by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant against the Army of Mississippi (Confederate) commanded by Gen. Sidney Albert Johnston, and later, by Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard. It resulted in a Union victory. After the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson in February of 1862, Johnston withdrew Confederate forces from Kentucky and central and western Tennessee, opening Mississippi and Alabama to attack from the Union Army. Johnston suspected that Grant would attack Corinth, Mississippi, the hub of the Ohio and Mobile and Memphis and Charleston railroads, an important Confederate supply route. He gathered his forces at Corinth and marched north to Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee to attack Grant before Union reinforcements could arrive.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD104719P1'>Fighting began on the morning of April 6. Initially, Johnston’s forces had the element of surprise, attacking Union soldiers at their camp and driving them back toward Pittsburgh Landing. Union forces regrouped and counter-attacked. That afternoon, Johnston was shot in his knee, the ball severing an artery and killing him from blood loss. Command fell to Beauregard who believed his forces were victorious and ordered the attack halted as darkness fell that evening. Grant, receiving reinforcements overnight, launched an attack on the morning of April 7. Beauregard counter-attacked, but the two sides reached a stalemate. That afternoon Beauregard realized that Grant was reinforced, and he was outnumbered. He retreated with his forces to Corinth. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 110,053; 65,085 Union and 44,968 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 23,746 with 13,047 Union and 10,669 Confederate. The Confederate defeat at Shiloh gave the Union access to several hundred miles of the Mississippi River to launch operations further into to South. Also of note, Sidney Albert Johnston would be the highest-ranking Confederate general killed in the war (American Battlefield Trust; Tennessee Encyclopedia; Encyclopedia Britannica)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
