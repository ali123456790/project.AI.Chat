                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74655P0'>Sterling Price was a U.S. politician before the Civil War and then a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P1'>Born in September 1809 in Prince Edward County, Virginia, Price received a moderate education and studied law in Virginia before moving to Missouri around 1830. He entered local politics and in 1836 won election to Missouri’s House of Representatives. He joined the state militia and stepped away from the legislature to participate in anti-Mormon military activities in the state in the late 1830s. After the Mormon conflict, Price focused on farming a large amount of land he had received from his father in Missouri. He owned several dozen slaves during this period, and became a strong advocate for the institution of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P2'>In 1842, Price again entered the Missouri legislature. Then, in 1844, he successfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives. When the Mexican-American War started in 1846, he volunteered for military service and took command of the Second Missouri Mounted Infantry Regiment. In early 1847, Price was sent to New Mexico, where he defeated an insurrection by Pueblo and Hispano people, and was then appointed military governor over the territory. He then saw some combat against a small Mexican force at the very end of the Mexican-American War. Price returned to Missouri as a war hero, which he used for political gain, becoming governor in 1853. Among the more notable developments that occurred during his four years in office include the creation of Washington University in St. Louis and the expansion of railroad development. Price spent the latter part of the 1850s as Missouri’s Bank Commissioner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P3'>Price publicly opposed secession in the wake of Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860. He presided over Missouri’s convention in February 1861, which voted to remain in the Union. However, he privately worked with pro-secessionist governor Claiborne Fox Jackson to strengthen the Missouri militia in support of the Confederacy. When federal forces under Nathaniel Lyon clashed with the militiamen near St. Louis in May 1861, Price formally backed the Confederacy. Taking command of the Missouri State Guard and pro-secession forces, he defeated a Union army under Lyon at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek in August 1861. He then saw battlefield success at Lexington, Missouri, in September 1861. Commissioned as a major general in the Confederate Army in March 1862, he was defeated in battle at Pea Ridge, Arkansas, and then lost at Iuka and Corinth in Mississippi. Price continued to lead Confederate troops in minor engagements in 1863, and then carried out an ambitious offensive campaign into Missouri and Kansas in late 1864. He scored several minor victories during the campaign, but was defeated at Westport, near modern-day Kansas City, Missouri. Price’s army retreated southward along the Kansas-Missouri border, losing additional engagements and withdrawing into Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P4'>Price chose to go into Mexico rather than surrender to Union forces in 1865. He and several ex-Confederates tried to create a colony in Carlota, Veracruz. In 1866, after Mexican officials proved unsupportive of the colony, Price returned to Missouri. He suffered from numerous health problems, many related to conditions he had contracted during his various military experiences over the previous years, including cholera. He died on September 29, 1867. Price was married to Martha Head and had six children who survived to adulthood. He is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

<p xml:id='OTPS25007118P1'>Born on December 1, 1816, in Elbert County, Georgia, Harris graduated from the University of Georgia in 1836 and moved to Mississippi in 1840. He became a wealthy planter, owning several slaves, in Lowndes County. During the 1850s, Harris became involved in state politics, winning election to the Mississippi Senate in 1858.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25007118P2'>He held his seat until 1861 and then volunteered for military service during the first year of the Civil War. He served as a brigadier general from 1862 to 1863, leading state troops during the Vicksburg Campaign. Harris and his brigade were captured by Ulysses S. Grant’s army at Vicksburg in July 1863. He was formally exchanged as a prisoner a few weeks later and mustered out of the military. Harris remained a civilian for a year and then returned to the military in 1864, receiving a commission as a colonel in charge of forces at Macon, Mississippi. He remained there until the end of the Civil War in 1865.

<p xml:id='OTPS25007118P3'>After the Civil War, Harris returned to his land in Lowndes County, Mississippi. He died there on November 21, 1899. Harris was married to Mary Oliver Banks and had three children who survived to adulthood. He is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
