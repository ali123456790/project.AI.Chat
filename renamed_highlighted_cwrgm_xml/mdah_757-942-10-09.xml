                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52585P0'>Daniel Ruggles was a Confederate general during the Civil War. Born in Barre, Massachusetts, on January 31, 1810, Ruggles grew up in the north and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating from West Point in 1833, he served at a variety of U.S. Army posts in the west and south, and participated in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He was promoted to captain in 1846, during the Mexican-American War, and fought in several battles, including at Vera Cruz, Chapultepec, and Mexico City. He remained in the army during the 1850s, taking part in a military campaign against Mormon settlers over governance of Utah Territory, before taking leave due to health reasons.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P1'>When the Civil War erupted in early 1861, Ruggles resigned his commission. Although he was from Massachusetts, he had married Richardetta Barnes Mason Hooe, from Virginia, and sympathized with the secessionist cause. He received a commission with the Virginia militia and assisted in the defense of Chesapeake Bay from U.S. Navy activity. Appointed brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the summer of 1861, Ruggles was sent to command a brigade in General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Pensacola. He had been placed in charge of a division within Bragg’s army when it moved into Mississippi to join General Albert Sidney Johnston’s Army of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P2'>On April 6, 1862, Johnston’s Confederates attacked Union soldiers under Ulysses S. Grant at Pittsburgh Landing along the Tennessee River in southwest Tennessee. The battle became more popularly known as Shiloh, due to a nearby church by that name. The Confederate assault was initially successful, pushing the Union soldiers back toward the river. However, some federal troops managed to hold a defensive position against repeated attacks. The scene was called the ”Hornets Nest” due to the intensity of the fighting. Ruggles called for every Confederate cannon to assemble and fire into the Union position. The result was a line of 62 Confederate cannons—the largest concentration of artillery in North America at the time—nicknamed “Ruggles’s Battery,” firing for hours into the “Hornets Nest” until the Union soldiers retreated. Despite the Confederate success the first day, Albert Sidney Johnston was mortally wounded and Grant’s troops rallied the following day to force the southern soldiers back, resulting in a Union victory.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P3'>Following Shiloh, Ruggles battled Union soldiers in Mississippi and Louisiana. He participated in an unsuccessful campaign to recapture Baton Rouge from federal forces and a failed Confederate attempt to secure the town of Corinth, Mississippi. Although southern defeats, Ruggles had performed well. He spent the rest of the war in administrative positions, including being appointed head of the prison system, overseeing the final exchange of Union prisoners when the war ended.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P4'>After the Civil War, Ruggles moved to Virginia where he took up farming and real estate business. He died in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on June 1, 1897, and is buried in the Confederate City in that town.  He and his wife Richardetta had four sons, three of which survived to adulthood.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25002719P0'>Martin Luther Smith was a northern-born Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P1'>Born September 9, 1819, in Danby New York, Smith graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1842. His first military assignment was as a civil engineer in the U.S. Army in Florida. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Smith served as an engineer and cartographer, drawing detailed maps for U.S. commanders, such as General Winfield Scott, during campaigns in Mexico.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P2'>Smith was still in the U.S. Army when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Although born in the north, he was sympathetic to the southern secession and the Confederacy. He had married a woman from Georgia and spent most of his military career in the south. As a result, he resigned from the army and volunteered for Confederate service. Initially commissioned a major in the engineers, he was promoted to colonel and assigned command of the Twenty-first Louisiana Infantry Regiment in February 1862. After assisting in planning the defense of New Orleans, Louisiana, Smith was promoted to brigadier general and transferred back to the engineers. In May 1862, he was placed in command of the defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and remained there during Ulysses S. Grant’s 1863 campaign, siege, and capture of the city. Held as a prisoner until early 1864, Smith received command of the Confederate Army’s Engineer Corps after his parole from a Union prison camp. In April 1864, he received an appointment as the chief engineer for the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee. Confederate officials then moved him to different commands, including the Army of Tennessee and then the Confederate Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. Among his last assignment was overseeing the defenses of Mobile, Alabama, under General P. G. T. Beauregard. When Union troops captured Mobile in 1865, Smith traveled to Athens, Georgia, where he surrendered in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P3'>After the Civil War, Smith moved to Savannah, Georgia, and began a civil engineering firm. He also served as the chief engineer of the Selma, Rome, and Dalton Railroad. Smith passed away on July 29, 1866 at the age of 46. He had been married to Sarah Evalina Nisbet and had three children. Smith is buried at Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens, Georgia.

On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P0'>As the American Civil War extended into its third year, the Confederate government found itself deeply indebted and unable to provide food, clothing, and other necessities for its army. On March 26, 1863, the Confederate government passed the Impressment Law. Under this law, state boards of impressment, with the assistance of local commissioners, impressed food, fuel, enslaved persons, and other commodities to support the war effort and to pay off its debts. Commissioners met with local farmers to fix prices for their commodities, subject to revision every two months. One month later, the Confederate government enacted a tax-in-kind. The tax-in-kind required farmers to donate ten percent (to be judged by a collector) of their produce in lieu of taxes paid in currency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P1'>Both of these policies increased tensions between white southerners and the Confederate government. Farmers and their families often felt cheated by government agents offering far less than market value for their goods. Areas close to fighting also disproportionately experienced impressment, as Confederate armies on the ground often stripped their farms clean. The Confederacy also impressed enslaved persons to perform labor, and the brutality of that labor often resulted in the death, injury, or mistreatment of the enslaved, who, if returned at all, did so in much worse condition than they left. The Confederate government also routinely failed to pay for impressed goods and kept enslaved persons longer than their agreed impressment period. Impressment, then, led to protests among rural white southerners, some of whom hoarded their goods from collectors or impersonated collectors in order to acquire food for themselves and their families. The tax-in-kind alone garnered roughly $62 million for the Confederacy from 1863 to 1865, yet combined with impressment, these policies alienated much of the Confederacy's local support and failed to fully pay its debts or win the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004747P0'>The Confederacy extended the practice of hiring enslaved persons, common in urban areas of the Upper South throughout the antebellum period, to its war industries during the American Civil War (1861-1865). Early in the war, private companies involved in war industries like ironworks, as well as some military departments and individual soldiers, hired enslaved laborers in the absence of white employees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004747P1'>However, after the Confederate Impressment Law of March 26, 1863, the Confederate government impressed thousands of enslaved persons to work on its fortifications. Enslaved persons endured awful living and working conditions during their impressments, and the mortality and illness rates among impressed enslaved persons soared. Fearful of an enslaved uprising, Confederate officials restricted the few freedoms previously afforded the enslaved. Impressed enslaved persons also faced increased rates of separation from their wives and children, who were then forced to work harder in their absence.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004747P2'>However, many impressed enslaved persons manipulated the displacement of impressment to their favor, escaping from fortifications and thereby self-emancipating. Impressment also angered many enslaving white Southerners. The Confederate government often failed to pay for or return impressed enslaved persons after their agreed-upon periods of impressment and returned others weakened by sickness and overwork. The Confederacy's widespread impressment of the enslaved thereby created division among Southerners at a pivotal time in the war when battlefield losses had already depleted morale. Regardless, the Confederate government ultimately requested 20,000 enslaved persons in 1864 alone, subject to impressment. (Encyclopedia Virginia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
