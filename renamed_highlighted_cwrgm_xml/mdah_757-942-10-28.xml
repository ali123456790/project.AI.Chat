                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P0'>The act of beginning to fight or a period of time in a war, military engagements are also referred to as battles or skirmishes. Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P1'>There were approximately 10,500 engagements during the American Civil War. Fifty of them were major battles, while another one hundred were notable engagements. The rest were small battles or skirmishes. (Cambridge Dictionary; American Battlefield Trust)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25010627P0'>The Battle of Antietam (also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg) was fought on September 17, 1862 near the town of Sharpsburg, Washington County, Maryland between the Army of the Potomac (Union) commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and the Army of Northern Virginia (Confederate) commanded by Gen. Robert E. Lee and resulted in a Union victory. Emboldened by the Union defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run, Lee’s Maryland Campaign drove the ANV into the North to threaten Washington D.C. and influence the November 1862 midterm elections. The total number of forces engaged in the battle were 132,000; 87,000 Union and 45,000 Confederate. The battle has the distinction of being the bloodiest day in American history, with an estimated 27,717 casualties, 12,401 Union and 10,316 Confederate. Also of note was the death of six generals in the battle, three Union and three Confederate. President Abraham Lincoln used the occasion of the Union victory in the battle to issue his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862.

Gen. John Pope and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia commanded by Gen. Robert E. Lee and resulted in a Confederate Victory. Pope moved his army into central Virginia to take pressure off Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan’s Army of the Potomac after the failed Peninsula Campaign to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond. Lee took the initiative and moved the ANV into position to attack Pope after learning McClellan’s army was leaving the peninsula to join up with Pope’s forces. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 125,000; 70,000 Union and 55,000 Confederate. casualties from the battle were estimated at 21,849 with 14,462 Union and 7,387 Confederate.

Johnston attacked the Union forces along the Chickahominy River on May 31. Both sides reinforced their positions and suffered heavy casualties. The Confederates were unable to advance on the Union position and retreated on June 1, 1862. During the fighting, Johnston was seriously wounded. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 73,000; 34,000 Union and 39,000 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 13,736 with 5,739 Union and 7,997 Confederate.

Gen. George B. McClellan and the Army of Northern Virginia commanded by Gen. Robert E. Lee and resulted in a Confederate victory.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25011183P0'>The Battle of Malvern Hill was fought on July 2, 1862 in Henrico County, Virginia between the Army of the Potomac (Union), commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and the Army of Northern Virginia (Confederate), commanded by Gen. Robert. E. Lee. It was the final engagement of the Seven Days Battles during the Peninsula Campaign and resulted in a Union victory. McClellan took the position on Malvern Hill to hold off Lee’s ANV before his retreat to his supply base at Harrison’s Landing. Union artillery was placed on Malvern Hill pointing in three directions. At 1:00 pm the two sides engaged in an artillery duel. The Confederates launched a series of unsuccessful infantry assaults on the Union position. By 8:30 pm, Union artillery fire ceased, and the battle concluded. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 57,000; 27,000 Union and 30,000 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 7,700 with 2,100 Union and 5,600 Confederate. Although a Union victory, McClellan believed his Army of the Potomac was vastly outnumbered by Lee’s forces and abandoned his plans to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, ending his Peninsula Campaign.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25011184P0'>The Battle of South Mountain (also known as the Battle of Boonsboro Gap) was fought on September 14, 1862 in Frederick and Washington counties, Maryland between the Army of the Potomac (Union) commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and the Army of Northern Virginia (Confederate) commanded by Gen. Robert E. Lee. It was part of the Maryland Campaign and resulted in a Union victory. On September 13 at a campsite previously used by the Confederates, Union forces discovered Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill’s copy of Lee’s Special Orders 191. The plan detailed how Lee divided his ANV to conduct operations in Maryland. Acting on this intelligence, McClellan marched his army to the South Mountain range to attack the isolated wings of Lee’s army before it could regroup, meeting Lee’s forces at Fox’s, Turner’s, and Crampton’s Gaps on September 14. By nightfall, the Confederate lines had held at Fox’s and Turner’s Gaps, however, Crampton’s Gap fell under Union control. Outnumbered, Lee withdrew his forces overnight, regrouping his divided army at Sharpsburg, Maryland leading to the Battle of Antietam on September 17. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 46,000; 28,000 Union and 18,000 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 5,010 with 2,325 Union and 2,685 Confederate.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
