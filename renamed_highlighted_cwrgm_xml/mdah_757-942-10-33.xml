                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS95215P0'>Pierre Soule Layton was a Confederate officer and chief of ordnance of the Mississippi State Militia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P1'>Born on January 18, 1839, in Charleston, South Carolina, Layton graduated from the South Carolina State Military Academy. Shortly afterwards he moved to Mississippi and became superintendent of the Brandon State Military Institute. He served as captain in a Mississippi militia artillery unit from Brandon. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Layton volunteered for military service and was appointed chief of ordnance for the Mississippi State Militia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P2'>In the fall of 1861, he was elected lieutenant colonel of the Fourth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, which entered Confederate service and marched to Tennessee. The regiment participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson, and was captured by Ulysses S. Grant’s troops who surrounded the fort in February 1862. Layton and the other members of the regiment were held as prisoners of war until exchanged by Union and Confederate officials that fall. The Fourth Mississippi Infantry reassembled in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, in October 1862. The original commander resigned his commission and Layton was elected colonel and placed in command. Layton and the regiment participated in the Vicksburg Campaign, and was again captured by soldiers under Grant, in July 1863. After being exchanged this second time, the soldiers of the Fourth Mississippi Infantry joined Braxton Bragg’s army at Chattanooga. Layton departed the regiment by the time it participated in the Atlanta Campaign in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P3'>After the war Layton settled in Meridian, Mississippi. He held a variety of jobs, including an insurance agent, writer and editor of a newspaper, cartographer and civil engineer, and chief engineer of the Waynesboro, Pascagoula and Gulf Coast Railroad.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P4'>On November 5, 1878, Layton became involved in a deadly dispute with the sheriff of Lauderdale County, Robert Henderson. On a street in Meridian, Mississippi, Layton and Henderson engaged in a gun battle.  Henderson was shot twice in the legs, and Layton was immediately arrested.  He was subsequently convicted of assault with intent to kill. He was sentenced to seven years in the state’s penitentiary. However, he was acquitted after an appeal in 1879.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P5'>Layton moved to Andalusia, Alabama, late in life and died there on April 2, 1906. His death was likely a suicide, as witnesses said he consumed a large amount of alcohol and then an ounce of laudanum (an opiate). One report noted that he apparently was experiencing family problems. Layton had been married three times, the first of which apparently ended in divorce. He had at least five children who survived to adulthood.  Layton is buried in Mount Zion Cemetery in Wayne County, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077641P0'>A resignation is the formal act of leaving, or quitting, a position. During the nineteenth century, military officers typically could resign from service if they had fulfilled the conditions of their commission (or contract). Enlisted soldiers were not permitted to resign.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077641P1'>Resignations were relatively common before the American Civil War, by officers who saw little chance for promotion in the small, highly competitive officer corps, or by those who sought to find their fortune outside the military. There was little stigma attached to resigning, and numerous officers returned to military service in times of war. For instance, George McClellan and Ulysses S. Grant—two of the Union’s most prominent generals—had resigned their military commissions in the 1850s, yet returned to service in 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077641P2'>Southern secession and the beginning of the Civil War sparked a wave of resignations from the U.S. Army.  Of 1,080 officers on active duty in the regular army in 1861, 286 resigned (or were dismissed) to enter Confederate service. Most famous among these was Robert E. Lee, who submitted his resignation to the Secretary of War on April 20, 1861, three days after his home state of Virginia seceded. Some other officers in the U.S. Army in 1861 resigned not to switch political sides, but to better their chances of promotion. The overwhelming majority of Union soldiers during the Civil War were part of the state-based volunteer force. Since promotion was slow in the small permanent army, these ambitious officers resigned to accept positions with the volunteers, and frequently found themselves advancing rapidly in rank.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077641P3'>Resignations continued to occur among Confederate and Union officers during the war. Reasons ranged from health problems, to distaste of military service, to seeking opportunities elsewhere, to leaving the military out of shame or a sense of responsibility for a battlefield defeat. Sometimes resignations were more symbolic than sincere, and military officials were not required to accept a resignation. Robert E. Lee offered his resignation to Confederate President Jefferson Davis following the loss at Gettysburg. Davis rejected the resignation and Lee continued to command his Army of Northern Virginia for nearly two more years. (Wikipedia; <hi rend='italic'>American Military History</hi>, 188-192)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD68643P0'>Military elections were a common practice within volunteer and militia units of both the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War, a tradition with its roots going back to the Revolutionary War. These elections took place at the company and regimental levels. Company officers were elected by the unit’s soldiers, and in turn, these company officers elected the regiment’s Colonel, Lt. Colonel, and Majors. Officially, Governors had the authority to appoint a Colonel to command a regiment but usually deferred to the officer elected by the regiment's men. Often, these elections put men without military experience or otherwise unqualified to lead their units into battle with disastrous outcomes. Also, junior officers found it difficult to enforce military discipline as they were beholden to the soldiers for their position, which they could be voted out of.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD68643P1'>Union and Confederate authorities sought to limit the detrimental effects of these officer elections. On July 22, 1861, the day after the Union loss at the First Battle of Bull Run, the United States Congress authorized an examination board for officers. Many were deemed unfit and removed, while others resigned. The Confederate Congress established a similar board on October 13, 1862. Military elections continued during the war but to a lesser extent due to government oversight on both sides. They eventually ended in favor of ensuring qualified officers were put in command positions. (James M. McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</hi>; <hi rend='italic'>Public Laws of the Confederate States of America</hi>, 1862 Public Laws, S2, 85-87; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

Beauregard and served in the Western Theater. On March 13, 1862 units of the Army of Pensacola were added to it, and it was consolidated with the Army of Central Kentucky and the Army of Louisiana on March 29, 1862. It was later commanded by Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, Gen. Braxton Bragg, Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee, and Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk. It was renamed the Army of Tennessee on November 20, 1862.

The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of Southern History</hi>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
