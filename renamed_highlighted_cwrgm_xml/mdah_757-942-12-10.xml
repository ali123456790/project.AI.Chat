                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25010344P0'>Edmund Kirby Smith was a veteran of the U.S. Mexican War and a Confederate Army general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P1'>Born on May 16, 1824 in St. Augustine, Florida, Smith graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York in 1845. Smith entered the U.S. Mexican War with a rank of second lieutenant in the 7th U.S. Infantry. After the war, Smith became a teacher of mathematics at West Point, and he worked as a botanist. He pursued botany throughout the rest of his life. However, in 1855, he was appointed captain of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry and was stationed in Texas, and in May 1859, he was injured while fighting the Comanche in Kansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P2'>When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Smith was a major in the U.S. Army, and he initially refused to cooperate with Texas's secession and its order for him to surrender his troops. However, in April, he resigned his commission and entered the Confederate Army with a rank of major in the regular artillery. That same day, he was transferred to a cavalry unit, carrying the rank of lieutenant colonel. By June, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and was in command of a brigade in the Army of the Shenandoah. Wounded during the First Battle of Manassas (also known as Bull Run), Smith was reassigned to the Department of Middle and East Florida until he recovered. On October 11, he returned to active duty and was promoted to the rank of major general and was made a division commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P3'>In 1862, he was reassigned to the Army of Mississippi (also known as the Army of Tennessee) and took part in the invasion of Kentucky. Smith was awarded for his leadership during the Battle of Richmond in Kentucky (August 30, 1862), and by the end of the year, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P4'>In 1863, Smith was reassigned once again, this time relocating to Shreveport, Louisiana as commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, which included Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, western Louisiana, and the western territories. This included approximately 30,000 men under his command, and after the fall of Vicksburg, Smith was essentially cut off from the rest of the Confederacy. The area became known as "Kirby Smithdom" as a nod to Smith's reputation as a military dictator. He conducted the war west of the Mississippi largely through guerilla warfare and was unable to combat the U.S. Navy's control of the Mississippi River or aid the Confederate Army in the east. In February 1864, he was promoted to the rank of general (one of seven in the Confederate Army). He surrendered his army on May 26, 1865, making him the last full general to surrender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P5'>After the war, Smith fled the country for Cuba, but he returned to the U.S. to take the oath of allegiance on November 14, 1865. Smith returned to higher education and entered the telegraph business. From 1866 to 1868, he was president of the Atlantic and Pacific telegraph company, but the company failed. Afterward, he ran a prepatory school in New Castle, Kentucky until it burned in 1870. In the 1870s, he served in leadership positions at the University of Nashville, the Montgomery Bell Academy, and the University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee, where he was a professor of mathematics and botany.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P6'>Smith was married to Cassie (Selden) Smith. The pair had eleven children, including five sons and six daughters who lived to adulthood. Edmund Kirby Smith died on March 22, 1893 in Sewanee, Tennessee. He was buried in the University Cemetery at Sewanee, but he also has a cenotaph in the Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

<p corresp='TTP25063419P3' xml:id='OTP25063419P3'>I write to advise you that the raft is cut &amp; boats have passed through this morning to carry salt &amp; sugar and construct the new raft at <rs ref='#S25009203'>Haynes Bluff</rs>—There is plenty of timber in the <rs ref='#S78230'>Yazoo</rs> brought out of the <rs ref='#S25011055'>Sun Flower rivers</rs> to construct a new raft and Mr <rs ref='#S107438'>Weldon</rs> goes down to day to prosecute the work. But of what use will a raft be if not protected by a <rs ref='#S71946'>battery of guns</rs>?—and in a convesation yesterday with Genl <rs ref='#S25010344'> Smith</rs> of <rs ref='#S51788'>Vicksburg</rs>, he said that he had made requisitions for guns but could not get them—It is perfectly plain to all men that if the <rs ref='#S63134'>Yazoo</rs> is not defended that a large portion of the State will be devastated &amp; overrun by the <rs ref='#S71916'>enemy</rs> next winter &amp; spring destroying the property &amp; carrying off the <rs ref='#S63099'>slaves</rs>—

<p corresp='TTP25063420P2' xml:id='OTP25063420P2'>I would respectfully suggest that you send an agent on to <rs ref='#S63093'>Richmond</rs> without delay, showing the defenceless condition of the Yazoo valley and the necessity of sending guns forward at once—there is not a day to be lost and if the agent will accompany the guns he can soon have them transported to Vicksburg so that they can be placed in battery at Haynes Bluff to defend Vicksburgs right flank &amp; at the same time the Yazoo valley—

<p corresp='TTP25063420P3' xml:id='OTP25063420P3'>I need not urge upon you prompt action in procurement of guns as no one is better aware of the necessity of it than yourself and I hope you will be able to prevail upon those who have the power, to comply with the requests you may make—On this subject I would be pleased to hear from you and I will do anything in the premises to assist in defending the state.
