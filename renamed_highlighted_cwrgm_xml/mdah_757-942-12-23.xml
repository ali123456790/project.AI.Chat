                    <p xml:id='OTPS71503P0'>Francis Wilkinson Pickens was a politician and governor of South Carolina during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P1'>Born on April 7, 1805 (or 1897), in Togadoo, South Carolina, Pickens was the son of a former South Carolina governor and the grandson of American Revolutionary War hero General Andrew Pickens. He was well educated, attending Franklin College (part of modern-day University of Georgia) and South Carolina College before becoming a practicing attorney in 1829. Soon afterwards he became active in politics, serving in the South Carolina House of Representatives in the early 1830s. His term in state office came about during the Nullification Crisis, when notable South Carolina politicians, including one of Pickens’s distant cousins John C. Calhoun, threatened to nullify an unpopular federal tariff law that benefitted northern interests. The political debate was hotly debated within the United States and was one of the first efforts by a state to directly challenge federal authority in the United States. It sparked talk of secession within South Carolina. Pickens supported nullification, but the issue quieted down after several months due to compromise efforts by some in Congress, and since few other southern states had fully backed South Carolina’s threats of nullification and secession.  (President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently opposed South Carolina’s action, tempering many attitudes in the souths.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P2'>Pickens’s political career continued to grow in the 1830s. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from 1834 to 1843. He was offered to be Minister to England by President James K. Polk, and then later offered to be Minister to France by President James Buchanan. He turned both of those offers down, but did accept an appointment to be Minister to Russia in 1858. He spent two years in that country, becoming friends with Czar Alexander II.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P3'>In 1860, Pickens was elected governor of South Carolina. Almost immediately after he entered office, his state voted to separate from the Union due to Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. Pickens was less radical about secession than many of his fellow South Carolinians in 1860. He wished to avoid war, but was largely carried forward by events beyond his control. He complained to federal authorities about the occupation of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor by U.S. Army troops, and approved the use of force against a Union ship, the <hi rend='italic'>Star of the West</hi>, sent to provide supplies to Fort Sumter in January 1861. As tensions mounted over the stand off at Fort Sumter, Pickens felt tremendous pressure and authorized the overall bombardment of the fort by Confederate forces in April 1861. He remained governor until December 1862, and then returned to his home in Edgefield, South Carolina, for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P4'>After the Civil War ended, Pickens was elected to be a delegate to a state constitutional convention in September 1865. He introduced a resolution to repeal South Carolina’s 1860 ordinance of secession, a matter deemed necessary for the state to resume its normal political position within the Union. He reportedly encouraged his fellow South Carolinians to embrace peace after the Confederacy’s defeat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P5'>Pickens lost most of his personal wealth during the Civil War. He died on January 25, 1869. He was married three times. His first wife was Margaret Simkins. She passed away in 1842. He married Marion Antoinette Dearing in 1845, but she died in 1853. His third, and final, wife was Lucy Petway Holcombe, whom he married in 1858. He had at least eight children. Pickens is buried in Edgefield Village Cemetery in Edgefield, South Carolina.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25004269P0'>George Wythe Randolph was a Confederate general who served as the Secretary of War for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P1'>Born on March 10, 1818, at Monticello near Charlottesville, Virginia, Randolph was the grandson of former president Thomas Jefferson. He received a private education before attending school in Massachusetts and then Washington, D.C. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1831 and served until 1839, gaining experience at sea on vessels such as USS <hi rend='italic'>John Adams</hi> and USS <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>. While still in the Navy, Randolph began attending the University of Virginia and later studied law, becoming a practicing attorney in Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P2'>Following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Randolph was elected as a delegate to Virginia’s secession convention in early 1861. He spoke in favor of secession, but the convention ultimately rejected disunion during the first vote. Following Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion in the south, after Confederate troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, pro-secessionist sentiments grew in Virginia, and the convention passed a secessionist resolution. Randolph had been part of a Virginia militia artillery unit in the 1850s, nicknamed the “Richmond Howitzers.” Upon the state’s secession, the governor called the unit into state service, and Randolph was commissioned as a major. The unit manned artillery pieces in defensive locations along the James River and fired the first shot of the Civil War in Virginia on May 7, 1861, at a Union gunboat sailing up the river. In September 1861, Randolph was promoted to colonel in what was later renamed the First Regiment Virginia Artillery. On February 12, 1862, he was promoted again, this time to brigadier general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P3'>Only one month later, on March 18, 1862, Randolph was appointed Secretary of War of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. He served only eight months before resigning, in November 1862, due to health problems from tuberculosis that he contracted years before in the Navy. He recovered enough to take a seat as a Virginia state senator a few months later. However, Randolph sailed through the Union naval blockade in 1864 for medical treatment in Europe. He was still there when the war ended, and remained in Europe for another year afterward, finally taking the oath of allegiance to the United States in April 1866.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P4'>Randolph returned to Virginia, but died in April 1867 from complications of tuberculosis. He was married to Mary Elizabeth Adams, but had no children. Randolph is buried in the Monticello cemetery in Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005483P0'>A militia, or unit of “state troops,” is a military organization made up of civilians within a community who can be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25005483P1'>South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union in response to Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. In mid-December 1860, before the state formally adopted a secession ordinance, the South Carolina legislature passed an act empowering the governor to raise a militia force to defend the state from federal military action. South Carolina had a strong history and, on paper, militia force; the enthusiasm for secession combined with the governor’s request for soldiers resulted in thousands of men volunteering for service in local militia units. Many of these units traveled to Charleston in the spring of 1861 and participated in the attack on Fort Sumter, which formally began military hostilities between the Union and the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25005483P2'>Many South Carolina volunteer units transferred to Confederate service, which took them out of the state for up to three years of service. To maintain a functional body of militia for state defense, the South Carolina government began recruiting men in their late forties or older—above normal military service, or draft, age. These units followed the more traditional militia practice of temporary activation by governor’s order for immediate threats. Throughout the war, South Carolina militia or state troops participated in military defensive operations at Charleston, along the coast, and against William Tecumseh Sherman’s campaign through the South during the final months of the war.

Stauffer, <hi rend='italic'>South Carolina’s Antebellum Militia</hi>, 22-25; Justin Harwell, “The Governor’s Guards: Militia, Politics, Social Networking, and Manhood in Columbia, South Carolina, 1843-1874,” Master’s Thesis: University of South Carolina (2021), 55-61.)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865).
