                    <p xml:id='OTPS51698P0'>Thomas Jesse Wharton was attorney general of Mississippi during the Civil War and a circuit judge after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P1'>Born on May 18, 1817, in Nashville, Tennessee, Wharton was a good student and graduated from Nashville law school at the age of 19. He moved to Clinton, Mississippi, in 1836 to practice law, but returned to Tennessee the following year, where he married Mary Edgar. The couple had nine children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P2'>Around 1839 Wharton and his wife moved to Raymond, Mississippi. In 1856, he was appointed the state’s attorney general and his family moved to Jackson. He remained in that position for eight years, including during most of the Civil War. During the secession crisis of 1861, Wharton also served as a commissioner to Tennessee, tasked with encouraging his native state to secede and join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P3'>After the Civil War, Wharton returned to law practice. In 1882, after Reconstruction, he was selected judge of the Seventh Judicial District. He held that position until 1886. Wharton died on January 28, 1900. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS107770P0'>William Nelson Rector Beall was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS107770P1'>Born on March 20, 1825, in Bardstown, Kentucky, Beall moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, as a child with his family. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1848, and served as an officer in various infantry and cavalry units in the U.S. territories through the 1850s. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Beall resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. He initially served as a cavalry captain, but was repeatedly promoted until becoming a brigadier general in 1862 under General Earl Van Dorn in the Trans-Mississippi theater. After commanding cavalry forces at Corinth, Mississippi, Beall was then transferred to Port Hudson, Louisiana, where he was captured by Union forces in July 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS107770P2'>While imprisoned at Johnson’s Island in Ohio, Beall advocated for better treatment Confederate prisoners held by Union. Through an arrangement with federal officials, he was paroled in December 1864 and made an agent to oversee the sale of Confederate cotton in the northern states and Europe, with the profits being used to purchase supplies for Confederate prisoners. The terms of his parole required that he not aid the Confederacy or escape back to Confederate lines. With this agreement, Beall opened an office in New York City to facilitate the sale of southern cotton and the purchase and transfer of goods to Confederate prisoners held in northern camps. Shortly afterwards, in January 1865, Beall was arrested and placed in Fort Lafayette in New York due to the controversy of a Confederate general openly engaging in business in New York and from accusations that he was intentionally defrauding the United States government. However, when the promised cotton shipment arrived, federal authorities released Beall from his detention and he continued his prisoner relief efforts for the next several months.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS107770P3'>In August 1865, after the war, Beall moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and worked as a general commission merchant for several years. He died on July 26, 1883, in Tennessee. He was married to Felicia Bass and had four children. He is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS97207P0'>John C. Pemberton was a Confederate general, most famous for commanding troops in the unsuccessful defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P1'>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 10, 1814, Pemberton was raised and educated in the north. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837, and immediately afterwards served as a U.S. artillery officer in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He remained a professional soldier for the next two decades, serving at various forts and posts in the United States, along the Canadian border, and in the west. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Pemberton served with the 4th U.S. Artillery and took part in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de La Palma, and Monterrey. He earned the brevet (honorary) rank of captain for his actions at Monterrey. He continued to serve with distinction at several other engagements in Mexico, including the storming of Chapultepec castle and the battle at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P2'>In 1848, following the Mexican-American War, Pemberton married Martha Thompson of Virginia. The couple had one daughter and three sons, all born in the 1850s. Pemberton continued to serve at a variety of posts in the United States, and saw additional action in Florida against the Seminoles from 1849 to 1850, and then again from 1856 to 1857. After spending a year in New Mexico Territory and three years in Minnesota, Pemberton was sent to Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1861, in the midst of the secession crisis. Despite his northern upbringing, Pemberton resigned his commission from the United States Army when the Civil War erupted in April 1861. He immediately volunteered for Confederate service and received an appointment as assistant adjutant general of Confederate forces at Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P3'>Because of his lengthy military experience, Pemberton rose quickly in Confederate ranks, reaching major general in January 1862. He was placed in command of the military department defending Georgia and South Carolina, but soon ran into conflict with the states’ governors who objected to Pemberton's assertion that the survival of his army was more important than defending the region, and due to mistrust of his northern heritage. Confederate President Jefferson Davis placed the more popular General P. G. T. Beauregard in charge of the defense of Georgia and South Carolina and relocated Pemberton to a new military department in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P4'>At his new assignment in Mississippi, in the fall of 1862, Pemberton received the promotion to lieutenant general. He was responsible for defending the Mississippi River and key port towns, such as Vicksburg, from federal attack. Unlike the more famous Confederate armies to the east, Pemberton’s command was made up of southern troops who had suffered several defeats against aggressive Union commanders at battles like Shiloh and Corinth. Many of Pemberton’s troops were separated, and he struggled to unite his force to stage an effective defense against Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army, which began a campaign for Vicksburg in December 1862. Making matters worse for the Confederate general, his orders were to hold Vicksburg at all cost—meaning that he had limited ability to maneuver or even withdraw to save his army in the face of Grant’s larger force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P5'>Between December 1862 and July 1863, Grant conducted a slow, creative, but ultimately persistent campaign to surround and capture Vicksburg. Utilizing his aggressive subordinate William T. Sherman, Grant cut Pemberton and his Confederate troops off at Vicksburg and burned Mississippi’s capital of Jackson in May 1863. After being besieged in Vicksburg by Grant’s troops for six weeks, Pemberton realized he had no other choice but to surrender. On July 4, 1863, Pemberton ordered his army to lay down its arms and open Vicksburg to Grant’s army. The defeat occurred one day after Robert E. Lee’s battlefield loss at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, delivering a double blow to Confederate morale.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P6'>Pemberton and his men were captured and paroled by Union forces—a practice by which prisoners were allowed to return home or to encampments under the sworn oath not to take up arms until formally exchanged for Union prisoners. Pemberton traveled to Richmond where he remained idle for several months. Not receiving a new assignment, he resigned his general’s commission in May 1864. President Davis offered him a conciliatory assignment as a lieutenant colonel of artillery, which he accepted. He temporarily commanded the artillery defense of Richmond before taking an appointment as inspector general of artillery. Pemberton was captured by Union troops in mid-April 1865 during the final days of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P7'>Following the Civil War, Pemberton moved to Warrenton, Virginia. He remained there until 1876, when he moved back to Pennsylvania. He lived quietly on a farm, passing away in 1881. Pemberton is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the first military drafts occurred during the American Civil War, in which both the Union and Confederate governments issued conscription laws.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P1'>The Confederacy, receiving fewer enlistments than it expected at the beginning of the war, passed the First Conscription Act in April 1862, rendering all able-bodied white males between the ages of 18 and 35 eligible to be compelled into military service, but it included a provision by which a draftee could hire a substitute or obtain an exemption. Fearing insurrections by the enslaved population, the Confederacy passed a Second Conscription Act in September 1862 exempting one white enslaver for every twenty enslaved persons on a property, also known as the "Twenty Slave Law". Both the substitute and twenty slave laws isolated impoverished white southerners and rendered the draft deeply unpopular among non-elite southerners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P2'>In the North, conscription began in July 1862 when Congress authorized the president to enlist any militia company into the United States' service. Conscription extended to the general public in March 1863 with the Enrollment Act, rendering any able-bodied white male citizen or immigrant between the ages of 20 and 45 subject to the draft. This law similarly included a provision allowing one to purchase a substitute or commutation for the then-sizeable fee of $300. Draftees could also be exempt by proving that they were the sole support of family members or other dependents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P3'>Many individuals in the North and South saw their respective drafts as affronts to the freedom and individual liberties upon which the United States was founded, while tensions also arose between those of different races, ethnicities, religions, and social classes that were differently represented in the draft. The draft also brought home the realities of war to many families, North and South, who relied on men to support them, as fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers were sent to fight, where they would make the little money paid to soldiers and possibly lose their lives. Conscription in the American Civil War led to the violence of the New York Draft Riots of July 1863, and resulted in widespread and varied resistance in North and South (Bill of Rights Institute).

<p corresp='TTP1816027P2' xml:id='OTP1816027P2'>Dear Sir:
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1816027P3' xml:id='OTP1816027P3'>If my friends in <rs ref='#S63250'>Claiborne County</rs> still desire that I should return home and resume the practice of my profession, they can probably assist me to do so, by a comparatively easy method. Though Maj. <rs ref='#S104421'>McLaurin</rs>, Commanding this <rs ref='#S70882'>Batallion</rs>, I have obtained the promise of Gen<add place='above'>l</add>. <rs ref='#S107770'>Beall</rs>, that, if I shall make applica-tion to him in due form, he will accept my resignation of my position as <rs ref='#S25013612'>Commissary</rs> and will grant me a <rs ref='#S77079'>discharge</rs> from the Service. Gen<add place='above'>l</add>. <rs ref='#S97207'>Pemberton</rs> will, I suppose, approve of Gen<add place='above'>l</add>. Beall's act: to him the matter will be finally referred.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1816027P4' xml:id='OTP1816027P4'>I have heard so much about the rigid exaction of the Militia laws in the State of Mississippi, and have learned that in Claiborne Co. all men under 50 years of age are pressed into <rs ref='#S63200'>militia service</rs> if hands can be laid upon them, that I am not disposed to relinquish my present position in favor of the State Service, if the latter must be the alternative. In my own mind the case is clear; I do not think I would be truly liable to state service, were I to resign and obtain a discharge here; my status has been fixed as a confederate soldier, and the state of Mississippi has not been able to claim me as a milita-man; my discharge here <hi rend='underline'>would not</hi> be based upon the Confederate "Exemption" act, but would be equivalent to a furlough of duration commensurate with the time specified in the oath by which I was sworn into the Confederate Service,—three year or ^during^ the War.

          <p corresp='TTP1816028P0' xml:id='OTP1816028P0'>The recently published opinion of Attorney General <rs ref='#S51698'>Wharton</rs>, sets forth, I understand, that the State of Miss<add place='above'>i</add>. is entitled to the services, in the militia, of the <hi rend='underline'>exempts</hi> under the law of the <rs ref='#S54079'>Confederate Congress</rs>: this does not cover my case, which is proposed to be one of clear discharge. If the state of Mississippi intends to make use of all <rs ref='#S25004889'><hi rend='underline'>conscripts</hi></rs>—persons between 18 &amp; 45 years of age, until the Confederacy shall demand them; still I shall not belong to this category, for the reason that I fixed my status as a volunteer some time before the last conscript law was passed, and if discharged would not be liable to be remanded to the confederate service. If the military laws of the Confederate States have been intended to exercise control over all persons between 18 &amp; 45 years of age,—excepting, perhaps, such as had, previously, been drafted into state service,—I am clearly, and must continue to be, subject to Confederare laws, those laws, in their exercise, either retaining me where I now am, or discharging me, by special act of my Commanding General, from the performance of my duties.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP1816028P1' xml:id='OTP1816028P1'>Nevertheless, it might be the surest course for my friends to obtain for me, from Gov Pettus, a <del rend='overstrike'>written</del> paper setting forth my exemption from Militia Service, in case I should be discharged from the Confederate Army. If you could and will procure such a paper from the Governor, I shall be under much obligation to you, and will endeavor to return to Claiborne Co, and make myself as useful to my friends as possible. Please do this with as little delay as possible, and telegraph me.
