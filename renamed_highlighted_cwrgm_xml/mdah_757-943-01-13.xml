                    <p xml:id='OTPS75312P0'>Walter Goodman was a banker, railroad developer, and executive of the Mississippi Central Railroad in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75312P1'>Born on April 16, 1803, in New York City, New York, Goodman moved to Mississippi as a young man and entered the banking profession. He developed a reputation for integrity and good financial management, and was later employed by the American Land Company to manage the company’s holdings in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75312P2'>During the mid-nineteenth century, Goodman became interested in railroad development and in the early 1850s undertook an effort to establish a rail line to connect cotton planters and farmers in Mississippi and Tennessee to northern rail lines and railroad companies operating along the Gulf Coast. The project was named the Mississippi Central Railroad and was incorporated by the Mississippi government in 1852. Goodman was appointed president and he oversaw its construction during the 1850s, acquiring financing and even traveling to England to secure sufficient iron for construction. In 1860, the line was complete, becoming part of a rail line that connected the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes. Goodman continued to manage the railroad during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75312P3'>Shortly after the war, Goodman left the railroad company and went into business in New York with his brother-in-law, Dr. A. F. Merrill. Then, on April 16, 1866, Goodman died of liver failure at Merrill’s home in New York. He was married to Anna Merrill and had at least one child that survived to adulthood.  Goodman is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63513P0'>Christopher Gustavus Memminger was an author of the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States of America and the first Secretary of the Treasury for the Confederacy. Born on January 9, 1803, in Vaihingen, Wuerttemberg (modern-day Stuttgart, Germany), Memminger moved to Charleston, South Carolina, as a small child with his mother after his father passed away. He was orphaned in 1807 when his mother died of yellow fever, but at the age of eleven was taken in by Thomas Bennett, future governor of South Carolina. At age twelve, Memminger entered South Carolina College and graduated at the age of sixteen. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in 1825. Memminger became involved in the 1830s, winning an election to the South Carolina state legislature in 1836 and served almost continuously until 1860. He chaired the legislature’s finance committee for most of his time in office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P1'>Memminger was considered a moderate among southerners during the growing sectional crisis. He opposed South Carolina’s proponents of nullification (the theory that a state could reject a federal law it opposed) and was hesitant to support calls for secession during the 1850s. However, after Abraham Lincoln was elected president on an anti-slavery Republican platform in 1860, Memminger became an advocate for disunion and wrote the proclamation outlining South Carolina’s secession from the Union, entitled <hi rend='italic'>Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union</hi>.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P2'>Memminger was elected to represent South Carolina in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He chaired the committee that drafted a constitution for the Confederacy in four days, and then received an appointment as Secretary of the Treasury in February 1861. In that role he struggled to finance the Confederate war effort, resorting to supporting income taxes, widespread issuing of paper money, and even confiscating gold from the U.S. Mint in New Orleans. Memminger served as Treasury secretary until July 1864, then resigned and retired to his summer home in North Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P3'>After the Civil War, Memminger returned to Charleston, South Carolina, and operated a law practice. He also returned to the state legislature, dedicating much of his time to improving South Carolina’s public education system. He died on March 7, 1888, in Charleston. Memminger was married to Mary Wilkinson and had seventeen children (only eight survived to adulthood). After Mary passed away in 1874, Memminger married her sister Sarah Ann. Memminger is buried in Saint John in the Wilderness Cemetery in Flat Rock, North Carolina.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25006250P0'>Alexander Mosby Clayton was a judge and political figure in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006250P1'>Born on January 15, 1801, in Campbell County, Virginia, Clayton studied law and became a practicing attorney in that state in 1823. He moved to Arkansas Territory in 1832 to accept an appointment from President Andrew Jackson as a judge in the territory’s superior court. Five years later, he relocated to Mississippi. Clayton was elected to Mississippi’s High Court of Errors and Appeals (the precursor to the state’s Supreme Court) in 1842 and served until 1852. During that same period in Mississippi, Clayton was appointed the first president of the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees, and served in that role until 1852. In 1853, Clayton received an appointment from President Franklin Pierce to be consul in Havana, Cuba. He served one year in that role, and then returned to Mississippi to practice law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006250P2'>During the 1850s, Clayton became an outspoken proponent of secession in response to northern anti-slavery activities. He was a delegate to the Nashville Convention, a meeting of southern delegates to debate the political dispute over slavery in territories gained from the Mexican-American War, and promoted a hardline stance, including disunion, to protect slaveholding interests. Ten years later, in January 1861, at Mississippi's secession convention in the wake of Abraham Lincoln’s election to the president, Clayton again advocated secession, and wrote the state’s declaration of reasons for separating from the Union. He was then selected to represent the state in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States during the spring of 1861. Following his short time in the Confederate Congress, Clayton served as a Confederate district court judge during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006250P3'>A year after the war ended, Clayton received an appointment as a circuit judge in Mississippi. He held that position for three years before being removed by federal officials in 1869, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and its provision that prohibited previous U.S. officials who had supported the Confederacy from holding military or civil office. He returned to private law practice, as well as worked as director of the Mississippi Central Railroad.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006250P4'>Clayton died on September 30, 1889. He was married to Barbara Barker and had at least two children who survived to adulthood. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

<p corresp='TTP25195197P5' xml:id='OTP25195197P5'>I hope you will pardon me for calling your attention again, to the subject of the de=posite made by me to your credit as Secty of the <rs ref='#S62997'>Treasury</rs> in the month of November of last year, in the <rs ref='#S32123706'>Bank of La</rs>" <rs ref='#S63017'>N, O,</rs>—Mr <rs ref='#S25024479'>Clapp</rs> my <rs ref='#S63936'>representative</rs> in <rs ref='#S54079'>Congress</rs> wrote me under date of 9<add place='above'>th</add> Sep", that you declined to issue bonds for the deposite, "because the funds were placed in Bank, which was not a depository of the Government—and they were placed to the credit of M<add place='above'>r</add> Memminger, and not of the Treasurer"
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25195197P6' xml:id='OTP25195197P6'>When notified of the deposite, if it had been refused, because not made with a depository of the Government, I should immediately have transferred the funds to any place, which might have been directed—But in a letter of Dec<add place='above'>r</add> 19—1861, Mr <rs ref='#S72129'>Elmore</rs> says, my letter in regard to $ 19.436 80/100 in the Bank of Louisiana have been received and referred to him, and that the bonds could not be issued, unless the particular cases were stated in which the money was deposited" no objection was made to the <hi rend='underline'>place</hi> of deposite—On the 8<add place='above'>th</add> of January of this year

          <p corresp='TTP25195198P0' xml:id='OTP25195198P0'>I replied to the letter of Mr Elmore, and enclosed him the name and style of the case, in which the money was deposited, and enclosed likewise a Copy of the Order of <rs ref='#S63395'>Court</rs>, under which it was made, I requested in that letter, that the bonds should be delivered to Mr <rs ref='#S75312'>Goodman</rs> Pres<add place='above'>t</add> of the <rs ref='#S63142'>Mi Cen Road</rs>, who was then in <rs ref='#S63093'>Richmond</rs>—On his return to <rs ref='#S63000'>Holey Springs</rs>,  Mr Goodman reported to me, that Mr Elmore said, he was then too much occupied to have the bonds prepared, but they should be executed and sent to me in a short time—At a later day, I requested Mr Clapp to see you, He did so, and stated that he could not get the bonds, But did not intimate, that there was any doubt in the Department, as to its liability to make the issue, Nor was any intimation ever received, that the Bond would not be forthcoming, until Mr Clapps letter of Sept 9<add place='above'>th</add> before referred to—as to the other objection, that the funds were placed to the credit of Mr Memminger, I think it is without just foundation—The Deposite was to the credit of C G Memminger Esq Secty of the Treasury C, S, A, and the law itself in terms requires, that the payment should be to "the Secretary of the Treasury" not the Treasurer, Third Sess; acts page 5<add place='above'>th</add> N<add place='above'>o</add> 197, It was thus in strict compliance with the law, I enclose a Copy of the letter of the Cashier of the Bank of date 27<add place='above'>th</add> Nov 1861—in which he says, "he has advised you of the deposite on that day" I never heard of any

I supplied the only defect, which according to Mr Elmores letter, stood in the way of issuing the bonds—Now when the money was permitted to lie there, "to the credit of the Secretary of the Treasury" for five months after notice to you of the Deposite, and for five months before the fall of New Orleans, without objection to the place or the manner of the deposite, and when the only objection to the issuance of the Bonds was placed, on an entirely different ground, I submit with entire defference, that the Government is now precluded from refusing to issue them, I must therefore respectfully ask you to review your conclusion—It is a case certainly in which there has been no neglect, on the part of the Court— The Department was promptly notified of all that had been done. The only objection raised by the Treasurer, was removed at once, The money was beyond the reach of the Court, and stood to the credit of the Secty of the Treasury "If he permitted it to be in the Bank, until it fell into the hands of the enemy, it was no fault of the court, He sanctered
