                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25004269P0'>George Wythe Randolph was a Confederate general who served as the Secretary of War for the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P1'>Born on March 10, 1818, at Monticello near Charlottesville, Virginia, Randolph was the grandson of former president Thomas Jefferson. He received a private education before attending school in Massachusetts and then Washington, D.C. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1831 and served until 1839, gaining experience at sea on vessels such as USS <hi rend='italic'>John Adams</hi> and USS <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>. While still in the Navy, Randolph began attending the University of Virginia and later studied law, becoming a practicing attorney in Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P2'>Following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Randolph was elected as a delegate to Virginia’s secession convention in early 1861. He spoke in favor of secession, but the convention ultimately rejected disunion during the first vote. Following Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion in the south, after Confederate troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, pro-secessionist sentiments grew in Virginia, and the convention passed a secessionist resolution. Randolph had been part of a Virginia militia artillery unit in the 1850s, nicknamed the “Richmond Howitzers.” Upon the state’s secession, the governor called the unit into state service, and Randolph was commissioned as a major. The unit manned artillery pieces in defensive locations along the James River and fired the first shot of the Civil War in Virginia on May 7, 1861, at a Union gunboat sailing up the river. In September 1861, Randolph was promoted to colonel in what was later renamed the First Regiment Virginia Artillery. On February 12, 1862, he was promoted again, this time to brigadier general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P3'>Only one month later, on March 18, 1862, Randolph was appointed Secretary of War of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. He served only eight months before resigning, in November 1862, due to health problems from tuberculosis that he contracted years before in the Navy. He recovered enough to take a seat as a Virginia state senator a few months later. However, Randolph sailed through the Union naval blockade in 1864 for medical treatment in Europe. He was still there when the war ended, and remained in Europe for another year afterward, finally taking the oath of allegiance to the United States in April 1866.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004269P4'>Randolph returned to Virginia, but died in April 1867 from complications of tuberculosis. He was married to Mary Elizabeth Adams, but had no children. Randolph is buried in the Monticello cemetery in Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71503P0'>Francis Wilkinson Pickens was a politician and governor of South Carolina during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P1'>Born on April 7, 1805 (or 1897), in Togadoo, South Carolina, Pickens was the son of a former South Carolina governor and the grandson of American Revolutionary War hero General Andrew Pickens. He was well educated, attending Franklin College (part of modern-day University of Georgia) and South Carolina College before becoming a practicing attorney in 1829. Soon afterwards he became active in politics, serving in the South Carolina House of Representatives in the early 1830s. His term in state office came about during the Nullification Crisis, when notable South Carolina politicians, including one of Pickens’s distant cousins John C. Calhoun, threatened to nullify an unpopular federal tariff law that benefitted northern interests. The political debate was hotly debated within the United States and was one of the first efforts by a state to directly challenge federal authority in the United States. It sparked talk of secession within South Carolina. Pickens supported nullification, but the issue quieted down after several months due to compromise efforts by some in Congress, and since few other southern states had fully backed South Carolina’s threats of nullification and secession.  (President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently opposed South Carolina’s action, tempering many attitudes in the souths.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P2'>Pickens’s political career continued to grow in the 1830s. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from 1834 to 1843. He was offered to be Minister to England by President James K. Polk, and then later offered to be Minister to France by President James Buchanan. He turned both of those offers down, but did accept an appointment to be Minister to Russia in 1858. He spent two years in that country, becoming friends with Czar Alexander II.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P3'>In 1860, Pickens was elected governor of South Carolina. Almost immediately after he entered office, his state voted to separate from the Union due to Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. Pickens was less radical about secession than many of his fellow South Carolinians in 1860. He wished to avoid war, but was largely carried forward by events beyond his control. He complained to federal authorities about the occupation of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor by U.S. Army troops, and approved the use of force against a Union ship, the <hi rend='italic'>Star of the West</hi>, sent to provide supplies to Fort Sumter in January 1861. As tensions mounted over the stand off at Fort Sumter, Pickens felt tremendous pressure and authorized the overall bombardment of the fort by Confederate forces in April 1861. He remained governor until December 1862, and then returned to his home in Edgefield, South Carolina, for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P4'>After the Civil War ended, Pickens was elected to be a delegate to a state constitutional convention in September 1865. He introduced a resolution to repeal South Carolina’s 1860 ordinance of secession, a matter deemed necessary for the state to resume its normal political position within the Union. He reportedly encouraged his fellow South Carolinians to embrace peace after the Confederacy’s defeat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71503P5'>Pickens lost most of his personal wealth during the Civil War. He died on January 25, 1869. He was married three times. His first wife was Margaret Simkins. She passed away in 1842. He married Marion Antoinette Dearing in 1845, but she died in 1853. His third, and final, wife was Lucy Petway Holcombe, whom he married in 1858. He had at least eight children. Pickens is buried in Edgefield Village Cemetery in Edgefield, South Carolina.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P0'>During the American Civil War, to disband a military unit was to formally dissolve it. Once dissolved, soldiers returned to their state capitals to deposit their weapons and other publicly owned property. Units were disbanded for a number of reasons throughout the war, including the end of their service agreement and surrender. Frequently, officers disbanded a unit with diminished strength and reorganized it to form a full strength unit. As the Lieber Code did not recognize un-uniformed guerrilla fighters, it was also common for leaders of guerrilla units, like Confederate Col. John Singleton Mosby, to disband their command rather than formally surrender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P1'>Following Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in April 1864, the enormous process of demobilizing all Confederate armies began. The terms for disbanding Confederate military units Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant offered Lee were mimicked by other Union commanders. Rather that disbanding the men without any restraints, Grant classified them as paroled prisoners of war, which would legally forbid them for taking up arms against the United States again.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99666P0'>In warfare, an army moving into an enemy’s home territory is often described as an invasion. During the American Civil War, most examples of military forces moving into enemy territory involved Union armies advancing into Confederate states. Some of these incursions were temporary, such as small cavalry raids to destroy Confederate supplies and even larger campaigns behind Confederate lines to harm Southern infrastructure (such as William T. Sherman’s “March Through Georgia”). However, Union victory in the Civil War depended upon the United States Army conducting offensive operations and occupying large portions of the South. These efforts split apart the Confederacy, placed secessionist communities back under federal control, and reduced the Confederate armies’ ability to wage war. Pro-secessionist Southerners considered these efforts to be federal invasions, and described communities captured by Union armies as being overrun. However, pro-Union Southerners cheered the arrival of Union soldiers, considering them liberators rather than invaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99666P1'>Although the Confederacy fought a defensive war, Southern military forces occasionally conducted incursions into northern communities. Robert E. Lee’s Maryland Campaign in 1862 (which culminated in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862) was seen by many Marylanders as an invasion of their state. His second offensive campaign into the North, in the summer of 1863, was widely reported in the Northern press as a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. That campaign ultimately resulted in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P0'>By 1862 the initial waves of men who enlisted into Confederate military service diminished as enthusiasm for the war diminished, and both the Union and Confederacy enacted drafts to fill their armies. Nearly one year before the Union (March 1863), the Confederacy instituted a national draft in April 1862. There were important social implications to this policy, especially within the exemptions the Union and Confederacy provided. Similar to the Union, the Confederate act allowed drafted men to hire substitutes to serve in their place (often lower-class men willing to serve for much-needed income) and excused men from military service for medical reasons, "workers deemed necessary to maintain society," including select government employees. And unlike the Union, beginning in October 1862, men who enslaved a minimum of twenty (later fifteen) people were exempt.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P1'>The Twenty-Slave Law exemption was a reaction to President Abraham Lincoln's recent announcement of the<lb/>
Emancipation Proclamation. While many southern whites worried about enslaved people uprising with so many white men away at war, these policies cultivated a feeling among impoverished people that they were doing the majority of fighting and suffering for a “rich man's war.” Scholars like Joseph Glathaar proved this was not the case in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia where the wealthy were overrepresented compared with impoverished soldiers, but it is unclear if this was the case in areas like Mississippi, and the perception of unfair protections for the wealthy fueled resentment.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the first military drafts occurred during the American Civil War, in which both the Union and Confederate governments issued conscription laws.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P1'>The Confederacy, receiving fewer enlistments than it expected at the beginning of the war, passed the First Conscription Act in April 1862, rendering all able-bodied white males between the ages of 18 and 35 eligible to be compelled into military service, but it included a provision by which a draftee could hire a substitute or obtain an exemption. Fearing insurrections by the enslaved population, the Confederacy passed a Second Conscription Act in September 1862 exempting one white enslaver for every twenty enslaved persons on a property, also known as the "Twenty Slave Law". Both the substitute and twenty slave laws isolated impoverished white southerners and rendered the draft deeply unpopular among non-elite southerners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P2'>In the North, conscription began in July 1862 when Congress authorized the president to enlist any militia company into the United States' service. Conscription extended to the general public in March 1863 with the Enrollment Act, rendering any able-bodied white male citizen or immigrant between the ages of 20 and 45 subject to the draft. This law similarly included a provision allowing one to purchase a substitute or commutation for the then-sizeable fee of $300. Draftees could also be exempt by proving that they were the sole support of family members or other dependents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P3'>Many individuals in the North and South saw their respective drafts as affronts to the freedom and individual liberties upon which the United States was founded, while tensions also arose between those of different races, ethnicities, religions, and social classes that were differently represented in the draft. The draft also brought home the realities of war to many families, North and South, who relied on men to support them, as fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers were sent to fight, where they would make the little money paid to soldiers and possibly lose their lives. Conscription in the American Civil War led to the violence of the New York Draft Riots of July 1863, and resulted in widespread and varied resistance in North and South (Bill of Rights Institute).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
