                    <p xml:id='OTPS94238P0'>Eugene Woldemar Hilgard was a chemist and geologist and is often credited as the “father of soil science” in the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94238P1'>Born in Zweibruecken, Bavaria, on January 5, 1833, Hilgard moved with his family to the United States in 1835. His family settled in Illinois, but Hilgard suffered from poor health—in part due to malaria—and later traveled to Washington, D.C. with is brother in pursuit of a healthier climate. Once there, he met several leading scientists and began pursuing a formal education in chemistry. During a visit to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hilgard was encouraged to return to Europe to study analytical chemistry. In 1849, he traveled to Heidelberg to meet one of his brothers studying medicine there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94238P2'>Hilgard studied in Germany and Switzerland, eventually receiving a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1853 at Heidelberg. He spent two years in Spain and Portugal, then returned to the United States and received a position as the assistant state geologist of Mississippi in 1855. He served in that position for two years before spending one year in Washington, D.C., as head of the Smithsonian Institution’s laboratory and lecturing on chemistry at the National Medical College in Washington, D.C. In 1858 he became the state geologist for Mississippi and a professor of chemistry at the University of Mississippi. He remained on the university campus during the Civil War, overseeing the use of some campus buildings as hospitals for wounded Union and Confederate soldiers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94238P3'>Hilgard remained Mississippi’s state geologist until 1873, when he moved to Michigan to take a position as professor of mineralogy, geology, zoology, and botany. Two years later, he moved again, this time to California, where he became professor of agricultural chemistry at the University of California, Berkley. He remained in that position from 1875 to 1904. In California, Hilgard oversaw the state’s agricultural experiment station and conducted numerous soil studies. His publications in Mississippi and California established him as a leading expert in soil sciences.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94238P4'>Hilgard died on January 8, 1916. He had been married to Jesusa Alexandrina Bello—the daughter of a Spanish Army officer, who Hilgard had met in Spain during his European studies as a young man. The couple had four children. Hilgard is buried in St. Mary’s Cemetery in Oakland, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P0'>By 1862 the initial waves of men who enlisted into Confederate military service diminished as enthusiasm for the war diminished, and both the Union and Confederacy enacted drafts to fill their armies. Nearly one year before the Union (March 1863), the Confederacy instituted a national draft in April 1862. There were important social implications to this policy, especially within the exemptions the Union and Confederacy provided. Similar to the Union, the Confederate act allowed drafted men to hire substitutes to serve in their place (often lower-class men willing to serve for much-needed income) and excused men from military service for medical reasons, "workers deemed necessary to maintain society," including select government employees. And unlike the Union, beginning in October 1862, men who enslaved a minimum of twenty (later fifteen) people were exempt.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P1'>The Twenty-Slave Law exemption was a reaction to President Abraham Lincoln's recent announcement of the<lb/>
Emancipation Proclamation. While many southern whites worried about enslaved people uprising with so many white men away at war, these policies cultivated a feeling among impoverished people that they were doing the majority of fighting and suffering for a “rich man's war.” Scholars like Joseph Glathaar proved this was not the case in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia where the wealthy were overrepresented compared with impoverished soldiers, but it is unclear if this was the case in areas like Mississippi, and the perception of unfair protections for the wealthy fueled resentment.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25012877P0'>Established in April 1862, the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau was an office within the Confederate War Department responsible for acquiring natural metals and minerals for the production of military weapons and ammunition. While the bureau sought to acquire copper, lead, iron, coal, and zinc, the production of nitre proved to be among its most important responsibility. Nitre, also known as saltpeter, was a crucial ingredient in gunpowder. Since the Union blockade severely restricted southern imports of gunpowder and its ingredients, the bureau oversaw the collection and refinement of nitre from various sources, including limestone caves, barn dirt (soil below smoke houses and barns which contained nitre produced from the combination of animal waste, ash, and lime), and night soil (human waste collections). These efforts helped sustain the Confederate supply of gunpowder during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012877P1'>The Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau also operated lead, silver, and zinc mines in various parts of the south. The bureau also worked with civilian companies and contractors to acquire necessary iron, lead, and zinc supplies. Ss the war progressed and Union armies overran parts of the Confederacy, the bureau had to shut down mining operations and seek new sources for the minerals. Additionally, the collapse of the Confederate infrastructure due to federal military campaigns and internal strife reduced the bureau’s ability to conduct mining operations, transport supplies across the south, and even pay for mining services. Bureau agents continued to seek mineral supplies for the Confederacy until the end of the war. (Glenna R. Schroeder, “‘We Will Support the Govt. to the Bitter End’: The August Office of the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau,” <hi rend='italic'>The Georgia Historical Quarterly</hi>, 288–305; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

<p corresp='TTP25093346P4' xml:id='OTP25093346P4'>I was yesterday stopped by an <rs ref='#S50347'>en-rolling officer</rs>, who, notwithstanding that I am clearly <rs ref='#S25009736'>exempt</rs> by law, insists that I must go to <rs ref='#S51726'>Brookhaven</rs> for a final certificate. What law there is for this, I cannot understand. Besides being a State officer, assigned to a special duty during the war by the act of Aug. 7, 1861, I bear a <rs ref='#S63938'>com-mission</rs> in the <rs ref='#S25012877'>Nitre Bureau</rs>, for which I have been making examinations, more or less, all the time. Above all, I am utter-ly unable to perform any service in the field—I have been an <rs ref='#S73740'>invalid</rs> more or less for twelve years, and worse than ever during the past year. I cannot possibly in any capacity serve the state as well as by the examinations of salts, brines, coppers &amp; other ores, with which I have been constantly pressed for months past, and am now; and I flatter myself have done service to the public. Still, I would rather go and settle the matter at once, but for the unfortunate juncture at which it is imposed upon me. If I leave now, I may be ab-sent just when most needed to perform the duties imposed upon me by the <rs ref='#S54079'>legislature</rs>, viz to "preserve the collections". I am the only one who could intelligently effect any ne-cessary removal either of the survey or <rs ref='#S62970'>University</rs> collec-tions; <rs ref='#S63003'>Prof.</rs> <rs ref='#S25006578'>Quinche</rs>, with the best will, is unable to do this and relies on me for it. I should not, I think, be performing my duty to the State, were I to leave under such circumstances. The officer has given me time till Mon-

I intended to leave to-night, but the train is reserved for the <rs ref='#S69274'>sick</rs>, and hence I write, for it seems so absurd that I should be compelled to perform such a unnecessary trip just at such a critical period, when I may say without boasting, the preservation of the most valuable part of the collections here may depend upon my presence, simply because I am professionally in-telligent on the matter.
