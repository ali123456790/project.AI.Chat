                    <p xml:id='OTPS63513P0'>Christopher Gustavus Memminger was an author of the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States of America and the first Secretary of the Treasury for the Confederacy. Born on January 9, 1803, in Vaihingen, Wuerttemberg (modern-day Stuttgart, Germany), Memminger moved to Charleston, South Carolina, as a small child with his mother after his father passed away. He was orphaned in 1807 when his mother died of yellow fever, but at the age of eleven was taken in by Thomas Bennett, future governor of South Carolina. At age twelve, Memminger entered South Carolina College and graduated at the age of sixteen. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in 1825. Memminger became involved in the 1830s, winning an election to the South Carolina state legislature in 1836 and served almost continuously until 1860. He chaired the legislature’s finance committee for most of his time in office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P1'>Memminger was considered a moderate among southerners during the growing sectional crisis. He opposed South Carolina’s proponents of nullification (the theory that a state could reject a federal law it opposed) and was hesitant to support calls for secession during the 1850s. However, after Abraham Lincoln was elected president on an anti-slavery Republican platform in 1860, Memminger became an advocate for disunion and wrote the proclamation outlining South Carolina’s secession from the Union, entitled <hi rend='italic'>Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union</hi>.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P2'>Memminger was elected to represent South Carolina in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He chaired the committee that drafted a constitution for the Confederacy in four days, and then received an appointment as Secretary of the Treasury in February 1861. In that role he struggled to finance the Confederate war effort, resorting to supporting income taxes, widespread issuing of paper money, and even confiscating gold from the U.S. Mint in New Orleans. Memminger served as Treasury secretary until July 1864, then resigned and retired to his summer home in North Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P3'>After the Civil War, Memminger returned to Charleston, South Carolina, and operated a law practice. He also returned to the state legislature, dedicating much of his time to improving South Carolina’s public education system. He died on March 7, 1888, in Charleston. Memminger was married to Mary Wilkinson and had seventeen children (only eight survived to adulthood). After Mary passed away in 1874, Memminger married her sister Sarah Ann. Memminger is buried in Saint John in the Wilderness Cemetery in Flat Rock, North Carolina.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25008803P0'>During the Civil War, the Confederate government sought ways to finance its military expenditures. Due to strong states’ rights sentiments within the South, the Confederacy’s central government was much weaker than the United States federal government in Washington, D.C. Therefore, Confederate authorities had comparatively less authority and support to levy direct taxes on the civilian population. While direct taxes (such as property taxes and a newly enacted income tax) on northern citizens made up approximately 20% of the U.S. government’s revenue during the Civil War, only around 8% of Confederate revenue throughout the war came from these same sources.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25008803P1'>Confederate authorities sought more options to boost the central government’s coffers and fund the war effort. In August 1861, the Confederate Congress passed the “War Tax,” which taxed Southern citizens for certain luxury items and property valued $500 or greater, including taxes on enslaved people. The funds realized from that tax did not prove sufficient for the expanding costs of war, leading the Confederate government in 1863 to implement a graduated income tax that placed a one percent tax on the first $1,500 earned, and then a two percent tax on additional wages. A more substantial program emerged in April 1863, based on a tithing system of civilians providing ten percent of their agricultural products. Known as the Impressment Act, many of the provisions and supplies gathered from this policy went directly to the Confederate military. These measures led to some fraud and corruption, as well as protest from southern civilians and officials of government overreach, but overall did provide important financial and supply support to the Confederate war effort.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95613P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the Department of Treasury by an act on February 21, 1861 in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of the Treasury appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by Christopher Memminger from February 21, 1861–July 18, 1864 and later by George Trenholm (July 18, 1864–April 27, 1865) and John Henninger Reagan (April 27–May 10, 1865). The Department of Treasury was responsible to superintend the collection of the public revenue and expenditures and advising the President and the Congress on all matters related to finance.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.
