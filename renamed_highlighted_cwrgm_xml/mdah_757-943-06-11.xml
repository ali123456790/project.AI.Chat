                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS97207P0'>John C. Pemberton was a Confederate general, most famous for commanding troops in the unsuccessful defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P1'>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 10, 1814, Pemberton was raised and educated in the north. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837, and immediately afterwards served as a U.S. artillery officer in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He remained a professional soldier for the next two decades, serving at various forts and posts in the United States, along the Canadian border, and in the west. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Pemberton served with the 4th U.S. Artillery and took part in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de La Palma, and Monterrey. He earned the brevet (honorary) rank of captain for his actions at Monterrey. He continued to serve with distinction at several other engagements in Mexico, including the storming of Chapultepec castle and the battle at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P2'>In 1848, following the Mexican-American War, Pemberton married Martha Thompson of Virginia. The couple had one daughter and three sons, all born in the 1850s. Pemberton continued to serve at a variety of posts in the United States, and saw additional action in Florida against the Seminoles from 1849 to 1850, and then again from 1856 to 1857. After spending a year in New Mexico Territory and three years in Minnesota, Pemberton was sent to Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1861, in the midst of the secession crisis. Despite his northern upbringing, Pemberton resigned his commission from the United States Army when the Civil War erupted in April 1861. He immediately volunteered for Confederate service and received an appointment as assistant adjutant general of Confederate forces at Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P3'>Because of his lengthy military experience, Pemberton rose quickly in Confederate ranks, reaching major general in January 1862. He was placed in command of the military department defending Georgia and South Carolina, but soon ran into conflict with the states’ governors who objected to Pemberton's assertion that the survival of his army was more important than defending the region, and due to mistrust of his northern heritage. Confederate President Jefferson Davis placed the more popular General P. G. T. Beauregard in charge of the defense of Georgia and South Carolina and relocated Pemberton to a new military department in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P4'>At his new assignment in Mississippi, in the fall of 1862, Pemberton received the promotion to lieutenant general. He was responsible for defending the Mississippi River and key port towns, such as Vicksburg, from federal attack. Unlike the more famous Confederate armies to the east, Pemberton’s command was made up of southern troops who had suffered several defeats against aggressive Union commanders at battles like Shiloh and Corinth. Many of Pemberton’s troops were separated, and he struggled to unite his force to stage an effective defense against Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army, which began a campaign for Vicksburg in December 1862. Making matters worse for the Confederate general, his orders were to hold Vicksburg at all cost—meaning that he had limited ability to maneuver or even withdraw to save his army in the face of Grant’s larger force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P5'>Between December 1862 and July 1863, Grant conducted a slow, creative, but ultimately persistent campaign to surround and capture Vicksburg. Utilizing his aggressive subordinate William T. Sherman, Grant cut Pemberton and his Confederate troops off at Vicksburg and burned Mississippi’s capital of Jackson in May 1863. After being besieged in Vicksburg by Grant’s troops for six weeks, Pemberton realized he had no other choice but to surrender. On July 4, 1863, Pemberton ordered his army to lay down its arms and open Vicksburg to Grant’s army. The defeat occurred one day after Robert E. Lee’s battlefield loss at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, delivering a double blow to Confederate morale.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P6'>Pemberton and his men were captured and paroled by Union forces—a practice by which prisoners were allowed to return home or to encampments under the sworn oath not to take up arms until formally exchanged for Union prisoners. Pemberton traveled to Richmond where he remained idle for several months. Not receiving a new assignment, he resigned his general’s commission in May 1864. President Davis offered him a conciliatory assignment as a lieutenant colonel of artillery, which he accepted. He temporarily commanded the artillery defense of Richmond before taking an appointment as inspector general of artillery. Pemberton was captured by Union troops in mid-April 1865 during the final days of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P7'>Following the Civil War, Pemberton moved to Warrenton, Virginia. He remained there until 1876, when he moved back to Pennsylvania. He lived quietly on a farm, passing away in 1881. Pemberton is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS101737P0'>John Robinson Waddy was a military officer that served in the U.S. Army in the 1850s and then as a Confederate officer during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101737P1'>Born on December 29, 1834, in Virginia, Waddy graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1853 and commissioned as a lieutenant in the Fourth U.S. Artillery Regiment. He served at various outposts, including in Kansas Territory during the late 1850s. When the Civil War broke out in 1861 and his home state of Virginia declared itself seceded from the Union, Waddy resigned his commission and volunteered for Confederate service. He was commissioned as an officer in the Confederate Army and spent much of the war as an adjutant general. He also served as an ordnance and artillery officer, and was a colonel in command of artillery units within Joseph E. Johnston’s army when it surrendered to Union forces in North Carolina in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101737P2'>Waddy returned to Virginia after being pardoned by federal officials, but relocated to New York City and lived there for most of the Reconstruction period. He moved back to Virginia in 1877 and worked as inspector-in-chief of grain shipments for the Norfolk and Western Railroad Company. Waddy died on February 10, 1903. He was married to Ella Fitchett and had eight children. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P0'>Cotton is a native plant to the Americas which produces puffy bolls of soft white fibers used for clothing and fabric production since the prehistoric era. There are two main species of cotton—distinguished primarily by their fiber length. Short staple cotton has shorter fibers but can grow across a broader geographical area in the southern United States. Long staple cotton is considered by many to produce higher quality, softer fibers, but is more tropical and frost sensitive, isolating it to the warm coastal areas of the lower south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P1'>Long staple cotton became a highly prized cash crop for seventeenth and eighteenth century farmers in the lower south, particularly along the South Carolina and Georgia coastline. Sea Island cotton was carefully cultivated and developed by planters who imported long fiber plants from Central and South America to improve the quality. This lucrative crop was labor intensive, requiring laborers to pick the bolls by hand—a task increasingly given to enslaved people. Once collected, the cotton bolls had to be processed to remove seeds so the fibers could be spun into thread and the seeds used for planting or for cottonseed oil production. Early American cotton planters used a simple cotton gin (or cotton engine), originally designed in India in the fifth century, to mechanically separate seeds from the long staple fibers. This basic gin did not work with short fiber cotton. Because of this, short staple cotton was not a popular crop during the colonial era, as the manual labor required to separate seeds from the bolls was time and cost prohibitive.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P2'>This changed in the 1790s when inventor Eli Whitney designed a new cotton gin that could efficiently separate seeds from short staple cotton. The design immediately made the heartier short fiber cotton plant a viable cash crop and spurred the expansion of cotton farming—on large plantations to small farms—across the south. The pursuit of new farmland for cotton production drove westward migration, the displacement of Native Americans in the south, and helped the creation of new states, including Alabama and Mississippi. The cotton gin only mechanized the processing of cotton. Harvesting the cotton bolls was still done by hand (machine harvesting would not become prevalent until the twentieth century). Therefore, the expansion of cotton farms across the south brought with it the rapid growth of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P3'>Planters produced 750,000 bales of cotton in 1830. Twenty years later, in 1850, the south produced 2.85 million bales annually. In 1860, American planters delivered 5.3 million bales. At 400 pounds per bale, the United States produced more than two billion pounds of cotton in 1860. The crop dominated southern agriculture and made the United States one of the world’s top exporters of the product, chiefly to textile mills in England and France. At the eve of the Civil War, southern politicians believed the importance of the south’s cotton exports gave it diplomatic leverage over European powers. Senator James Hammond of South Carolina famously quipped that “no power on earth dares to make war upon [cotton]. Cotton is king.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P4'>Southern secessionist ideas of cotton’s diplomatic influence during the Civil War proved misplaced. The decrease of cotton exports, due to the Union naval blockade and even efforts by Confederate politicians to create international demand by burning 2.5 million bales of southern cotton, failed to coerce England or France to formally side with the Confederacy or make war upon the Union. Strong cotton crops in the 1850s had led to a surplus of cotton in Europe, and Great Britain chose to find alternate sources of cotton (such as India and Egypt) rather than engage embroil itself in the American Civil War. Some desperate southern farmers even traded with federal officials, and occupying Union forces confiscated cotton crops and transferred them north to textile manufacturers in the northeast.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P5'>After the Civil War, cotton production remained an important agricultural interest for the south. The abolition of slavery did not end the role African Americans played as the primary source of labor for cotton harvesting. Freed peoples grew their own cotton crops as tenant farmers or sharecroppers across the south through the late nineteenth century, resulting in the south continually exporting millions of bales each year. Although a lucrative crop, the cotton farmers—white and black—rarely enjoyed wealth from their labor, due to periodic market crashes and competition. Cotton farming did not substantially change until the early twentieth century with the advent of mechanized cotton harvesters. (Wikipedia; census.gov; Eugene R. Dattel, “Cotton and the Civil War,” Mississippi History Now; “Cotton Sector at a Glance,” Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.
