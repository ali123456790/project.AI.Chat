                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52203P0'>James H. Rives was a Confederate soldier and the Mississippi governor’s private secretary during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52203P1'>Born in 1830 in Georgia, Rives moved to Noxubee County, Mississippi, as a young man and became a practicing attorney. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Rives volunteered for military service, and was commissioned as an officer in a militia company named the Noxubee Rifles. He received a commission in the Confederate army when the company was incorporated into the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment as Company F.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52203P2'>By late 1862, Rives had left the regiment and accepted an appointment as private secretary to Mississippi governor John J. Pettus. He served in that role for most of 1863. After the war, Rives returned to Noxubee County and practiced law. He married Leona Cotton in 1868 and had at least one daughter. Rives was active in Noxubee County politics in the late 1860s and early 1870s, and was called before the U.S. Congress to testify to about race relations in Mississippi in 1871. He died in 1875.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD86078P0'>Insurrection is an organized attempt by a group of people to overthrow a government, usually by violence. The cause, participants, and size of an effort to overthrow authority can vary. However, political and military officials typically respond to insurrections with legal and military force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P1'>The United States Constitution refers to insurrection in Article 1, Section 8, where it authorizes Congress to “provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.” Southern secession activities were not called insurrectionary until Confederates fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, turning the tense political debate over the legality of unilateral state secession into open warfare. At that point, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to enforce federal authority in the South and described the seceded states as engaging in insurrection. The term carries important legal connotations. International law does not recognize insurrectionists as legal combatants in war. By late 1861, Lincoln preferred to describe the South as in a state of “rebellion” instead of insurrection—a term with the same technical meaning, but which more strongly characterized the Confederacy as engaging in an unjust resistance to authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P2'>Confederates also feared political insurrection within the South during Civil War. Support for secession was not universal through the Southern states, and numerous communities—particularly in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, northern Alabama, and most famously western Virginia (which actually separated and created its own state of West Virginia in 1863)—harbored pro-Union sentiments. Confederate and secessionist state officials frequently described anti-Confederate resistance within these communities and other parts of the South as insurrectionary. They used state and Confederate military forces to suppress such opposition.

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P3'>Nineteenth century Southerners most commonly used the term insurrection to describe physical resistance by slaves against their masters. When the Union Army began to employ African American soldiers in 1863, the Confederate government announced that white Union officers captured while commanding black soldiers would be executed for inciting “servile insurrection.” The Confederacy backed down from that threat when Lincoln’s administration responded that it would execute one Confederate prisoner for each Union soldier killed, but the policy reflected the long-standing Southern fear of slave insurrections or rebellions. Before, during, and even after the Civil War, white Southern officials called out local militias—or even unregulated groups of armed men—to reestablish authority over African Americans suspected or accused of insurrection, often with overly violent methods. (Gaines M. Foster, “What’s Not in a Name: The Naming of the American Civil War,” <hi rend='italic'>Journal of the Civil War Era</hi>, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Sept 2018), 417-419; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99666P0'>In warfare, an army moving into an enemy’s home territory is often described as an invasion. During the American Civil War, most examples of military forces moving into enemy territory involved Union armies advancing into Confederate states. Some of these incursions were temporary, such as small cavalry raids to destroy Confederate supplies and even larger campaigns behind Confederate lines to harm Southern infrastructure (such as William T. Sherman’s “March Through Georgia”). However, Union victory in the Civil War depended upon the United States Army conducting offensive operations and occupying large portions of the South. These efforts split apart the Confederacy, placed secessionist communities back under federal control, and reduced the Confederate armies’ ability to wage war. Pro-secessionist Southerners considered these efforts to be federal invasions, and described communities captured by Union armies as being overrun. However, pro-Union Southerners cheered the arrival of Union soldiers, considering them liberators rather than invaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99666P1'>Although the Confederacy fought a defensive war, Southern military forces occasionally conducted incursions into northern communities. Robert E. Lee’s Maryland Campaign in 1862 (which culminated in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862) was seen by many Marylanders as an invasion of their state. His second offensive campaign into the North, in the summer of 1863, was widely reported in the Northern press as a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. That campaign ultimately resulted in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P0'>An immigrant is "a person who has come to a different country in order to live there permanently" (Cambridge Dictionary). Immigrants from other nations have always comprised a significant portion of the U.S. population, yet the number was relatively small until the middle decades of the nineteenth century, when political and economic turmoil in Europe forced many people to flee. Immigrants came from all over the world, though the vast majority (90.4 percent by one estimation) came from Europe (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 54). In the West, and particularly in California, the United States also saw a large increase in Chinese and Japanese-born immigrants.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P1'>Immigrants came to the United States for varied reasons. Many Eastern and Western Europeans immigrated to flee religious or political persecution, while immigrants from around the world sought to improve their economic circumstances in the U. S. Immigrants to the U. S. settled overwhelmingly in urban centers, though some few also settled in rural areas of the South and Midwest.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P2'>Immigration often led to racial, ethnic, and class conflicts. Many native-born, white, Protestant Americans feared the ethnic and religious differences of immigrants as well as the potential economic competition they represented. This led to the rise of nativism, or discrimination and often violence against those born outside of the U. S., and the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know-Nothing Party in the 1840s and 1850s. Free African Americans and white European immigrants who both often faced discrimination and poverty also perceived each other as economic competition. This tension occasionally produced outbreaks of violence like the New York City Draft Riots of 1863 in which predominantly Catholic Irish and German immigrants, having been drafted into the U. S. Army but refusing to fight for Black freedom, rioted in response to the Emancipation Proclamation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P3'>Ultimately, the American Civil War placed native-born and foreign-born soldiers alongside each other in battle, cooling the nativist sentiments of the decades prior; however, non-European immigrants, especially Chinese-born, continued to face discrimination based on their immigrant status. (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 53-100; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD101123P0'>Across the nineteenth century, British immigrants (coming from England, Wales, or Scotland) to the United States fared better than almost any other group. The close cultural, religious, social, and linguistic ties between Great Britain and the United States rendered British assimilation to the U.S. far easier than others, while over half of British immigrants to the U.S. came as skilled workers and therefore found well-paying jobs in manufacturing textiles (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 73-6).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD101123P1'>Both rapidly industrializing nations, Great Britain and the United States became economic competitors, yet their economies became integrally linked as cotton from the U. S. South fueled Britain's booming textile industry. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, politicians in Great Britain hotly debated whether to support the Union or Confederacy. While anti-British sentiment remained strongest in the North, the South's ties to slavery were diplomatically unwise for a Great Britain that had abolished slavery decades before. Both the U. S. and Confederacy sent emissaries to Great Britain, which throughout the war remained officially neutral. In practice, the British supplied munitions, built ships, and smuggled cotton for the Confederacy. However, Great Britain never formally recognized the Confederate States of America as a distinct nation, thereby crippling it diplomatically and aiding the Union war effort (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
