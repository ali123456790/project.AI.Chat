                    <p xml:id='OTPS52212P0'>James Zachariah George was a Confederate officer and U.S. senator from Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P1'>Born in Monroe County, Georgia, on October 20, 1826, George moved to Mississippi as a child, first to Noxubee County and then to Carroll County. He volunteered for military service in 1846 for the Mexican-American War and served under the command of Colonel Jefferson Davis, who later was elected president of the Confederate States of America. George saw combat at the Battle of Monterey. Following the Mexican-American War, George returned to Mississippi and studied law. He was appointed a reporter of Mississippi’s Supreme Court in 1854 and spent two decades compiling a multi-volume collection of legal cases.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P2'>George was selected to be a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in January 1861. He was a slave owner and supported the state’s separation from the Union, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to president in November 1860. When the Civil War erupted in the spring of 1861, George volunteered for military service. He received a commission as captain over Company C, 20th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, but resigned in October 1862 when offered a commission as brigadier general in the Mississippi State Troops. He remained in the state service for one year before rejoining the Confederate army (reportedly due to frustration with the Mississippi militia’s poor organization and resources), taking the rank of colonel to command the 5th Mississippi Cavalry. George was captured by Union forces during the Civil War, and spent time in a prisoner of war camp.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P3'>After the Civil War, George practiced law in Mississippi and formed a very successful law firm with Wiley P. Harris. He was a vocal defendant of white supremacy during Reconstruction, and reportedly influenced Republican Governer Adelbert Ames to not arm African American militias in Mississippi during tensions over the 1875 election. Democrats used promises like this to weaken resistance to a campaign of violence and intimidation against African American and Republican voters. As a result, Democrats scored a major electoral victory in Mississippi, helping overturn federal Reconstruction policies designed to protect Black civil rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P4'>In 1879, George received an appointment to the Mississippi Supreme Court. However, he did not remain there long, since he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1880. He won reelection in 1886 and 1892. He was a vocal proponent for a Mississippi constitutional convention in 1890 to disenfranchise Black southerners, and successfully argued in its defense in front of the Senate and the Supreme Court. George was popular among conservative white Mississippians, in part because he crafted legal exceptions to Mississippi’s voting laws that protect poor whites while denying suffrage to African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P5'>George died in 1897 in Mississippi City, Mississippi. He had been married to Elizabeth B. Young. The couple had seven children between 1848 and 1862, five of whom survived to adulthood. George is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in North Carrollton, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94826P0'>Desertion is the act of a military service member permanently leaving a unit without permission. It is considered a worse offense than being temporarily absent without leave (AWOL). Deserters were often accused of cowardice, especially during the early part of the Civil War, when enthusiasm for battle ran high. While soldiers arrested for desertion very early in the war faced loss of pay, Union and Confederate officers treated it more harshly as the war progressed. Some deserters faced corporal punishment and humiliation, while most others were imprisoned. In some instances, military authorities recommended the death penalty for desertion. However, most saw their death sentence commuted and instead faced imprisonment with hard labor. For example, the Union’s Army of Potomac captured roughly 2,000 deserters between July and November 1863. Of those, 80 received death sentences but only 21 were actually executed—around one percent of the total number of deserters. Those that were executed most often had their sentence carried out in front of their fellow soldiers, as a warning to other, would-be deserters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94826P1'>Reasons for desertion differed. Some soldiers fled from fear of battle, while many others ran away due to issues at home. Some Confederate soldiers deserted when their units were sent on campaigns outside their native state. This was not a problem among Union soldiers, who largely expected to march away from home to battle secessionists in the South. But, in the midst of the South’s highly charged climate of state sovereignty and home defense, not all Southern volunteers approved of being transferred for Confederate military service. One Mississippi soldier reported that as many as 125 members of his regiment deserted after they were sent to support Confederate forces in northern Georgia. Similar incidents happened with units across the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94826P2'>The two most common reasons for desertion were unfavorable conditions within the military (such as poor quality food, shoddy equipment, or discontent with military leadership) and loss of faith in the war effort. The latter reason plagued the Confederacy in particular toward the end of the war. Concerned for their families as Union armies occupied much of the South, or believing that victory was impossible, tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers slipped away from their units in late 1864 and early 1865 never to return. These desertions severely weakened Confederate armies and contributed to lower morale, which in turn led to more desertions. In all, an estimated 103,000 Confederate soldiers and 200,000 Union soldiers deserted during the Civil War. (Wikipedia; Encyclopedia of Virginia; Mark A.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P0'>The term cavalry referred to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of Civil War armies, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies typically used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P1'>Confederate cavalrymen enjoyed a reputation of superiority over their Union counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that Confederate cavalry soldiers often had to provide their own horses (something less common in the Union army) and therefore were more experienced and comfortable with their steeds. Two other theories are that Southern aristocratic culture placed higher value on horsemanship than northern communities, and that men who grew up in the South’s largely agricultural society were more familiar with horses than those from the industrial North. All of these explanations may have some merit, but exaggerate the differences between North and South, and cannot account for any great disparity in cavalry actions within the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P2'>More important reasons for Confederate cavalry’s positive reputation included some high-profile leaders and notable early war victories. J.E.B. Stuart’s battlefield success in the Eastern Theater during the first two years, coupled with his flamboyant style, made him and his horse soldiers celebrities in the South, while other cavalry commanders, like John Hunt Morgan, John Singleton Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, used aggressive and rapid cavalry raids to disrupt northern supply lines, defeat isolated federal troops, and generally tie up exponentially larger Union forces. Despite these early and famous Confederate successes, Union cavalry forces improved in quality and quantity during the course of the war, culminating in a fight to a draw at Brandy Station—the largest cavalry battle in North America—in June 1863. During the last two years of the war, Confederate cavalry did not enjoy its reputation of dominance, although it still managed to play a large role in scouting, raiding, and resisting Union forces.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P.

The troops in camp, understand this inability to get <del rend='overstrike'>their</del> absentees in as an evidence of the weakness of the state authority, &amp; hence throw off all restraint, &amp; are constantly leaving.

Most of them are without any military spirit &amp; are if possible, more pressing on their importunities to get <rs ref='#S102538'>furloughs</rs> than the men. As a general rule they refuse to exercise any control or authority over the men. Of course there are a few exceptions to this, but associated as they are with the others who will not exercise authority or enforce discipline, the few who try to do their duty, can accomplish but little.
