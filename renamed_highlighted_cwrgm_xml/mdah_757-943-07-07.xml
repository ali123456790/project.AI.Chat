                    <p xml:id='OTPS52212P0'>James Zachariah George was a Confederate officer and U.S. senator from Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P1'>Born in Monroe County, Georgia, on October 20, 1826, George moved to Mississippi as a child, first to Noxubee County and then to Carroll County. He volunteered for military service in 1846 for the Mexican-American War and served under the command of Colonel Jefferson Davis, who later was elected president of the Confederate States of America. George saw combat at the Battle of Monterey. Following the Mexican-American War, George returned to Mississippi and studied law. He was appointed a reporter of Mississippi’s Supreme Court in 1854 and spent two decades compiling a multi-volume collection of legal cases.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P2'>George was selected to be a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in January 1861. He was a slave owner and supported the state’s separation from the Union, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to president in November 1860. When the Civil War erupted in the spring of 1861, George volunteered for military service. He received a commission as captain over Company C, 20th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, but resigned in October 1862 when offered a commission as brigadier general in the Mississippi State Troops. He remained in the state service for one year before rejoining the Confederate army (reportedly due to frustration with the Mississippi militia’s poor organization and resources), taking the rank of colonel to command the 5th Mississippi Cavalry. George was captured by Union forces during the Civil War, and spent time in a prisoner of war camp.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P3'>After the Civil War, George practiced law in Mississippi and formed a very successful law firm with Wiley P. Harris. He was a vocal defendant of white supremacy during Reconstruction, and reportedly influenced Republican Governer Adelbert Ames to not arm African American militias in Mississippi during tensions over the 1875 election. Democrats used promises like this to weaken resistance to a campaign of violence and intimidation against African American and Republican voters. As a result, Democrats scored a major electoral victory in Mississippi, helping overturn federal Reconstruction policies designed to protect Black civil rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P4'>In 1879, George received an appointment to the Mississippi Supreme Court. However, he did not remain there long, since he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1880. He won reelection in 1886 and 1892. He was a vocal proponent for a Mississippi constitutional convention in 1890 to disenfranchise Black southerners, and successfully argued in its defense in front of the Senate and the Supreme Court. George was popular among conservative white Mississippians, in part because he crafted legal exceptions to Mississippi’s voting laws that protect poor whites while denying suffrage to African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P5'>George died in 1897 in Mississippi City, Mississippi. He had been married to Elizabeth B. Young. The couple had seven children between 1848 and 1862, five of whom survived to adulthood. George is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in North Carrollton, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.
