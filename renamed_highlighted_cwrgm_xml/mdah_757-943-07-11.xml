                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS104425P0'>Robert Edward Lee was the Confederacy’s most famous general, commanding the primary southern army in the eastern theater from 1862 to 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P1'>Born on January 19, 1807, at Stratford Hall, Virginia, Lee was the son of a famed veteran of the American Revolution. Although his father fell into financial despair and abandoned the family, Lee maintained a good reputation and received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated second in his class in 1829 and shortly afterwards married Mary Anna Randolph Custis, the great-grand daughter of Mary Washington (George Washington’s wife). The couple eventually had seven children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P2'>Lee served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for nearly two decades before serving on the staff of General Winfield Scott during the Mexican-American War in the mid-1840s. He performed very well during the war, receiving three brevet (honorary) promotions (major, lieutenant colonel, and then colonel) for his actions Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. After the war, Lee served at various army posts before receiving an administrative position at West Point. He was the superintendent of the military academy from 1852 to 1855. He then received a field assignment as second-in-command of the Second Cavalry Regiment in Texas, under future Confederate general Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P3'>In 1857, Lee’s father-in-law passed away, leaving Lee and his wife Mary to inherit significant amounts of land—including a large plantation and home in Arlington, Virginia, across the river from Washington, D.C.—hundreds of slaves, and a large debt. Lee took time away from the military to get the properties and finances in order, which involved overseeing the work, discipline, and sale of enslaved laborers. In 1859, while in Virginia, Lee was called to lead military forces against John Brown’s abolitionists who had attacked the U.S. arsenal at Harper’s Ferry as part of an effort to spark a slave rebellion in the south. When Lee arrived, Brown’s group was surrounded in a brick building. When Brown refused orders to surrender, Lee instructed his troops to attack, and they captured Brown and killed or captured his followers within minutes. The event made national news in the already tense political battle between pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests in the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P4'>When southern states began declaring their separation from the Union following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860, Lee initially opposed secession. However, after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in April 1861, prompting Lincoln to call for volunteers to defeat the secessionists, Lee’s home state of Virginia officially joined the Confederacy. Lee was offered high ranking command in the Union, but he declined. He resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for military service within Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P5'>Lee’s first military assignment was command of Confederate troops in modern-day western Virginia. He suffered defeats in small battles there in 1861, but retained his reputation as an able officer and took a position as an advisor to Confederate president Jefferson Davis in Richmond. Then, in the summer of 1862, Lee was placed in command of an army defending the Confederate capital from Union forces, after General Joseph E. Johnston was wounded. Lee’s aggressive attacks prompted the Union army, under cautious commander General George B. McClellan, to withdraw, thereby elevating Lee’s reputation as a savior of the Confederacy. For the rest of the war, Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia were the Confederacy’s most famous and successful military force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P6'>Lee proved to be a creative commander, willing to take risks and attack aggressively to overcome his opponents’ superiority in size. Lee often chose good positions to defend, and then ordered strategic counterattacks to disrupt and defeat Union forces. Among his greatest victories were the Battle of Second Manassas in August 1862 and the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, in which he thoroughly defeated much larger Union armies through surprise flank attacks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P7'>Lee’s military gambles did not always succeed. He conducted only two offensive campaigns during the Civil War—into Maryland in September 1862 and into Pennsylvania in 1863. Both were intended to draw Union forces away from Virginia. He also hoped military victories on battlefields further north would more effectively harm the Union war effort, and possibly draw the border state of Maryland into the Confederacy. However, Lee lost both campaigns after a single major battle (Antietam in Maryland, and Gettysburg in Pennsylvania), in turn invigorating the Union war effort. President Abraham Lincoln used the Union victory of Lee at Antietam in September 1862 to announce his intention to issue an Emancipation Proclamation declaring freedom for all enslaved people within Confederate territories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P8'>By 1864, Lee had abandoned plans for offensive strategic operations. Other than ordering limited and diversionary assaults, he spent the rest of the war using the Army of Northern Virginia to defend Richmond. That spring, Ulysses S. Grant was placed in charge of Union forces in Virginia and began a stubborn advance to capture the Confederate capital. The result was a series of deadly battles in northern Virginia, followed by a lengthy stand off around Petersburg, Virginia. In the spring of 1865, Grant’s forces broke Lee’s defensive line, forcing the Confederates to abandon Richmond and retreat southward. Overwhelmed and cut off by superior numbers, Lee formally surrendered in April 1865 at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. Although not the last Confederate army to surrender, Lee’s capitulation signaled to most people in the north and south that the Confederacy had been defeated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P9'>After the war, Lee returned to Virginia. The U.S. government had confiscated his family home at Arlington and turned it into a war cemetery. Lee’s family sued the federal government and eventually received some financial compensation. The estate is now preserved by the U.S. government as Arlington National Cemetery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P10'>In October 1865, Lee accepted an appointment as president of Washington College (modern-day Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. His fame helped draw money to the school, and he proved to be a very capable administrator. Lee died on October 12, 1870, from complications of a stroke and pneumonia. He is entombed in the University Chapel Museum at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25002719P0'>Martin Luther Smith was a northern-born Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P1'>Born September 9, 1819, in Danby New York, Smith graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1842. His first military assignment was as a civil engineer in the U.S. Army in Florida. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Smith served as an engineer and cartographer, drawing detailed maps for U.S. commanders, such as General Winfield Scott, during campaigns in Mexico.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P2'>Smith was still in the U.S. Army when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Although born in the north, he was sympathetic to the southern secession and the Confederacy. He had married a woman from Georgia and spent most of his military career in the south. As a result, he resigned from the army and volunteered for Confederate service. Initially commissioned a major in the engineers, he was promoted to colonel and assigned command of the Twenty-first Louisiana Infantry Regiment in February 1862. After assisting in planning the defense of New Orleans, Louisiana, Smith was promoted to brigadier general and transferred back to the engineers. In May 1862, he was placed in command of the defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and remained there during Ulysses S. Grant’s 1863 campaign, siege, and capture of the city. Held as a prisoner until early 1864, Smith received command of the Confederate Army’s Engineer Corps after his parole from a Union prison camp. In April 1864, he received an appointment as the chief engineer for the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee. Confederate officials then moved him to different commands, including the Army of Tennessee and then the Confederate Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. Among his last assignment was overseeing the defenses of Mobile, Alabama, under General P. G. T. Beauregard. When Union troops captured Mobile in 1865, Smith traveled to Athens, Georgia, where he surrendered in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P3'>After the Civil War, Smith moved to Savannah, Georgia, and began a civil engineering firm. He also served as the chief engineer of the Selma, Rome, and Dalton Railroad.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.
