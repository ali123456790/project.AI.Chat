                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P0'>The act of beginning to fight or a period of time in a war, military engagements are also referred to as battles or skirmishes. Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD104719P0'>The Battle of Shiloh (also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing) was fought on April 6 – 7, 1862 in Hardin County, Tennessee between the Army of the Tennessee (Union) commanded by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant against the Army of Mississippi (Confederate) commanded by Gen. Sidney Albert Johnston, and later, by Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard. It resulted in a Union victory. After the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson in February of 1862, Johnston withdrew Confederate forces from Kentucky and central and western Tennessee, opening Mississippi and Alabama to attack from the Union Army. Johnston suspected that Grant would attack Corinth, Mississippi, the hub of the Ohio and Mobile and Memphis and Charleston railroads, an important Confederate supply route. He gathered his forces at Corinth and marched north to Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee to attack Grant before Union reinforcements could arrive.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD104719P1'>Fighting began on the morning of April 6. Initially, Johnston’s forces had the element of surprise, attacking Union soldiers at their camp and driving them back toward Pittsburgh Landing. Union forces regrouped and counter-attacked. That afternoon, Johnston was shot in his knee, the ball severing an artery and killing him from blood loss. Command fell to Beauregard who believed his forces were victorious and ordered the attack halted as darkness fell that evening. Grant, receiving reinforcements overnight, launched an attack on the morning of April 7. Beauregard counter-attacked, but the two sides reached a stalemate. That afternoon Beauregard realized that Grant was reinforced, and he was outnumbered. He retreated with his forces to Corinth. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 110,053; 65,085 Union and 44,968 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 23,746 with 13,047 Union and 10,669 Confederate. The Confederate defeat at Shiloh gave the Union access to several hundred miles of the Mississippi River to launch operations further into to South. Also of note, Sidney Albert Johnston would be the highest-ranking Confederate general killed in the war (American Battlefield Trust; Tennessee Encyclopedia; Encyclopedia Britannica)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58310P0'>The status of "orphan" is defined in the United States as "a minor bereft through death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by, or separation or loss from, both parents" (Wikipedia). CWRGM also applies this term to identify military orphans, or a child whose mother is still living but whose father died in military service. Orphans in the nineteenth-century often came from a variety of backgrounds and had an equal variety of experiences. While the death of both parents, usually from disease, certainly left many children orphaned, poverty remained the primary cause by which a child could be sent to live at an orphanage. The rise of industrialism in the U. S. brought about a concurrent rise in poverty, particularly in the nation's cities. Many impoverished parents either abandoned their children at orphanages or asked that orphanages take in their children to provide them with the food, shelter, medicine, and in certain cases education that working-class parents could not. Children could spend months or years in orphanages, though many forced them to return to their families or go out on their own by age 15 or 16. Most orphanages were privately owned and operated by religious or reform organizations, though some states increasingly sponsored institutional homes for orphans by the end of the nineteenth century. While the vast majority of orphanages operated in major eastern cities, the so-called "orphan train" process sent orphans by train to rural areas of the country, where reformers thought that family life and agricultural work would keep them from the moral corruption of the city. Orphans of different races, religions, and ethnicities also experienced orphanages differently, as many excluded non-white, immigrant, and Jewish orphans. Ultimately, the devastation of the Civil War and the widespread poverty of industrialism in the U. S. produced an unprecedented number of orphans, and their care became a principal cause among reformers throughout the nineteenth century (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 454-6).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P. Lowry, <hi rend='italic'>The Story the Soldiers Wouldn't Tell</hi>, 104–108)
