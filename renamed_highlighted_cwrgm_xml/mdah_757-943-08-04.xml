                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32118160P0'>Jehu Amaziah Orr was a representative of Mississippi in the Confederate States Congress during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P1'>Born on May 10, 1828, in Anderson County, South Carolina, he moved to Mississippi as a child. He graduated from Erskine College in South Carolina, before attending Princeton University in late 1840s. He left Princeton before graduation due to illness, but returned to earn a Master’s degree there in 1857. Orr became a prominent figure in Mississippi politics as a young man, being appointed as secretary to a Mississippi state convention on slavery in 1849, and later serving as secretary of the Mississippi Senate, a state representation, a district attorney, and then in 1861 being elected a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P2'>Once Mississippi joined the Confederacy, Orr won a seat representing Mississippi at the Confederate Provisional Congress in Montgomery, Alabama. In early 1862, he stepped away from politics to command the Thirty-First Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He led the unit through several battles, until 1864 when he returned to politics and took a seat in the Confederate House of Representatives, which he held until the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P3'>After the war Orr returned to practicing law. He served as judge of Mississippi’s Sixth Judicial District from 1869 to 1876, and then ran a very successful law firm, serving as the attorney for the Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad Company. He was married to Cornelia Ewing Van de Graaff and had four children. Late in his life, Orr became an outspoken supporter of women’s voting rights alongside his daughter Pauline Van de Graaff Orr, a notable suffragist. He was among the last surviving members of the Confederate Congress, and was widely praised in the early twentieth century for his more progressive views toward racial and social equality compared to his former Confederate colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32118160P4'>Orr died in on March 9, 1921, at his daughter’s home in New York. He was 92 years old. He is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74655P0'>Sterling Price was a U.S. politician before the Civil War and then a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P1'>Born in September 1809 in Prince Edward County, Virginia, Price received a moderate education and studied law in Virginia before moving to Missouri around 1830. He entered local politics and in 1836 won election to Missouri’s House of Representatives. He joined the state militia and stepped away from the legislature to participate in anti-Mormon military activities in the state in the late 1830s. After the Mormon conflict, Price focused on farming a large amount of land he had received from his father in Missouri. He owned several dozen slaves during this period, and became a strong advocate for the institution of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P2'>In 1842, Price again entered the Missouri legislature. Then, in 1844, he successfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives. When the Mexican-American War started in 1846, he volunteered for military service and took command of the Second Missouri Mounted Infantry Regiment. In early 1847, Price was sent to New Mexico, where he defeated an insurrection by Pueblo and Hispano people, and was then appointed military governor over the territory. He then saw some combat against a small Mexican force at the very end of the Mexican-American War. Price returned to Missouri as a war hero, which he used for political gain, becoming governor in 1853. Among the more notable developments that occurred during his four years in office include the creation of Washington University in St. Louis and the expansion of railroad development. Price spent the latter part of the 1850s as Missouri’s Bank Commissioner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P3'>Price publicly opposed secession in the wake of Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860. He presided over Missouri’s convention in February 1861, which voted to remain in the Union. However, he privately worked with pro-secessionist governor Claiborne Fox Jackson to strengthen the Missouri militia in support of the Confederacy. When federal forces under Nathaniel Lyon clashed with the militiamen near St. Louis in May 1861, Price formally backed the Confederacy. Taking command of the Missouri State Guard and pro-secession forces, he defeated a Union army under Lyon at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek in August 1861. He then saw battlefield success at Lexington, Missouri, in September 1861. Commissioned as a major general in the Confederate Army in March 1862, he was defeated in battle at Pea Ridge, Arkansas, and then lost at Iuka and Corinth in Mississippi. Price continued to lead Confederate troops in minor engagements in 1863, and then carried out an ambitious offensive campaign into Missouri and Kansas in late 1864. He scored several minor victories during the campaign, but was defeated at Westport, near modern-day Kansas City, Missouri. Price’s army retreated southward along the Kansas-Missouri border, losing additional engagements and withdrawing into Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74655P4'>Price chose to go into Mexico rather than surrender to Union forces in 1865. He and several ex-Confederates tried to create a colony in Carlota, Veracruz. In 1866, after Mexican officials proved unsupportive of the colony, Price returned to Missouri. He suffered from numerous health problems, many related to conditions he had contracted during his various military experiences over the previous years, including cholera. He died on September 29, 1867. Price was married to Martha Head and had six children who survived to adulthood. He is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS101965P0'>William Feimster Tucker was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P1'>Born on May 9, 1827, in Iredell County, North Carolina, Tucker graduated from Emory and Henry College in Virginia in 1848. He moved to Houston, Mississippi, and studied law, soon securing a seat as probate judge in Chickasaw County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P2'>Tucker volunteered for Confederate military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He was commissioned as a captain in the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment and saw action at the First Battle of Bull Run. Tucker was later transferred to the western theater, and placed in command of the Forty-first Mississippi Infantry Regiment, where he participated in several battles in Kentucky and Tennessee in 1862 and 1863. In March 1864, he was promoted to brigadier general and commanded Confederate troops against Union forces under William Tecumseh Sherman during the Atlanta Campaign. Tucker was severely wounded at the Battle of Resaca in May 1864 and was forced to retire from field duty. He recovered enough to hold take command of the District of Southern Mississippi and East Louisiana during the final weeks of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P3'>After the Civil War, Tucker returned to Mississippi to practice law. He ran for state political office at the end of Reconstruction, winning two terms in the state’s House of Representatives in the late 1870s. He was murdered on September 14, 1881, in Okolona, Mississippi, when an unknown assailant fired a gun through Tucker’s bedroom window, killing him instantly. The death was suspected to be an assassination, possibly stemming from one of Tucker’s legal cases. Several people were questioned, and two men arrested, but no one was convicted of the murder.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P4'>Tucker was married to Martha Josephine Chackelford. The couple had at least six children that lived to adulthood. Tucker is buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Okolona, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P0'>The term cavalry referred to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of Civil War armies, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies typically used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P1'>Confederate cavalrymen enjoyed a reputation of superiority over their Union counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that Confederate cavalry soldiers often had to provide their own horses (something less common in the Union army) and therefore were more experienced and comfortable with their steeds. Two other theories are that Southern aristocratic culture placed higher value on horsemanship than northern communities, and that men who grew up in the South’s largely agricultural society were more familiar with horses than those from the industrial North. All of these explanations may have some merit, but exaggerate the differences between North and South, and cannot account for any great disparity in cavalry actions within the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P2'>More important reasons for Confederate cavalry’s positive reputation included some high-profile leaders and notable early war victories. J.E.B. Stuart’s battlefield success in the Eastern Theater during the first two years, coupled with his flamboyant style, made him and his horse soldiers celebrities in the South, while other cavalry commanders, like John Hunt Morgan, John Singleton Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, used aggressive and rapid cavalry raids to disrupt northern supply lines, defeat isolated federal troops, and generally tie up exponentially larger Union forces. Despite these early and famous Confederate successes, Union cavalry forces improved in quality and quantity during the course of the war, culminating in a fight to a draw at Brandy Station—the largest cavalry battle in North America—in June 1863. During the last two years of the war, Confederate cavalry did not enjoy its reputation of dominance, although it still managed to play a large role in scouting, raiding, and resisting Union forces.
