                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS99295P0'>Edward Herndon Hicks was an attorney and politician in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS99295P1'>Born in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1823, Hicks moved to Mississippi in the 1840s. He began practicing law in Jefferson County and soon became active in local Democratic politics. He was elected district attorney in 1849 and served in that role into the early 1850s. During the late 1850s, he operated a law firm in Fayette, Mississippi. During the Civil War, Hicks served in the Mississippi legislature, and he remained in office until 1866 when he resigned for unspecified reasons.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS99295P2'>Hicks was charged with embezzlement in 1872, but it is unclear if he was convicted. He remained out of the public eye for several years, before he temporarily ran for the state legislature on an independent ticket in 1877, but dropped his campaign before the general election. He died on January 23, 1885. Hicks was married to Elixabeth Stowers and had at least seven children. He is buried in Darden Cemetery in Fayette, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99399P0'>Plantations are farms that typically grow cash crops, and often specialize in a single product, such as cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane. Plantation farming continues in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century, especially for crops like coffee beans, rubber trees, and cocoa. In American history the term plantation is most often associated with estates in the American south. Historical descriptions of plantations generate images of large farming operations. However, even moderately-sized southern farms that planted cash crops were sometimes referred to as plantations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P1'>Southern plantations before the Civil War were strongly tied to the institution of slavery. As profit-driven agricultural operations, plantations required large numbers of laborers. This fed the demand for African slave importation to the British colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and bolstered the defense of slavery among southern planters in the nineteenth century. Plantation crops varied by region within the south, with rice being popular in Georgia and South Carolina along the Atlantic coast, tobacco being an early cash crop in Virginia, and then—after the invention of the cotton gin at the end of the eighteenth century which quickly separated seeds from the cotton fibers—the boom in cotton growing across the Deep South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P2'>By 1860, there were approximately 46,200 plantations across the south. More than 20,000 had twenty to thirty slaves. Only about 2,300, or five percent, had one hundred or more slaves. The enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work. The plantations were their home. The same was not always true for the plantation owners. The very large operations frequently had wealthy absentee owners, who resided in cities or other states, leaving plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers. Slave cabins, or slave quarters, were a ubiquitous part of a plantation. They represented the heart of the laborers’ community on the property, but were usually of basic construction and few amenities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P3'>Following the abolition of slavery after the Civil War, many freed people continued to live on plantations. Sharecropping became a popular arrangement between the landowners and the laborers. The property was often divided into plots with tenants assigned to certain sections. The system involved a contract or arrangement which allowed the laborer, or tenant, to keep a portion of the crop they raised. The system was abused, and developed a negative reputation for the level of poverty many sharecroppers (mostly Black, but some white) experienced on plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Representatives of the Freedmen’s Bureau sought to protect Black sharecroppers by regulating contracts during Reconstruction, but the withdrawal of federal officials after 1876 left many African American tenants more subject to unfair sharecropping contracts on the old plantations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P0'>By 1862 the initial waves of men who enlisted into Confederate military service diminished as enthusiasm for the war diminished, and both the Union and Confederacy enacted drafts to fill their armies. Nearly one year before the Union (March 1863), the Confederacy instituted a national draft in April 1862. There were important social implications to this policy, especially within the exemptions the Union and Confederacy provided. Similar to the Union, the Confederate act allowed drafted men to hire substitutes to serve in their place (often lower-class men willing to serve for much-needed income) and excused men from military service for medical reasons, "workers deemed necessary to maintain society," including select government employees. And unlike the Union, beginning in October 1862, men who enslaved a minimum of twenty (later fifteen) people were exempt.

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P1'>The Twenty-Slave Law exemption was a reaction to President Abraham Lincoln's recent announcement of the<lb/>
Emancipation Proclamation. While many southern whites worried about enslaved people uprising with so many white men away at war, these policies cultivated a feeling among impoverished people that they were doing the majority of fighting and suffering for a “rich man's war.” Scholars like Joseph Glathaar proved this was not the case in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia where the wealthy were overrepresented compared with impoverished soldiers, but it is unclear if this was the case in areas like Mississippi, and the perception of unfair protections for the wealthy fueled resentment. (William Marvel, "A Poor Man's Fight," National Park Service)
