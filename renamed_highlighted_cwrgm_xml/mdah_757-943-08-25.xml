                    <p xml:id='OTPS86445P0'>Braxton Bragg was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P1'>Born on March 22, 1817, in Warrenton, North Carolina, Bragg attended the prestigious Warrenton Male Academy as a young teenager and then entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, at the age of 16. He performed well at the academy, reportedly due to an exceptional memory and good discipline, and graduated in 1837. His first military assignment was in Florida during the Second Seminole War, but he served as a commissary officer and adjutant, seeing no combat. He later commanded a company of the Third United States Artillery and was stationed at St. Augustine, Florida, and then Fort Moultrie outside of Charleston, South Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P2'>During his first few years of service, Bragg quarreled with other officers and proved outspoken. He wrote a series of essays in the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Literary Messenger</hi> criticizing army leadership. For this he was court martialed upon charges of disobedience and received an official reprimand and temporary suspension of rank. Despite this punishment, Bragg continued to be argumentative. This trait, along with his propensity for strict discipline and obedience to regulations, made him unpopular and the target of stories and rumors among fellow officers. In his memoirs, Ulysses S. Grant, who knew Bragg at West Point and in the Army in the 1840s, recalled hearing of an incident in which Bragg served as a company commander at an Army post, and was made acting quartermaster while his another officer was on detached duty. As company commander, Bragg submitted a formal request for supplies from the quartermaster’s office. As acting quartermaster, he rejected his own request, with a written note on the order explaining his reasons. Bragg, in his role as company commander, protested that his supply request was appropriate, to which he, as acting quartermaster, again rejected the request a second time. Bragg then elevated the matter to the post commander, who reportedly exclaimed, “My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled [<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>] with every officer in the army, and now you are quarrelling with yourself!” While possibly apocryphal, the story reflected Bragg’s reputation among his army colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P3'>Bragg’s performance during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, boosted his army career and reputation. He earned repeated promotions for bravery. His obsession with discipline served the American army well, as his troops were among the best trained on the battlefield. He was brevetted (honorarily promoted) to captain after the Battle of Fort Brown in May 1846, brevetted to major after the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846, and then again to lieutenant colonel after Buena Vista in February 1847. His actions at Buena Vista were especially celebrated, as Bragg positioned his artillery at a key gap in the American line and repulsed a larger Mexican force. Among those who admired Bragg’s actions during the battle was Jefferson Davis, who commanded a Mississippi regiment, but later became secretary of war for the United States and then president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P4'>In 1849, Bragg married Eliza Brooks Ellis, the daughter of a wealthy sugar planter from Louisiana. She followed Bragg to his next military assignments, but by 1855 the couple chose to pursue a life outside of the army. Bragg resigned from the army in 1856 and he and his wife purchased a massive sugar plantation in Louisiana. He managed the sugar cultivation and production with the same adherence to discipline, overseeing more than one hundred slaves on the property. He became active in Louisiana affairs, receiving an appointment as colonel in the Louisiana militia. Bragg initially opposed talk of secession in the south, but followed Louisiana into the Confederacy. He received a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate army in March 1861 and was promoted to major general in September 1861. His first assignment involved commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida. Later, he was transferred to the Army of Mississippi where he commanded a corps under Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P5'>Bragg’s first major engagement during the Civil War was Shiloh, Tennessee, in April 1862. Although Confederate forces were forced to retreat, Bragg performed well at the battle and received a promotion to full general in the Confederacy Army only a week afterwards. He was given command of the Army of Mississippi, renamed the Army of Tennessee. His performance as an army commander afterwards in 1862 and 1863 had mixed results. At battles like Murfreesboro and Chickamauga, Bragg scored early tactical victories but failed to defeat his Union opponents. His brash personality and quarrelsome behavior aggravated subordinates, who called for his removal. However Jefferson Davis remained committed to Bragg and kept him in command of Confederate troops in Tennessee until November 1863, when Bragg offered his resignation following the Confederate defeat at Chattanooga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P6'>Even without a field command, Bragg remained a powerful military figure in the Confederacy. He served as an advisor to Davis and proved an able administrator for the Confederate prison system and medical system. In late 1864, he temporarily commanded Confederate troops in the Carolinas and Georgia coastline. Initially successful, a Union victory at Wilmington, North Carolina, in early 1865 undermined his standing, and he spent the final months commanding a corps commander under Joseph E. Johnston. He surrendered to Union forces in early May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P7'>Bragg’s sugar plantation had been confiscated by federal troops during the Civil War, leaving Bragg and his wife homeless at the end of the war. The couple briefly lived in Alabama, but moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1867 where Bragg became superintendent of the New Orleans waterworks. When he lost his job to a Republican appointee, Bragg received an offer from former Confederate president Jefferson Davis to work for the Carolina Life Insurance Company. He left the job after a few months and undertook a series of other positions with public works and railroad companies in Alabama and Texas, many lasting only a few months before he resigned following disagreements with other executives.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86445P8'>Bragg died suddenly on September 27, 1876, in Galveston, Texas, possibly from a stroke or aneurism. He was 59 years old. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99399P0'>Plantations are farms that typically grow cash crops, and often specialize in a single product, such as cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane. Plantation farming continues in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century, especially for crops like coffee beans, rubber trees, and cocoa. In American history the term plantation is most often associated with estates in the American south. Historical descriptions of plantations generate images of large farming operations. However, even moderately-sized southern farms that planted cash crops were sometimes referred to as plantations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P1'>Southern plantations before the Civil War were strongly tied to the institution of slavery. As profit-driven agricultural operations, plantations required large numbers of laborers. This fed the demand for African slave importation to the British colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and bolstered the defense of slavery among southern planters in the nineteenth century. Plantation crops varied by region within the south, with rice being popular in Georgia and South Carolina along the Atlantic coast, tobacco being an early cash crop in Virginia, and then—after the invention of the cotton gin at the end of the eighteenth century which quickly separated seeds from the cotton fibers—the boom in cotton growing across the Deep South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P2'>By 1860, there were approximately 46,200 plantations across the south. More than 20,000 had twenty to thirty slaves. Only about 2,300, or five percent, had one hundred or more slaves. The enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work. The plantations were their home. The same was not always true for the plantation owners. The very large operations frequently had wealthy absentee owners, who resided in cities or other states, leaving plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers. Slave cabins, or slave quarters, were a ubiquitous part of a plantation. They represented the heart of the laborers’ community on the property, but were usually of basic construction and few amenities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P3'>Following the abolition of slavery after the Civil War, many freed people continued to live on plantations. Sharecropping became a popular arrangement between the landowners and the laborers. The property was often divided into plots with tenants assigned to certain sections. The system involved a contract or arrangement which allowed the laborer, or tenant, to keep a portion of the crop they raised. The system was abused, and developed a negative reputation for the level of poverty many sharecroppers (mostly Black, but some white) experienced on plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Representatives of the Freedmen’s Bureau sought to protect Black sharecroppers by regulating contracts during Reconstruction, but the withdrawal of federal officials after 1876 left many African American tenants more subject to unfair sharecropping contracts on the old plantations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P0'>The act of beginning to fight or a period of time in a war, military engagements are also referred to as battles or skirmishes. Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P1'>There were approximately 10,500 engagements during the American Civil War. Fifty of them were major battles, while another one hundred were notable engagements. The rest were small battles or skirmishes. (Cambridge Dictionary; American Battlefield Trust)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD104719P0'>The Battle of Shiloh (also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing) was fought on April 6 – 7, 1862 in Hardin County, Tennessee between the Army of the Tennessee (Union) commanded by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant against the Army of Mississippi (Confederate) commanded by Gen. Sidney Albert Johnston, and later, by Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard. It resulted in a Union victory. After the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson in February of 1862, Johnston withdrew Confederate forces from Kentucky and central and western Tennessee, opening Mississippi and Alabama to attack from the Union Army. Johnston suspected that Grant would attack Corinth, Mississippi, the hub of the Ohio and Mobile and Memphis and Charleston railroads, an important Confederate supply route. He gathered his forces at Corinth and marched north to Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee to attack Grant before Union reinforcements could arrive.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD104719P1'>Fighting began on the morning of April 6. Initially, Johnston’s forces had the element of surprise, attacking Union soldiers at their camp and driving them back toward Pittsburgh Landing. Union forces regrouped and counter-attacked. That afternoon, Johnston was shot in his knee, the ball severing an artery and killing him from blood loss. Command fell to Beauregard who believed his forces were victorious and ordered the attack halted as darkness fell that evening. Grant, receiving reinforcements overnight, launched an attack on the morning of April 7. Beauregard counter-attacked, but the two sides reached a stalemate. That afternoon Beauregard realized that Grant was reinforced, and he was outnumbered. He retreated with his forces to Corinth. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 110,053; 65,085 Union and 44,968 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 23,746 with 13,047 Union and 10,669 Confederate. The Confederate defeat at Shiloh gave the Union access to several hundred miles of the Mississippi River to launch operations further into to South. Also of note, Sidney Albert Johnston would be the highest-ranking Confederate general killed in the war (American Battlefield Trust; Tennessee Encyclopedia; Encyclopedia Britannica)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25010254P0'>The Battle of Stones River (also known as the Second Battle of Murfreesboro) was fought from December 31, 1862 to January 2, 1863 near Murfreesboro, Rutherford County, Tennessee between the Army of the Cumberland (Union) commanded by Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans and the Army of Tennessee (Confederate) commanded by Gen. Braxton Bragg. The battle was a part of the Stones River Campaign and resulted in a Union victory. Rosecrans’ forces left Nashville on December 26 and marched south to meet Bragg’s army at Murfreesboro. On December 30 both sides took up positions on the banks of the Stones River. Each commander devised a similar battle plan; attack the enemy’s right flank and move in behind to cut them off from their communication and supply lines. Early on the morning of December 31 the Confederates seized the initiative and launched an attack on the Union right flank, shattering it and forcing it back approximately two miles. By the evening, Bragg had Rosecrans’ forces cornered at the Stones River. On January 1 both sides repositioned their forces. Rosecrans sent troops eastward across the Stones River to extend his line along a defensible hilltop. On the afternoon of January 2, the Confederates launched an attack on this position and were forced back by Union artillery. After suffering heavy casualties from the Union artillery and subsequent counterattack, Bragg withdrew his forces on January 3. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 76,400; 41,400 Union and 35,000 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 24,645 with 12,906 Union and 11,739 Confederate. Rosecrans’ costly victory at Stones River put the Union in control of central Tennessee and denied the Confederates the rich farms around Chattanooga needed to provide food for the war effort.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
