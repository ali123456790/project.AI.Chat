                    <p xml:id='OTPS75605P0'>Otho Robards Singleton was a Mississippi politician during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75605P1'>Born on October 14, 1814, near Nicholasville, Kentucky, graduated from St. Joseph College in Kentucky and then received a law degree from the University of Lexington. He moved to Mississippi and became a practicing attorney in 1838. Shortly after establishing his law practice, Singleton became involved in state politics. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1846 and then won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1848, serving until 1854.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75605P2'>Singleton’s political career continued to rise, and in 1854 he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. While he lost reelection after his first term, he regained a congressional seat in 1857 and served in the U.S. Congress until Mississippi declared its secession from the Union in January 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. Singleton resigned his seat and returned to Mississippi. He immediately ran for, and won, a seat in the Confederate Congress, serving through the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS75605P3'>After the Civil War, Singleton did not hold notable public office until near the end of Reconstruction, winning a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives from Mississippi in 1875. He won reelection several times, serving until 1887. Singleton died two years later, on January 11, 1889. He was married twice, first to Martha Field, who passed away in 1856. His second wife was Eliza Yandell, who also preceded him in death. Singleton had at least five children. He is buried in Canton City Cemetery in Canton, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52203P0'>James H. Rives was a Confederate soldier and the Mississippi governor’s private secretary during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52203P1'>Born in 1830 in Georgia, Rives moved to Noxubee County, Mississippi, as a young man and became a practicing attorney. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Rives volunteered for military service, and was commissioned as an officer in a militia company named the Noxubee Rifles. He received a commission in the Confederate army when the company was incorporated into the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment as Company F.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52203P2'>By late 1862, Rives had left the regiment and accepted an appointment as private secretary to Mississippi governor John J. Pettus. He served in that role for most of 1863. After the war, Rives returned to Noxubee County and practiced law. He married Leona Cotton in 1868 and had at least one daughter. Rives was active in Noxubee County politics in the late 1860s and early 1870s, and was called before the U.S. Congress to testify to about race relations in Mississippi in 1871. He died in 1875.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56587P0'>James Alexander Seddon was an American congressman and then Secretary of State of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P1'>Born near Fredericksburg, Virginia, on July 13, 1815, Seddon grew up in Virginia and graduated from the University of Virginia’s law school. After working as an attorney for several years, Seddon entered politics, winning election as a Democrat to the U. S. House of Representatives in 1845. He declined to run for reelection due to a disagreement with the Democratic platform, but returned to Congress in 1849. In 1851, Seddon left public office, citing poor health, and resided in a plantation along the James River, near Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P2'>Seddon became active in politics again in 1861, during the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. He attended a peace conference in Washington, D.C., in February 1861, which brought together representatives from the upper southern states who wished to avoid a war over secession. However, after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina, and President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down secessionist defiance of federal authority, Virginia seceded. Seddon backed the Confederate cause and served in the Confederate Congress as a representative of Virginia. In 1862, he received an appointment by Confederate president Jefferson Davis to serve as Secretary of State for the Confederacy—the fourth man to hold the position, and ultimately being the longest serving.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P3'>Seddon remained secretary until January 1, 1865, then retired and returned to his home. Union soldiers arrested him in May 1865; he spent several months in prison before being released. Seddon remained out of public life following the Civil War, dying on August 19, 1880, at the age of 65. He was married to Sarah Bruce, and had nine children. Seddon is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the first military drafts occurred during the American Civil War, in which both the Union and Confederate governments issued conscription laws.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P1'>The Confederacy, receiving fewer enlistments than it expected at the beginning of the war, passed the First Conscription Act in April 1862, rendering all able-bodied white males between the ages of 18 and 35 eligible to be compelled into military service, but it included a provision by which a draftee could hire a substitute or obtain an exemption. Fearing insurrections by the enslaved population, the Confederacy passed a Second Conscription Act in September 1862 exempting one white enslaver for every twenty enslaved persons on a property, also known as the "Twenty Slave Law". Both the substitute and twenty slave laws isolated impoverished white southerners and rendered the draft deeply unpopular among non-elite southerners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P2'>In the North, conscription began in July 1862 when Congress authorized the president to enlist any militia company into the United States' service. Conscription extended to the general public in March 1863 with the Enrollment Act, rendering any able-bodied white male citizen or immigrant between the ages of 20 and 45 subject to the draft. This law similarly included a provision allowing one to purchase a substitute or commutation for the then-sizeable fee of $300. Draftees could also be exempt by proving that they were the sole support of family members or other dependents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P3'>Many individuals in the North and South saw their respective drafts as affronts to the freedom and individual liberties upon which the United States was founded, while tensions also arose between those of different races, ethnicities, religions, and social classes that were differently represented in the draft. The draft also brought home the realities of war to many families, North and South, who relied on men to support them, as fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers were sent to fight, where they would make the little money paid to soldiers and possibly lose their lives. Conscription in the American Civil War led to the violence of the New York Draft Riots of July 1863, and resulted in widespread and varied resistance in North and South (Bill of Rights Institute).
