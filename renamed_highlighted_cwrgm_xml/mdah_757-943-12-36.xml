                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS54036P0'>Nathan Bedford Forrest was a Confederate cavalry commander and later the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P1'>Born on July 13, 1821, in Bedford County, Tennessee, he became his family’s caretaker at age sixteen when his father died. He pursued numerous types of business as a young man, including gambling, farming, and slave trading. When the Civil War began in 1861, Forrest was one of the wealthiest men in the south, owning more than three thousand acres in Mississippi, as well as plantations in Tennessee and Arkansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P2'>He volunteered for Confederate service in 1861 and soon received command of the Third Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. He had no formal military training—and little formal education—yet, proved a natural leader and military tactician. He scored numerous military victories as a cavalry commander, and showed skill in avoiding capture or defeat by Union troops. In February 1862, when Ulysses S. Grant’s troops besieged Confederate troops at Fort Donelson, Forrest led nearly four thousand southern soldiers in escaping across the Cumberland River before the fort fell to the federal units. During the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi in 1863, Forrest was a brigadier general leading Confederate raids on Grant’s supply lines, causing havoc and frustrating federal efforts to stop his cavalry force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P3'>By 1864, Forrest had been promoted to major general. He continued to see great success in raids behind Union lines and through mounting attacks against smaller contingents of Union soldiers. In April 1864, he led Confederate troops against a federal garrison at Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Forrest’s men overran the fort and, according to many witness accounts, began murdering Black Union soldiers who had surrendered to the Confederates. The event became one of the most famous atrocities of the Civil War, widely publicized and investigated by federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P4'>While much of the Confederacy’s military future grew dim in 1864, as William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army advanced upon Atlanta, and Grant’s Union forces backed Robert E. Lee into a defensive position around Richmond, Virginia, Forrest remained mobile and dangerous, scoring notable victories even when outnumbered, such as the Battle of Brice’s Cross Roads in June 1864 in Mississippi. He was promoted to lieutenant general in February 1865, and remained in the field until April 1865, when he surrendered to Union forces in the wake of the Confederacy’s collapse. By the time the Civil War ended, Forrest had been wounded four times, reportedly had twenty-nine horses shot out from under him, and claimed to have killed or defeated thirty Union soldiers in hand-to-hand combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P5'>Following the war, Forrest lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and pursued a career in railroad development. His ventures ultimately were not successful, and he was nearly bankrupt. He moved onto a large plantation on the Mississippi River that used convicts for labor, in a system similar to slavery. Apart from his financial efforts, Forrest’s early postwar activities involved a prominent role in the Ku Klux Klan. Elected the terror organization’s first Grand Wizard in 1867. He helped recruit former Confederates and white southern men to the group as an effort to resist Reconstruction and Republican policies. However, Forrest became disenchanted with the lack of order and discipline he saw during the Klan’s its rapid expansion. In 1869, he tried to dissolve the Klan and ordered its members to destroy their robes and hoods. By the mid-1870s, Forrest began making public speeches advocating for better protection of Black civil rights. These actions caused rebuke from many of his former Confederate colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P6'>Forrest died of diabetes October 29, 1877. He was married to Mary Ann Montgomery and had two children. Forrest was initially buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Then, in 1904, city officials moved his remains (and those of his wife) to a city park named in his honor. In 2021, his remains were moved again, this time to Columbia, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

</p>

<p corresp='TTP25092177P3' xml:id='OTP25092177P3'>I am aware that our County has suffered much in the good opinion of the people of the State, caused by slanderous reports from various persons. I do not now propose to defend them, but will simply say, that we have been overrun by the <rs ref='#S71916'>Federal Army</rs>, our <rs ref='#S63099'>Negroes</rs> driven away, our stock killed, <rs ref='#S91669'>houses burned</rs>, and every injury and indig=nity offered, which could be concieved, and executed by a barberous and unfeeling foe—
</p>

<p corresp='TTP25092177P4' xml:id='OTP25092177P4'>A large force of Federals are now trying to pass through the <rs ref='#S63134'>Yazoo Pass</rs>, into <rs ref='#S103258'>Cold Water</rs> &amp; <rs ref='#S25012379'>Talehatchy River</rs>, to lay in ashes the Country through which they may go. For myself I claim nothing, for I have nothing left to be protected, having been robed of every negro, mule, horse, hog &amp; cow, or nearly all of my stock, but there are other parties, whose <rs ref='#S25013472'>family</rs> &amp; property remain here, who have been in the service since the war began, who are entitled to some little protection. We have here, resisting this Federal movement Capt <rs ref='#S54036'>Forest</rs> &amp; 40 men, Upon the successful resistance of their movements the entire state, is involved, for nothing can stop them, if they once reach Coldwater River, from destroying all the property on the Talahatchie &amp; Yazoo Rivers. One thousand men can prevent them from going through the Pass, They are skirmishing now in sight of my house, and if they succeed in driving away from the banks of the Pass, the few men Forest has, the Fleet will certainly go down, There are two GunBoats &amp; 6 Transports
