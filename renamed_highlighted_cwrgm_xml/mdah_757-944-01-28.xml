                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS96449P0'>Robert Spencer Hudson was an attorney and judge in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS96449P1'>Born on August 17, 1820, in Edgefield District, South Carolina, Hudson moved to Mississippi as a young man and became a leading legal figure in the state. He served as a district attorney and was a circuit judge in Mississippi during the Civil War. After the war, Hudson was prominent in efforts to restrict legal rights for African Americans, participating in Mississippi’s constitutional convention in 1865 and chairing the committee in that convention that outlined the highly discriminatory laws later known as the Black Codes. He briefly served in the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1875 and was chairman of the Committee on Impeachment during the Democratic effort to expel Republican Governor Adelbert Ames from office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS96449P2'>Hudson died on May 29, 1889, at the age of 68. He was married to Nancy Elvira Gray and had at least seven children that survived to adulthood. Hudson is buried in Glenwood Cemetery in Yazoo City, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

<p corresp='TTP25105199P3' xml:id='OTP25105199P3'>D<add place='above'>r</add> Sir, A young man from <rs ref='#S63020'>Louisiana</rs> has just reached my neighborhood and represents upon his person-al knowledge that the <rs ref='#S71916'>enemy</rs> are digging another cannal at some point on the <rs ref='#S63143'>river</rs> above <rs ref='#S51788'>Vicksburg</rs> to connect the River with a Lake that connects with other Lakes and through them with <rs ref='#S25018773'>Red River</rs>. That this cannal will be only a half or three fourths of a mile long to perform its office—I have not seen this young man, but he is vouched for as alto-gether truthful, and that he makes this statement is also reliable—I have seen no notice of this [page torn] ted in the <rs ref='#S99620'>papers</rs>, and therefore suppose it is not [page torn] generally and perhaps not to our military authori-ties—hence I write you on the subject—Last summer an old Steam Boat Captain, whose name I have for-gotten told <rs ref='#S25015814'>Robt Shotwell</rs> and myself on the cars [page torn] <rs ref='#S63302'>Canton</rs> that he could run his Boat from <rs ref='#S72536'>Berwicks Bay</rs> within 25 miles of Vicksburg through the Lakes Red River &amp;c without touching the Miss, R. It may that this last effort of the enemy is feasable—Cannot those Lakes be obstructed by falling timber from each bank, forming a V, up stream? They are said to be narrow in places and heavily skirted with huge timber or trees—If our people could begin at the mouth of this chain of Lakes on Red River, and by falling timber in all the narrow places, so as to form a V or Rafter up stream and thereby prevent them from washing away or being forced I should regard it as good policy. I hope my suggestion is no intrusion and that it is the right one.
