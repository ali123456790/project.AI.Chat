                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD51118P0'>In April 1862, the Confederate government passed its First Conscription Act which made all white men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to compulsory military service for up to three years. Subsequent acts, passed in September 1862 and February 1864, expanded the individuals liable to conscription and length of service. To oversee conscription activities within the Confederacy, the government established the Bureau of Conscription under the Adjutant and Inspector General’s Department in December 1862. The office operated only east of the Mississippi River (conscription activities west of the river were handled by other officials who reported directly to the commanding general of the Trans-Mississippi Department). The bureau faced opposition from some military commanders, including Brigadier General Gideon J. Pillow who took on military authority over conscription efforts in January 1863 in General Joseph E. Johnston’s military department over Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The dispute between civil and military conscription authorities, both claiming hegemony over conscription duties and acting independently from each other, aggravated many southerners already opposed to the prospect of compulsory military service. Additionally, Pillow’s conscription agents used the threat of conscription as a shaming device to generate volunteer enlistments, further tarnishing public attitudes toward the draft. By the time Pillow’s conscription authorities were removed in December 1863 and the Bureau of Conscription resumed full control over the draft in that region, opposition to conscription had reached new heights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD51118P1'>Beyond drawing men from civilian life into military service, the Bureau of Conscription engaged in arresting deserters and returning them to military service. These activities required a large administrative structure, and by early 1864, more than 2,800 people worked for the bureau. By February 1865, bureau officials reported that the organization had drafted nearly 82,000 men into Confederate service. Additionally, officials claimed to have returned more than 33,000 deserters to service. The accounting report also listed several other matters tracked or managed by the bureau. For instance, 76,000 men had joined the Confederacy without being drafted, more than 66,000 men had been exempted from conscription, and around 20,000 had been detailed for agricultural or specialized work projects.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD51118P2'>The Confederate government abolished the Bureau of Conscription in March 1865. Conscription and enlistment duties for the Confederacy fell onto the shoulders of generals commanding the reserves in the various southern states. (William L. Shaw, “The Confederate Conscription and Exemption Acts,” <hi rend='italic'>The American Journal of Legal History</hi>, 385–389; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32099655P0'>During the nineteenth century, Mississippi operated a sporadic hospital system, which was primarily focused on creating state institutions to provide mental health care for people imprisoned in the state's penitentiary in Jackson and the Mississippi State Hospital, which operated in Jackson from 1855 to 1926 when it was moved to Rankin County. Otherwise medical and mental health care was typically handled locally, especially for enslaved people on plantations. ("Whitfield (Mississippi State Hospital)," Mississippi Encyclopedia) Here, you can find references to hospital care in Mississippi where the name of the hospital is unknown.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD105689P0'>Founded in 1848, the Mississippi State Hospital was a state-funded institution in Jackson, Mississippi, for people suffering from psychological disorders. First proposed by Governor Albert Gallatin Brown in 1846, the initial facility was constructed on a five-acre lot with funds provided by the state legislature. Shortly afterwards, the hospital’s commissioners constructed a larger facility north of Jackson (currently the campus of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson) with guidance and support from noted humanitarian Dorothea L. Dix, who personally appealed to Mississippi legislators for better mental health treatment. (Before the nineteenth century, people with psychiatric problems were often ignored, abandoned, or jailed as public nuisances.) Named the Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum, the four-story hospital began taking patients in 1855. Originally intended for white patients, the hospital’s administrators and board of trustees began admitting a small number of African Americans—free and slave—for treatment in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P1'>The state hospital housed and treated thousands of mental health patients (often referred to as lunatics in the vernacular of the nineteenth century). The number of patients rose from 70 in 1855 to nearly 500 by 1890. Most people admitted for treatment in the 1850s were women in their 20’s and 30’s, sent by family members for causes listed as “unlucky in business,” “disappointed in love,” and “feeblemindedness.” Patients were also placed into the state hospital for behavior associated to menstruation, overactive sexual interests or activities, drug or alcohol use, and other behaviors deemed socially or religiously inappropriate. Not all patients were admitted at the behest of family members, as local citizens could file complaints against neighbors or other residents, prompting their local sheriff to detain the suspected “lunatic” and present them to a county probate court for a jury to decide if admission to the asylum was necessary.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P2'>The facility and its care for psychological disorders were considered advanced for the mid-nineteenth century and many patients were employed in jobs, such as carpentry, farming, manufacturing, and other laboring tasks on the hospital grounds. However, some treatments for psychological disorders in that era included mechanical restraints, physical punishment, and isolation. As many as 7,000 patients died at the state hospital site at Jackson between 1855 and its 1935, when the Mississippi government closed the state hospital at Jackson and opened a new facility at a different location. Some deaths were due to poorly understood sanitation or disease problems, such as tainted water supplies, as well as yellow fever and malaria epidemics, but many other deaths occurred due to the patients remaining at the facility until they died of natural causes. The hospital was seen as a permanent residence for those deemed “incurable.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P3'>During the Civil War, Union soldiers temporarily occupied the state hospital when they captured Jackson. The troops confiscated property from the facility, including killing livestock held on the hospital grounds. However, the hospital remained active during the war, and was improved in 1870 with the appointment of Dr. William Compton as superintendent. He lobbied for better funds and treatment for patients, particularly for African Americans, although the facility was segregated by race and gender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P4'>The state hospital continued to expand and treat a growing number of patients well into the twentieth century. By the mid-1920s it housed 2,000 patients. Due to its deteriorating conditions after decades of operation, the Mississippi legislature constructed a new facility in Rankin County, which opened in 1935. The Mississippi State Hospital at Jackson closed its doors that same year. (Lucius M. Lampton, “Whitfield (Mississippi State Hospital),” Mississippi Encyclopedia; Sudhakar Madakasira, “History of Mississippi Psychiatry: A Dark Past Unearthed on UMMC Grounds,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of the Mississippi Psychiatric Association</hi>)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
