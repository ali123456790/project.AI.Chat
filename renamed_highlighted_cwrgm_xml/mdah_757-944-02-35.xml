                    <p xml:id='OTPS97207P0'>John C. Pemberton was a Confederate general, most famous for commanding troops in the unsuccessful defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P1'>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 10, 1814, Pemberton was raised and educated in the north. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837, and immediately afterwards served as a U.S. artillery officer in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He remained a professional soldier for the next two decades, serving at various forts and posts in the United States, along the Canadian border, and in the west. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Pemberton served with the 4th U.S. Artillery and took part in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de La Palma, and Monterrey. He earned the brevet (honorary) rank of captain for his actions at Monterrey. He continued to serve with distinction at several other engagements in Mexico, including the storming of Chapultepec castle and the battle at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P2'>In 1848, following the Mexican-American War, Pemberton married Martha Thompson of Virginia. The couple had one daughter and three sons, all born in the 1850s. Pemberton continued to serve at a variety of posts in the United States, and saw additional action in Florida against the Seminoles from 1849 to 1850, and then again from 1856 to 1857. After spending a year in New Mexico Territory and three years in Minnesota, Pemberton was sent to Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1861, in the midst of the secession crisis. Despite his northern upbringing, Pemberton resigned his commission from the United States Army when the Civil War erupted in April 1861. He immediately volunteered for Confederate service and received an appointment as assistant adjutant general of Confederate forces at Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P3'>Because of his lengthy military experience, Pemberton rose quickly in Confederate ranks, reaching major general in January 1862. He was placed in command of the military department defending Georgia and South Carolina, but soon ran into conflict with the states’ governors who objected to Pemberton's assertion that the survival of his army was more important than defending the region, and due to mistrust of his northern heritage. Confederate President Jefferson Davis placed the more popular General P. G. T. Beauregard in charge of the defense of Georgia and South Carolina and relocated Pemberton to a new military department in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P4'>At his new assignment in Mississippi, in the fall of 1862, Pemberton received the promotion to lieutenant general. He was responsible for defending the Mississippi River and key port towns, such as Vicksburg, from federal attack. Unlike the more famous Confederate armies to the east, Pemberton’s command was made up of southern troops who had suffered several defeats against aggressive Union commanders at battles like Shiloh and Corinth. Many of Pemberton’s troops were separated, and he struggled to unite his force to stage an effective defense against Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army, which began a campaign for Vicksburg in December 1862. Making matters worse for the Confederate general, his orders were to hold Vicksburg at all cost—meaning that he had limited ability to maneuver or even withdraw to save his army in the face of Grant’s larger force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P5'>Between December 1862 and July 1863, Grant conducted a slow, creative, but ultimately persistent campaign to surround and capture Vicksburg. Utilizing his aggressive subordinate William T. Sherman, Grant cut Pemberton and his Confederate troops off at Vicksburg and burned Mississippi’s capital of Jackson in May 1863. After being besieged in Vicksburg by Grant’s troops for six weeks, Pemberton realized he had no other choice but to surrender. On July 4, 1863, Pemberton ordered his army to lay down its arms and open Vicksburg to Grant’s army. The defeat occurred one day after Robert E. Lee’s battlefield loss at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, delivering a double blow to Confederate morale.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P6'>Pemberton and his men were captured and paroled by Union forces—a practice by which prisoners were allowed to return home or to encampments under the sworn oath not to take up arms until formally exchanged for Union prisoners. Pemberton traveled to Richmond where he remained idle for several months. Not receiving a new assignment, he resigned his general’s commission in May 1864. President Davis offered him a conciliatory assignment as a lieutenant colonel of artillery, which he accepted. He temporarily commanded the artillery defense of Richmond before taking an appointment as inspector general of artillery. Pemberton was captured by Union troops in mid-April 1865 during the final days of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P7'>Following the Civil War, Pemberton moved to Warrenton, Virginia. He remained there until 1876, when he moved back to Pennsylvania. He lived quietly on a farm, passing away in 1881. Pemberton is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52619P0'>William H. McCardle was a writer and newspaper editor famous for his challenges to Reconstruction policies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P1'>Born on June 1, 1815, in Maysville, Kentucky, McCardle established himself as a newspaper editor in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1839 when he became part owner of the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg Daily Whig</hi>, Mississippi’s first daily newspaper. He sold that newspaper three years later, in 1842, but continued to be heavily involved in journalism, including owning the <hi rend='italic'>Weekly True Southron</hi> in the late 1850s. McCardle served as a Confederate officer during the Civil War—and was frequently referred to as colonel or general late in life—but he came to greater fame after the Civil War as an outspoken critic of Republican Reconstruction. On November 1, 1867, federal military authorities arrested McCardle for publishing highly critical articles against U.S. officials in the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg Herald</hi> and charged him with four crimes under the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867: disturbing the peace, inciting insurrection, libel, and impeding reconstruction. He petitioned the civilian court for habeas corpus (a challenge over his confinement), but the United States District Court for Mississippi deferred to the military tribunal. McCardle then appealed his case to the United States Supreme Court.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P2'>The Supreme Court heard McCardle’s case, but before the justices rendered a decision the U.S. Congress rejected the Court’s jurisdiction over the case, according to Article III, Second 2 of the U.S. Constitution. McCardle remained imprisoned for three years, before military authorities released him without ever holding a trial.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P3'>Late in life McCardle co-authored a comprehensive history Mississippi with former governor Robert Lowry. He died on April 28, 1893, at the age of 77, in Jackson, Mississippi. McCardle was married twice, first to Emily Caroline Byrnes, with whom he had five children. Emily passed away in 1852. In 1868 he married Ann Eliza Sharp and had three more children. McCardle is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

<p xml:id='OTPS101737P1'>Born on December 29, 1834, in Virginia, Waddy graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1853 and commissioned as a lieutenant in the Fourth U.S. Artillery Regiment. He served at various outposts, including in Kansas Territory during the late 1850s. When the Civil War broke out in 1861 and his home state of Virginia declared itself seceded from the Union, Waddy resigned his commission and volunteered for Confederate service. He was commissioned as an officer in the Confederate Army and spent much of the war as an adjutant general. He also served as an ordnance and artillery officer, and was a colonel in command of artillery units within Joseph E. Johnston’s army when it surrendered to Union forces in North Carolina in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101737P2'>Waddy returned to Virginia after being pardoned by federal officials, but relocated to New York City and lived there for most of the Reconstruction period. He moved back to Virginia in 1877 and worked as inspector-in-chief of grain shipments for the Norfolk and Western Railroad Company. Waddy died on February 10, 1903. He was married to Ella Fitchett and had eight children. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25012725P0'>The Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana was established by General Orders, No. 73 issued by the Adjutant and Inspector-General’s Office on October 1, 1862. It was a geographical command of the Confederate Army encompassing the State of Mississippi and the State of Louisiana east of the Mississippi River. It was subdivided into the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Military Districts. Its first commander was Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton who commanded the department from October 1, 1862–December 22, 1863, and Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk later commanded it from December 23, 1863–January 27, 1864. In January 1864 Alabama was merged into the Department and it became known as the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
