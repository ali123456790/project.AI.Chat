                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS104425P0'>Robert Edward Lee was the Confederacy’s most famous general, commanding the primary southern army in the eastern theater from 1862 to 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P1'>Born on January 19, 1807, at Stratford Hall, Virginia, Lee was the son of a famed veteran of the American Revolution. Although his father fell into financial despair and abandoned the family, Lee maintained a good reputation and received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated second in his class in 1829 and shortly afterwards married Mary Anna Randolph Custis, the great-grand daughter of Mary Washington (George Washington’s wife). The couple eventually had seven children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P2'>Lee served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for nearly two decades before serving on the staff of General Winfield Scott during the Mexican-American War in the mid-1840s. He performed very well during the war, receiving three brevet (honorary) promotions (major, lieutenant colonel, and then colonel) for his actions Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. After the war, Lee served at various army posts before receiving an administrative position at West Point. He was the superintendent of the military academy from 1852 to 1855. He then received a field assignment as second-in-command of the Second Cavalry Regiment in Texas, under future Confederate general Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P3'>In 1857, Lee’s father-in-law passed away, leaving Lee and his wife Mary to inherit significant amounts of land—including a large plantation and home in Arlington, Virginia, across the river from Washington, D.C.—hundreds of slaves, and a large debt. Lee took time away from the military to get the properties and finances in order, which involved overseeing the work, discipline, and sale of enslaved laborers. In 1859, while in Virginia, Lee was called to lead military forces against John Brown’s abolitionists who had attacked the U.S. arsenal at Harper’s Ferry as part of an effort to spark a slave rebellion in the south. When Lee arrived, Brown’s group was surrounded in a brick building. When Brown refused orders to surrender, Lee instructed his troops to attack, and they captured Brown and killed or captured his followers within minutes. The event made national news in the already tense political battle between pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests in the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P4'>When southern states began declaring their separation from the Union following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860, Lee initially opposed secession. However, after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in April 1861, prompting Lincoln to call for volunteers to defeat the secessionists, Lee’s home state of Virginia officially joined the Confederacy. Lee was offered high ranking command in the Union, but he declined. He resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for military service within Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P5'>Lee’s first military assignment was command of Confederate troops in modern-day western Virginia. He suffered defeats in small battles there in 1861, but retained his reputation as an able officer and took a position as an advisor to Confederate president Jefferson Davis in Richmond. Then, in the summer of 1862, Lee was placed in command of an army defending the Confederate capital from Union forces, after General Joseph E. Johnston was wounded. Lee’s aggressive attacks prompted the Union army, under cautious commander General George B. McClellan, to withdraw, thereby elevating Lee’s reputation as a savior of the Confederacy. For the rest of the war, Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia were the Confederacy’s most famous and successful military force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P6'>Lee proved to be a creative commander, willing to take risks and attack aggressively to overcome his opponents’ superiority in size. Lee often chose good positions to defend, and then ordered strategic counterattacks to disrupt and defeat Union forces. Among his greatest victories were the Battle of Second Manassas in August 1862 and the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, in which he thoroughly defeated much larger Union armies through surprise flank attacks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P7'>Lee’s military gambles did not always succeed. He conducted only two offensive campaigns during the Civil War—into Maryland in September 1862 and into Pennsylvania in 1863. Both were intended to draw Union forces away from Virginia. He also hoped military victories on battlefields further north would more effectively harm the Union war effort, and possibly draw the border state of Maryland into the Confederacy. However, Lee lost both campaigns after a single major battle (Antietam in Maryland, and Gettysburg in Pennsylvania), in turn invigorating the Union war effort. President Abraham Lincoln used the Union victory of Lee at Antietam in September 1862 to announce his intention to issue an Emancipation Proclamation declaring freedom for all enslaved people within Confederate territories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P8'>By 1864, Lee had abandoned plans for offensive strategic operations. Other than ordering limited and diversionary assaults, he spent the rest of the war using the Army of Northern Virginia to defend Richmond. That spring, Ulysses S. Grant was placed in charge of Union forces in Virginia and began a stubborn advance to capture the Confederate capital. The result was a series of deadly battles in northern Virginia, followed by a lengthy stand off around Petersburg, Virginia. In the spring of 1865, Grant’s forces broke Lee’s defensive line, forcing the Confederates to abandon Richmond and retreat southward. Overwhelmed and cut off by superior numbers, Lee formally surrendered in April 1865 at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. Although not the last Confederate army to surrender, Lee’s capitulation signaled to most people in the north and south that the Confederacy had been defeated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P9'>After the war, Lee returned to Virginia. The U.S. government had confiscated his family home at Arlington and turned it into a war cemetery. Lee’s family sued the federal government and eventually received some financial compensation. The estate is now preserved by the U.S. government as Arlington National Cemetery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P10'>In October 1865, Lee accepted an appointment as president of Washington College (modern-day Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. His fame helped draw money to the school, and he proved to be a very capable administrator. Lee died on October 12, 1870, from complications of a stroke and pneumonia. He is entombed in the University Chapel Museum at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51698P0'>Thomas Jesse Wharton was attorney general of Mississippi during the Civil War and a circuit judge after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P1'>Born on May 18, 1817, in Nashville, Tennessee, Wharton was a good student and graduated from Nashville law school at the age of 19. He moved to Clinton, Mississippi, in 1836 to practice law, but returned to Tennessee the following year, where he married Mary Edgar. The couple had nine children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P2'>Around 1839 Wharton and his wife moved to Raymond, Mississippi. In 1856, he was appointed the state’s attorney general and his family moved to Jackson. He remained in that position for eight years, including during most of the Civil War. During the secession crisis of 1861, Wharton also served as a commissioner to Tennessee, tasked with encouraging his native state to secede and join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P3'>After the Civil War, Wharton returned to law practice. In 1882, after Reconstruction, he was selected judge of the Seventh Judicial District. He held that position until 1886. Wharton died on January 28, 1900. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

You desire my opinion on the question whether he can be ad-mitted into the Penitentiary, in persuance of the sentence of the Court Martial. It is clearly my opinion he could be so recei-ved and confined. Waiving the doubt which may well be enter-tained whether, under our statues, the Peniteniary could be used for the confinement of persons convicted by <hi rend='underline'>Court Marshal</hi>—there can be no doubt that the Court must have held its session in the State of Mississippi. The only Statute on law on the sub-ject is as follows—"It shall be the duty of the respective keeper of each of the County <rs ref='#S62931'>prisons</rs>, and the Superintendant of the Pen-itentiary to receive into the said prison or Penitentiary, any crim-inal convicted of any offence against the United States" (now of the Confederate States) sentenced to imprisonment therein, by any Court of the United States, <hi rend='underline'>within the State</hi>, until such sentence be execu-ted, or until such convict shall be discharged by due course of law" &amp;c
