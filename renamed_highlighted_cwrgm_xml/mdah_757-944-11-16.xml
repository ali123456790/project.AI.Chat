                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52243P0'>Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth president of the United States, whose election to the White House as an anti-slavery Republican in 1860 led several southern states to declare themselves separate from the Union and create the Confederate States of America. Lincoln was commander-in-chief of Union forces during the Civil War. Over the course of four years, Lincoln oversaw the Union war effort and took steps to end the institution of slavery to aid the federal military effort and destroy the root cause of the north versus south sectional conflict.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P1'>Born on February 12, 1809, near Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln moved with is family to Indiana as a child and grew up in a poor, frontier society. Although he received minimal formal education, Lincoln proved to be highly intelligent and a voracious reader. He held various jobs as a young man, including working on a flatboat down the Mississippi River, splitting rails and logs, and as a store keeper. He moved to Illinois in 1830 and in 1832, he volunteered for military service during the Black Hawk War in Illinois. Elected captain of a militia company, Lincoln saw no combat, but credited his time leading men in the military as one of the most proud and instructional periods of his life.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P2'>After the Black Hawk War, Lincoln operated a general store in New Salem, Illinois. When the business began to lose money, he decided to study law and become an attorney. Unlike most other lawyers, who attended a law school or studied under established attorneys, Lincoln’s education was self-guided through legal texts and books he borrowed or purchased. Meanwhile, he developed an interest in politics. After an unsuccessful run for the Illinois legislature in 1833, he ran again in 1834 and won a seat in the state’s House of Representatives. He served one term and became known for his support of internal improvements and his Free Soil position on slavery, which opposed slavery in the new territories and criticized abolition (the immediate, forced end of slavery).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P3'>After leaving the Illinois legislature in 1836, Lincoln became a successful attorney in Springfield. He handled many different types of cases, and over the course of his legal career, representing poor individuals in criminal cases as well as large businesses, such as the Illinois Central Railroad. Lincoln argued 175 cases before the Illinois Supreme Court, serving as the single attorney in 51 of those cases (31 of which he won). As an attorney, he developed a reputation for integrity and earned the nickname “Honest Abe.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P4'>In 1846, Lincoln won an election as a member of the Whig Party to the U.S. House of Representatives for Illinois. As a freshman congressman, he helped author legislation to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but the bill died due to insufficient support. More notably, Lincoln opposed the Mexican-American War which erupted in 1846 due to a border dispute between the United States and Mexico. He criticized Democratic president James K. Polk, but this proved unpopular in his home state. He had promised to only serve one term in Congress and declined to run for reelection. He returned to Springfield after the expiration of his term in 1849 and resumed his law practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P5'>Lincoln’s political ambitions continued to grow in the 1850s. The volatile debate over the future of slavery in the territories, especially following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854—which overturned slavery restrictions established by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and opened all western territories to slavery through popular sovereignty (vote of the residents)—inspired Lincoln to speak publicly about his opposition to slavery. His chief rival became Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas, a powerful voice in the national Democratic Party, and the author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Lincoln gave numerous speeches denouncing slavery as a moral wrong and opposing its extension into the territories. However, like most northerners, he was not an abolitionist and did not advocate for the immediate end of slavery across the United States. Most white Americans during the 1850s embraced white supremacy, and many northerners did not want African Americans—as slaves or as free people—in their communities. Lincoln believed that southern states had the legal right to maintain the institution of slavery within their own borders, and he fended off accusations that he was for African American equality. For years he gave tacit support to a plan promoted among moderate politicians to send freed slaves to Africa.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P6'>The issue of slavery in the territories effectively broke apart the Whig Party and gave rise to the new Republican Party. Lincoln joined this new anti-slavery party and by 1858 received the party’s nomination in Illinois to challenge Douglas’s reelection to the U.S. Senate. Upon receiving the nomination, Lincoln gave one of his most famous speeches, declaring in part that “a house divided against itself cannot stand”—a reference to the United States being half slaveholding and half free—and predicting that the fight over slavery would either make the country give in to slaveholding interests or end the institution. During the 1858 Illinois campaign, Lincoln and Douglas engaged in eight public debates which have become the most famous political debates in United States history. Douglas championed his principle of “popular sovereignty,” allowing white residents of the territories to make their new states free or slaveholding, while Lincoln advanced a moral opposition to slavery in the territories as contrary to the principles of American freedom. Douglas ultimately won the Senate election, but the debates catapulted Lincoln to national fame and the leading voice for the growing anti-slavery movement in the north
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P7'>Only two years later, in 1860, the Republican Party nominated Lincoln for U.S. president. His chief rival was, again, Stephen Douglas. The election was the most contested and significant in American history. The Democratic Party split during its convention over the defense of slavery. Douglas and his outwardly neutral platform on slavery received the party’s formal nomination, but many southern delegates walked out to hold their convention, nominating John C. Breckenridge as the champion of pro-slavery interests. Talk of secession, which had circulated in years past, increased as southern politicians warned that election of Lincoln would be a direct assault upon their slaveholding interests and justify disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P8'>Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election without any southern support, not only placing the first truly anti-slavery president in the White House but proving that northern voters could elect a candidate against southern interests. Within weeks, states in the lower south began holding secession conventions to declare their separation from the Union. South Carolina led the way with its ordnance of secession passing on December 20, 1860. Mississippi was second, on January 9, 1861. In total, seven southern states declared secession even before Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P9'>Lincoln entered the presidency in the midst of this secession crisis. He rejected the legitimacy of the lower south’s separation from the Union. The matter erupted into open hostilities in April 1861, when Confederate forces attacked and overwhelmed federal troops at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. In response, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion, as he called it. Northern states responded enthusiastically, while several states in the upper south—including Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee—chose to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P10'>Lincoln’s objective at the start of the Civil War was restoration of the Union as it was. He resisted efforts by more radical anti-slavery northerners to attack slavery itself, and overruled Union general John C. Frémont’s effort to liberate slaves in Missouri in 1861. His actions were guided by concerns regarding his legal authority to challenge slavery where it already existed, and from fears that such steps would drive moderate Unionists in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland into the Confederacy. (Lincoln still personally opposed slavery and in 1862 signed an emancipation act liberating enslaved people in Washington, D.C., fulfilling a goal he had first undertaken as a congressman in the 1840s.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P11'>However, as Confederate military forces won multiple battlefield victories in 1861 and 1862, prolonging the conflict, Lincoln sought more desperate measures. For one, thousands of enslaved people had fled to Union lines, and more arriving daily. Secondly, the institution was the Confederacy’s greatest economic and labor interest. Millions of enslaved people grew crops that fed and funded the Confederate war effort, and southern officials used slave labor to construct forts and trenches that held back the Union armies. Recognizing that the Union could not defeat the Confederacy while protecting or leaving the institution of slavery untouched, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in secessionist areas permanently free. Although the proclamation was limited in scope (as it was a military measure that did not, nor could not, liberate enslaved people in areas not in rebellion against federal authority), it was a revolutionary act in American history. It formally changed the Union objective of the war, from preserving it as it was to “a new birth of freedom,” as Lincoln famously said in a speech in November 1863 at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Additionally, the proclamation authorized federal officers to protect the freedom of all enslaved people who fled to Union armies in Confederate territories and to liberate those they encountered during their campaigns in the south. Finally, the Emancipation Proclamation formally authorized the United States military to enlist African American soldiers. As a result around 180,000 black soldiers fought for the Union during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P12'>Throughout the Civil War, Lincoln struggled to lead the Union war effort in a challenging political and military environment. Democrats in the north vehemently opposed his administration and Republican Party policies, particularly those against slavery. Union generals in Virginia failed to defeat the Confederate army, lowering morale in the north and boosting prospects of southern success. Lincoln managed to handle these various challenges well, often accepting public criticism from generals and relieving them of command only when they failed to deliver military victories. He also stretched the authority of the presidency, authorizing the imprisonment of critics he believed directly harmed the war effort. While his administration was accused of violating the civil rights of some Americans, the Republican-led Congress frequently backed Lincoln and expanding his power.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P13'>In 1864, Lincoln feared he would lose reelection as the Civil War continued to drag on, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and millions of dollars. However, through battlefield successes by Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan in Virginia and Georgia, Lincoln won the election and support to continue the war until Confederate defeat. He also worked behind the scenes with Congress and various state leaders to legally end slavery through a constitutional amendment. While he voiced some support for the old plan of relocating freed slaves to Africa, by the end of the war Lincoln knew such plan was impractical and he supported protecting basic civil rights of African Americans within the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P14'>In the spring of 1865, the Confederate war effort began to collapse. Much of Lincoln’s attention was turned to reconstructing the former Confederate areas, some of which were already under federal control. He advocated for a speedy reunification, without malice or vengeance, and one in which former secessionists were welcomed back to the Union without slavery and with some recognitions of black civil rights. In April 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to General Grant in Virginia and Union forces chased down the last southern troops across the lower south. On April 14, as the Civil War was ending, Lincoln was shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. The mortally wounded president was carried to a boarding house across the street where he passed away the following morning. Lincoln’s murder ended most hopes for a peaceful reconstruction, as it inflamed tensions in the north and energized Radical Republicans who Lincoln had largely held in check.
</p>

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52703P0'>Joseph Eggleston Johnson was a career U.S. military officer who served as a general in the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P1'>Born near Farmville, Virginia, on February 3, 1807, Johnston attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduated in 1829. He served as a lieutenant with the Fourth U.S. Artillery in the early 1830s, eventually resigning in 1837 to pursue a career in civil engineering. After a short stint as a civilian engineer in Florida during the Second Seminole War, Johnston returned the U.S. Army and was soon after promoted to captain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P2'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Johnston served on the personal staff of General Winfield Scott. He performed very well during the war, seeing significant combat and receiving wounds at the Battle of Cerro Gordo and at Chapultepec. Army officials issued Johnston multiple brevet (honorary) promotions for his actions during the war, leading him to holding the rank of brevet colonel. (Brevet promotions were not formally recognized in regular Army service, and Johnston returned to the official rank of captain after the Mexican War ended in 1848.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P3'>During the 1850s, Johnston petitioned for a promotion to colonel in the regular Army based upon his brevet ranks. The U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, a fellow West Point graduate, rejected the petition, but did appoint Johnston a lieutenant colonel in the First U.S. Cavalry, stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. With this unit, Johnston saw field operations against Native Americans in Wyoming Territory and was present in territorial Kansas during the battle over slavery there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P4'>In 1860, when the Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army, Brigadier General Thomas Jesup, passed away, Secretary of War John B. Floyd selected Johnston as the replacement. The appointment included a promotion to brigadier general, placing Johnston above other notable Army officers of his generation, including future Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P5'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, and Virginia declared its secession from the Union, Johnston resigned his commission. As brigadier general, Johnston was the highest ranking U.S. Army officer to resign and join the Confederacy. He initially received an appointment as major general over the Virginia militia, but soon after learned that his position would be downgraded to brigadier general in favor of Robert E. Lee filling the state militia’s sole major general position. Johnston rejected the offer from the Virginia state government and instead accepted a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate States Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P6'>Johnston organized the Army of the Shenandoah in the spring of 1861, and was the highest ranking Confederate officer at the First Battle of Bull Run in July that year. However, he deferred to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, who was more familiar with the terrain and troop dispositions around Manassas, Virginia, and thus had less to do with Confederate actions during the engagement.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P7'>Johnston was promoted to full general in August 1861, but was upset that three of his pre-war colleagues outranked him in the Confederacy. This led to friction between Johnston and President Jefferson Davis for the rest of the war. Nevertheless, Johnston was placed in command of the Army of Northern Virginia, seen by many as the most important Confederate army due to its responsibilities of protecting the Confederate capital of Richmond from Union force. In the spring of 1862, Johnston conducted a strategic retreat toward Richmond in the face of Union General George B. McClellan’s Army of the Potomac. During the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, 1862, Johnston was wounded and removed the field for treatment. General Robert E. Lee was given command of the Army of Northern Virginia, and through his aggressive and successful attacks against McClellan, Lee retained command of that army for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P8'>In November 1862, Johnston recovered from the wound received at Seven Pines and received orders to the western theater. He had nominal command over Confederates in the region, but found he had little practical control over two large armies—one led by General John C. Pemberton and the other commanded by General Braxton Bragg—already involved in campaigns in Tennessee and Mississippi. In early 1863. Johnston attempted to gather reinforcements to support Pemberton in protecting Vicksburg from Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army. Grant’s army  won a series of engagements cutting off Vicksburg from Jackson, Mississippi, blocking Johnston from uniting with Pemberton. Johnston recommended that Pemberton abandon Vicksburg to prevent his army from being surrounded by Grant. News of this recommendation upset many Confederates, including Jefferson Davis, who recognized the value of Vicksburg to controlling the Mississippi River. Pemberton’s army was indeed surrounded and captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. Davis partially blamed the loss of Vicksburg on Johnston’s failure to aggressively reinforce Pemberton, leading to additional tensions between the Confederate president and Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P9'>A few weeks later, General Bragg resigned his command of the Army of Tennessee after losing to Union forces at Chattanooga. Despite Davis’s dislike of Johnston, the Confederacy had few generals experienced or capable of leading an army. He reluctantly placed Johnston in command of the Army of Tennessee in late December 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P10'>In the spring of 1864, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman launched a campaign from Chattanooga to capture the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Johnston led his Army of Tennessee in a series of maneuvers to block the Union army. Over the next several weeks, Sherman’s larger army repeatedly attacked and flanked the Confederates, prompting Johnston to conduct a strategic withdrawal back toward Atlanta, taking new defensive positions each time. Although Johnston’s methods slowed the Union advance and inflicted more casualties on Union forces than suffered by the Confederates, Johnston retreated 110 miles in two months and failed to stop Sherman’s threat to Atlanta. Frustrated by Johnston’s perceived lack of aggression, Davis relieved Johnston of command in July 1864. His replacement, John Bell Hood, launched bold attacks against Sherman but failed, and the Confederates had to abandon Atlanta in September 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P11'>Having lost command of the Army of Tennessee, Johnston went to South Carolina to sit out the rest of the war. However, as Confederate fortunes continued to fail, numerous political leaders called for Johnston to be reinstated. President Davis vehemently opposed the recommendation, having lost faith in Johnston. Only after Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens and numerous Confederate officials tried to circumvent Davis’s authority did the president acquiesce and order Johnston to field command. In February 1865, he received control of Confederate forces in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. He consolidated his troops, but the combined force amounted only to about 25,000 soldiers. Johnston hoped to unite his force with Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia, but Lee refused. A few weeks later, in mid-April 1865, Lee was defeated by Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia, and shortly afterwards Johnston’s Confederates were finally overwhelmed by Sherman’s Union soldiers in North Carolina. During negotiations with Sherman, Johnston formally surrendered all Confederate soldiers scattered across North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida—amounting, on paper, to nearly 90,000 Confederates. It was the largest surrender of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P12'>Federal forces paroled Johnston on May 2, 1865, allowing him to return to civilian life with the promise to not take up arms against the United States. He pursued various business interests, including serving as president of the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad, and working as an insurance agent for New York Life Insurance Company. Johnston also wrote his memoirs, voicing criticism of Jefferson Davis and many other former Confederates. On the other hand, he developed a strong friendship with his former adversary, William Tecumseh Sherman. Grateful for the generous terms of surrender and respect shown to him by Sherman at the end of the war, Johnston reportedly denounced anyone who spoke ill of Sherman in his presence, and served as an honorary pallbearer at Sherman’s funeral in New York City in February 1891. Johnston became sick immediately after the funeral—possibly from exposure to cold temperatures and rain during the procession—and died of pneumonia a month later, on March 21, 1891.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P13'>Johnston had been married to Lydia McLane Johnston. The couple had no children, and Lydia died in 1887. Both are buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS97207P0'>John C. Pemberton was a Confederate general, most famous for commanding troops in the unsuccessful defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P1'>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 10, 1814, Pemberton was raised and educated in the north. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837, and immediately afterwards served as a U.S. artillery officer in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He remained a professional soldier for the next two decades, serving at various forts and posts in the United States, along the Canadian border, and in the west. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Pemberton served with the 4th U.S. Artillery and took part in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de La Palma, and Monterrey. He earned the brevet (honorary) rank of captain for his actions at Monterrey. He continued to serve with distinction at several other engagements in Mexico, including the storming of Chapultepec castle and the battle at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P2'>In 1848, following the Mexican-American War, Pemberton married Martha Thompson of Virginia. The couple had one daughter and three sons, all born in the 1850s. Pemberton continued to serve at a variety of posts in the United States, and saw additional action in Florida against the Seminoles from 1849 to 1850, and then again from 1856 to 1857. After spending a year in New Mexico Territory and three years in Minnesota, Pemberton was sent to Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1861, in the midst of the secession crisis. Despite his northern upbringing, Pemberton resigned his commission from the United States Army when the Civil War erupted in April 1861. He immediately volunteered for Confederate service and received an appointment as assistant adjutant general of Confederate forces at Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P3'>Because of his lengthy military experience, Pemberton rose quickly in Confederate ranks, reaching major general in January 1862. He was placed in command of the military department defending Georgia and South Carolina, but soon ran into conflict with the states’ governors who objected to Pemberton's assertion that the survival of his army was more important than defending the region, and due to mistrust of his northern heritage. Confederate President Jefferson Davis placed the more popular General P. G. T. Beauregard in charge of the defense of Georgia and South Carolina and relocated Pemberton to a new military department in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P4'>At his new assignment in Mississippi, in the fall of 1862, Pemberton received the promotion to lieutenant general. He was responsible for defending the Mississippi River and key port towns, such as Vicksburg, from federal attack. Unlike the more famous Confederate armies to the east, Pemberton’s command was made up of southern troops who had suffered several defeats against aggressive Union commanders at battles like Shiloh and Corinth. Many of Pemberton’s troops were separated, and he struggled to unite his force to stage an effective defense against Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army, which began a campaign for Vicksburg in December 1862. Making matters worse for the Confederate general, his orders were to hold Vicksburg at all cost—meaning that he had limited ability to maneuver or even withdraw to save his army in the face of Grant’s larger force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P5'>Between December 1862 and July 1863, Grant conducted a slow, creative, but ultimately persistent campaign to surround and capture Vicksburg. Utilizing his aggressive subordinate William T. Sherman, Grant cut Pemberton and his Confederate troops off at Vicksburg and burned Mississippi’s capital of Jackson in May 1863. After being besieged in Vicksburg by Grant’s troops for six weeks, Pemberton realized he had no other choice but to surrender. On July 4, 1863, Pemberton ordered his army to lay down its arms and open Vicksburg to Grant’s army. The defeat occurred one day after Robert E. Lee’s battlefield loss at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, delivering a double blow to Confederate morale.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P6'>Pemberton and his men were captured and paroled by Union forces—a practice by which prisoners were allowed to return home or to encampments under the sworn oath not to take up arms until formally exchanged for Union prisoners. Pemberton traveled to Richmond where he remained idle for several months. Not receiving a new assignment, he resigned his general’s commission in May 1864. President Davis offered him a conciliatory assignment as a lieutenant colonel of artillery, which he accepted. He temporarily commanded the artillery defense of Richmond before taking an appointment as inspector general of artillery. Pemberton was captured by Union troops in mid-April 1865 during the final days of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P7'>Following the Civil War, Pemberton moved to Warrenton, Virginia. He remained there until 1876, when he moved back to Pennsylvania. He lived quietly on a farm, passing away in 1881. Pemberton is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32004263P0'>Stephen Dill Lee was a Confederate general and president of Mississippi State University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P1'>Born on September 22, 1833, in Charleston, South Carolina, Lee was raised and educated in the south until he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1850 and graduated in 1854. He served in the United States Army for the rest of the 1850s, with assignments in Florida, Kansas, and Dakota Territory. Lee served as a quartermaster (supply officer) during most of his assignments. When southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Lee resigned his commission and joined the Confederate cause. His first appointment, in March 1861, was as assistant adjutant general and assistant inspector general for southern forces at Charleston, South Carolina. In April 1861, he was appointed an aid to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, commander of Confederate forces at Charleston. Lee delivered Beauregard’s message to Major Robert Anderson, commander of federal troops at Fort Sumter, demanding his surrender. The subsequent Confederate bombardment and capture of the fort sparked the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P2'>Lee remained in South Carolina for most of 1861. He then received command of an artillery battery in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1862 and appointed an artillery officer in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed admirably during battles near Richmond, Virginia, in the spring of 1862. Lee was promoted and, despite a brief stint as commander of a Virginia cavalry regiment, continued to be one of the Confederacy’s best artillery officers. He fought at the Battle of Second Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, in August 1862, and played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Antietam, when his cannons engaged in heavy combat near the Dunker Church.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P3'>Following Antietam, Confederate officials promoted Lee to brigadier general and sent him to Mississippi to command of an infantry division. In late December 1862, Lee’s division held off an attack by Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman at Chickasaw Bayou, Mississippi. He took command of a Confederate brigade in January 1863, but was again called to artillery service in May 1863, when he was placed in charge of the Confederate artillery defending Vicksburg, Mississippi. His performance at the Battle of Champion Hill garnered praise, but Lee and the rest of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton’s Confederate soldiers were soon surrounded by Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army at Vicksburg and captured.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P4'>Lee was paroled by Union troops and was not allowed to return to service until formally exchanged by federal and Confederate officials. While on parole, he was promoted to major general. Released from parole in October 1863, Lee took command of cavalry troops within the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana. In May 1864, Lee was placed in overall command of the department. Confederates within his command, led by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, were victorious at the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads on June 10, 1864, but suffered a defeat at Tupelo the following month, this time with Lee on the field.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P5'>On June 23, 1864, Lee was promoted to lieutenant general. He was 30 years old, making him the youngest lieutenant general in the Confederate army. On July 26, 1864, he was given command of a corps in General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, then battling William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army near Atlanta, Georgia. He fought in numerous battles in the Atlanta area, and then during Hood’s campaign into Tennessee, sustaining wounds at least two different times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P6'>After recovering from a wound he suffered in December 1864 near Nashville, Lee was assigned to General Joseph E. Johnston’s army in the Carolinas. He fought during the final campaign in North Carolina, surrendering in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P7'>After the war, Lee moved to Columbus, Mississippi, with his wife Regina Harrison, whom he had married in February 1865 while recovering from his wound. The couple settled on a large plantation given to them by Regina’s father and had one child. Lee struggled to make the plantation financially successful. He turned to the study of agriculture, and became a strong proponent of education. Lee briefly served in the Mississippi State Senate in the late 1870s and then helped found the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (present-day Mississippi State University). In 1880 became the school’s first president, remaining in that role until 1899. Lee kept an interest in state politics, serving as a delegate in Mississippi’s Constitutional Convention in 1890, which disenfranchised thousands of Black voters and more firmly entrenched white supremacy in Mississippi society.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P8'>Lee was active in promoting the preservation of Civil War history, serving as president of the Mississippi Historical Society and president of the Vicksburg National Military Park Association. He helped organize veteran reunions, and wrote several articles about the Civil War. In 1908, he fell sick after giving a speech in Vicksburg to visiting Union veterans. He passed away on May 28, 1908. Lee is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P0'>During the American Civil War, to disband a military unit was to formally dissolve it. Once dissolved, soldiers returned to their state capitals to deposit their weapons and other publicly owned property. Units were disbanded for a number of reasons throughout the war, including the end of their service agreement and surrender. Frequently, officers disbanded a unit with diminished strength and reorganized it to form a full strength unit. As the Lieber Code did not recognize un-uniformed guerrilla fighters, it was also common for leaders of guerrilla units, like Confederate Col. John Singleton Mosby, to disband their command rather than formally surrender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P1'>Following Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in April 1864, the enormous process of demobilizing all Confederate armies began. The terms for disbanding Confederate military units Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant offered Lee were mimicked by other Union commanders. Rather that disbanding the men without any restraints, Grant classified them as paroled prisoners of war, which would legally forbid them for taking up arms against the United States again.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99666P0'>In warfare, an army moving into an enemy’s home territory is often described as an invasion. During the American Civil War, most examples of military forces moving into enemy territory involved Union armies advancing into Confederate states. Some of these incursions were temporary, such as small cavalry raids to destroy Confederate supplies and even larger campaigns behind Confederate lines to harm Southern infrastructure (such as William T. Sherman’s “March Through Georgia”). However, Union victory in the Civil War depended upon the United States Army conducting offensive operations and occupying large portions of the South. These efforts split apart the Confederacy, placed secessionist communities back under federal control, and reduced the Confederate armies’ ability to wage war. Pro-secessionist Southerners considered these efforts to be federal invasions, and described communities captured by Union armies as being overrun. However, pro-Union Southerners cheered the arrival of Union soldiers, considering them liberators rather than invaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99666P1'>Although the Confederacy fought a defensive war, Southern military forces occasionally conducted incursions into northern communities. Robert E. Lee’s Maryland Campaign in 1862 (which culminated in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862) was seen by many Marylanders as an invasion of their state. His second offensive campaign into the North, in the summer of 1863, was widely reported in the Northern press as a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. That campaign ultimately resulted in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

As you will remember when you &amp; Genl <rs ref='#S64045'>Johnson</rs> were with us there were not in Miss. armed men enough to meet the <rs ref='#S71916'>enemy</rs> then threatening us—that desparity in nembers has existed and continues to this time &amp; the crisis in our affairs in my opinion is now upon us. I do not believe the Fe<add place='above'>ds</add> will abandon the idea or effort to take <rs ref='#S51788'>Vicksburg</rs> and reopen the <rs ref='#S63143'>river</rs>—it is a political necessity with the <rs ref='#S52243'>Lincoln</rs> government in view of the condition of the North West. With the concurrant opinions of Genls <rs ref='#S52703'>Johnston</rs> and <rs ref='#S97207'>Pemberton</rs> these Militia troops have been continued in service under command of Confederate Genls and when Genl Pemberton is satisfied that he has <rs ref='#S70882'>Confederate Troops</rs> sufficient to defend the state without them nothing would afford me more pleasure than to send them <del rend='overstrike'>home</del> ^to their^ <rs ref='#S91218'>farms</rs>—Their presence in the field has been necessary to save north Miss from being <rs ref='#S99666'>over run</rs> and desolated while all the Confederate Troops were engaged with superior forces of the enemy—at Vicksburg, <rs ref='#S98187'>Port Hudson</rs> and they have protected north Miss for the last six months &amp; the provisions which now support the army &amp; people of south Miss—has been saved from distruction by the enemy by the State Troops. When Genl Pemberton could not spare a man to send them from the Confederate Troops. A part of these state <del rend='overstrike'>troops</del> ^militia^ were ordered by Genl Pemberton from <rs ref='#S51804'>Columbus</rs> to Vicksburg when he regarded it in danger &amp; Brig Genl <rs ref='#S32004263'>Lee</rs> complimented them

          <p corresp='TTP25106335P0' xml:id='OTP25106335P0'>for gallantry and discipline The letter is now on file in my office If I <rs ref='#S25023805'>disband these troops</rs> to make provisions I am sure we loose ten fold the amount of provisions in North Miss by the plundering &amp; <rs ref='#S91669'>burning</rs> by the enemy. I have been much assailed by the press for keeping these troops in the field but Genls Johnston &amp; Pemberton have thought it necessary to the safety of the state &amp; I have fully concurred in that opin-ion—and the result proves that we were right—for North Miss defended by them still feeds the army &amp; the people &amp; I have found no one who could devise the means of defend-ing it without them—Genl Pemberton regards their services essential &amp; orders then maintained &amp; paid as Confederate Troops and every Militia man in service is under his command and whenever he deems the state safe without their assistance they will be sent home but to send them home &amp; give up North Miss I know Mr <rs ref='#S63185'>President</rs> you would not advise
