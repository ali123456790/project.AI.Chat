                    <p xml:id='OTPS63158P0'>Samuel J. Gholson was a U.S. representative, U.S. district judge, and Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P1'>Born in Richmond, Kentucky, on May 19, 1808, Gholson spent much of his boyhood in Alabama. He began practicing law in Russellville, Alabama, in 1829 and shortly afterwards opened a law office in Athens, Mississippi. In 1835, he won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives. The following year, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi as a Democrat. He served until 1838, when his seat was declared vacant. In 1839, he received an appointment to a joint seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District and for the Southern District of Mississippi. Gholson served in that capacity until 1861, when Mississippi seceded. He had been a delegate to the state’s secession convention, following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory as president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P2'>Gholson volunteered for Confederate military service. Although enlisting as a private, due to his age and standing as a public official, he was quickly promoted, eventually rising to major general of Mississippi state troops in 1863. Gholson campaigned in the field during his military service, being present at the battles of Fort Donelson, Iuka, and Corinth in 1862. In 1864, he received a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate army and placed in command of cavalry troops. He was badly wounded in the arm and captured during the Battle of Egypt Station in December 1864. His injuries were so severe that Union officers reported him to be mortally wounded. In fact, Gholson survived the wound, but his arm had to be amputated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P3'>Gholson was released by Union forces in May 1865, after the war had ended. He immediately returned to state politics, winning a seat in the legislature that year. He served as the speaker of the house from 1865 to 1866, and then agitated against Republican Reconstruction over the next several years. He won election to the state legislature one more time, in 1878. Gholson died in 1883 and is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi. He had been married to Margraten Ann Ragsdale, but the couple had no surviving children.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52585P0'>Daniel Ruggles was a Confederate general during the Civil War. Born in Barre, Massachusetts, on January 31, 1810, Ruggles grew up in the north and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating from West Point in 1833, he served at a variety of U.S. Army posts in the west and south, and participated in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He was promoted to captain in 1846, during the Mexican-American War, and fought in several battles, including at Vera Cruz, Chapultepec, and Mexico City. He remained in the army during the 1850s, taking part in a military campaign against Mormon settlers over governance of Utah Territory, before taking leave due to health reasons.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P1'>When the Civil War erupted in early 1861, Ruggles resigned his commission. Although he was from Massachusetts, he had married Richardetta Barnes Mason Hooe, from Virginia, and sympathized with the secessionist cause. He received a commission with the Virginia militia and assisted in the defense of Chesapeake Bay from U.S. Navy activity. Appointed brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the summer of 1861, Ruggles was sent to command a brigade in General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Pensacola. He had been placed in charge of a division within Bragg’s army when it moved into Mississippi to join General Albert Sidney Johnston’s Army of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P2'>On April 6, 1862, Johnston’s Confederates attacked Union soldiers under Ulysses S. Grant at Pittsburgh Landing along the Tennessee River in southwest Tennessee. The battle became more popularly known as Shiloh, due to a nearby church by that name. The Confederate assault was initially successful, pushing the Union soldiers back toward the river. However, some federal troops managed to hold a defensive position against repeated attacks. The scene was called the ”Hornets Nest” due to the intensity of the fighting. Ruggles called for every Confederate cannon to assemble and fire into the Union position. The result was a line of 62 Confederate cannons—the largest concentration of artillery in North America at the time—nicknamed “Ruggles’s Battery,” firing for hours into the “Hornets Nest” until the Union soldiers retreated. Despite the Confederate success the first day, Albert Sidney Johnston was mortally wounded and Grant’s troops rallied the following day to force the southern soldiers back, resulting in a Union victory.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P3'>Following Shiloh, Ruggles battled Union soldiers in Mississippi and Louisiana. He participated in an unsuccessful campaign to recapture Baton Rouge from federal forces and a failed Confederate attempt to secure the town of Corinth, Mississippi. Although southern defeats, Ruggles had performed well. He spent the rest of the war in administrative positions, including being appointed head of the prison system, overseeing the final exchange of Union prisoners when the war ended.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P4'>After the Civil War, Ruggles moved to Virginia where he took up farming and real estate business. He died in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on June 1, 1897, and is buried in the Confederate City in that town.  He and his wife Richardetta had four sons, three of which survived to adulthood.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71951P0'>James Ronald Chalmers was a Confederate officer and served as a U.S. Representative for Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P1'>Born in Halifax County, Virginia, on January 11, 1831, Chalmers moved with his family to Mississippi during his youth, settling in Holly Springs. After graduating from South Carolina College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in Holly Springs in 1853. Five years later, he was elected district attorney. He was selected as a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in 1861, and helped pass the ordinance of secession which declared the state separate from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P2'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, Chalmers volunteered for military service. He was first commissioned as a captain the Confederate army and soon received a promotion to colonel of the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. After commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida, Chalmers was promoted again, to brigadier general. He performed well during the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and again during the Battle of Murfreesboro from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. In 1864, he fought in western Tennessee, including the Battle of Fort Pillow, which involved Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest murdering several African American Union prisoners. In 1865, he was placed in charge of all Mississippi cavalry in the Mississippi and western Tennessee region. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P3'>After the Civil War, Chalmers returned to Mississippi and resumed practicing law. He gained fame among white conservatives through his opposition to Republican Reconstruction, and led an armed group of Democrats to Friar’s Point in 1876 to chase away the sheriff and intimidate African Americans in the area. That same year he won a state senate seat. When Mississippi was readmitted to the Union, Chalmers won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1877 to 1880. Although he again won reelection in 1880, his Republican opponent, John R. Lynch, disputed the election results. A Congressional investigation found in favor for Lynch, but not until 1882 after Chalmers had served most of the term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P4'>Around 1882, Chalmers broke with the traditional Democratic Party in Mississippi. He ran for reelection in 1882, but as an Independent Democrat with support from some Republicans and the Greenback Party (which was a third-party political movement that focused on economic matters). A traditional Democrat candidate, Van H. Manning, won the election, but this time Chalmers contested the results. Congress decided in Chalmer’s favor and he reentered Congress in June 1884, but lost reelection later that fall.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P5'>Chalmers returned to practicing law after the 1884 election. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and died on April 29, 1882. He had been married to Rebecca Arthur; the couple had two children. Chalmers is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS97207P0'>John C. Pemberton was a Confederate general, most famous for commanding troops in the unsuccessful defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P1'>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 10, 1814, Pemberton was raised and educated in the north. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837, and immediately afterwards served as a U.S. artillery officer in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He remained a professional soldier for the next two decades, serving at various forts and posts in the United States, along the Canadian border, and in the west. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Pemberton served with the 4th U.S. Artillery and took part in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de La Palma, and Monterrey. He earned the brevet (honorary) rank of captain for his actions at Monterrey. He continued to serve with distinction at several other engagements in Mexico, including the storming of Chapultepec castle and the battle at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P2'>In 1848, following the Mexican-American War, Pemberton married Martha Thompson of Virginia. The couple had one daughter and three sons, all born in the 1850s. Pemberton continued to serve at a variety of posts in the United States, and saw additional action in Florida against the Seminoles from 1849 to 1850, and then again from 1856 to 1857. After spending a year in New Mexico Territory and three years in Minnesota, Pemberton was sent to Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1861, in the midst of the secession crisis. Despite his northern upbringing, Pemberton resigned his commission from the United States Army when the Civil War erupted in April 1861. He immediately volunteered for Confederate service and received an appointment as assistant adjutant general of Confederate forces at Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P3'>Because of his lengthy military experience, Pemberton rose quickly in Confederate ranks, reaching major general in January 1862. He was placed in command of the military department defending Georgia and South Carolina, but soon ran into conflict with the states’ governors who objected to Pemberton's assertion that the survival of his army was more important than defending the region, and due to mistrust of his northern heritage. Confederate President Jefferson Davis placed the more popular General P. G. T. Beauregard in charge of the defense of Georgia and South Carolina and relocated Pemberton to a new military department in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P4'>At his new assignment in Mississippi, in the fall of 1862, Pemberton received the promotion to lieutenant general. He was responsible for defending the Mississippi River and key port towns, such as Vicksburg, from federal attack. Unlike the more famous Confederate armies to the east, Pemberton’s command was made up of southern troops who had suffered several defeats against aggressive Union commanders at battles like Shiloh and Corinth. Many of Pemberton’s troops were separated, and he struggled to unite his force to stage an effective defense against Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army, which began a campaign for Vicksburg in December 1862. Making matters worse for the Confederate general, his orders were to hold Vicksburg at all cost—meaning that he had limited ability to maneuver or even withdraw to save his army in the face of Grant’s larger force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P5'>Between December 1862 and July 1863, Grant conducted a slow, creative, but ultimately persistent campaign to surround and capture Vicksburg. Utilizing his aggressive subordinate William T. Sherman, Grant cut Pemberton and his Confederate troops off at Vicksburg and burned Mississippi’s capital of Jackson in May 1863. After being besieged in Vicksburg by Grant’s troops for six weeks, Pemberton realized he had no other choice but to surrender. On July 4, 1863, Pemberton ordered his army to lay down its arms and open Vicksburg to Grant’s army. The defeat occurred one day after Robert E. Lee’s battlefield loss at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, delivering a double blow to Confederate morale.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P6'>Pemberton and his men were captured and paroled by Union forces—a practice by which prisoners were allowed to return home or to encampments under the sworn oath not to take up arms until formally exchanged for Union prisoners. Pemberton traveled to Richmond where he remained idle for several months. Not receiving a new assignment, he resigned his general’s commission in May 1864. President Davis offered him a conciliatory assignment as a lieutenant colonel of artillery, which he accepted. He temporarily commanded the artillery defense of Richmond before taking an appointment as inspector general of artillery. Pemberton was captured by Union troops in mid-April 1865 during the final days of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P7'>Following the Civil War, Pemberton moved to Warrenton, Virginia. He remained there until 1876, when he moved back to Pennsylvania. He lived quietly on a farm, passing away in 1881. Pemberton is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51696P0'>Tullius Cicero Tupper was a general in the Mississippi militia during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P1'>Born in Barnard, Vermont, on February 9, 1809, Tupper was educated in the north and graduated from the University of Vermont before moving to Canton, Mississippi. He practiced law in Mississippi and became involved in newspaper publishing, running the <hi rend='italic'>Canton Herald</hi> in the 1830s. He became highly respected over the next two decades, serving as an advisor to Mississippi governor John J. Pettus during the secession crisis in 1860 and 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P2'>In 1862, Tupper received a commission as major general in the Mississippi militia, tasked with organizing and improving state forces at a time when most able-bodied Mississippi men who wanted to volunteer for military service were serving in the Confederate army. Tupper clashed with Pettus over the use of the state militia. He preferred to allow militia troops to return home following training and only be called into service during emergency situations. The governor wished to keep the militia units on active duty and in garrison. Additionally, Tupper resisted efforts by Confederate officials to control state military forces. In 1863, Tupper resigned his commission and spent the rest of the war at home.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P3'>Tupper died on August 14, 1866. He was married to Mary Harding Drane and had five children. He is buried in Canton City Cemetery, Canton, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

</p>

<p corresp='TTP25106344P4' xml:id='OTP25106344P4'>I am glad to find that I am mistaken in this; for the placing &amp; organization of them into Regts is a thankless &amp; troublesome task from which I am glad to be relieved

</p>

<p corresp='TTP25106345P1' xml:id='OTP25106345P1'>I understand your position now to be that I am to have no control or command over these troops, until they are organized &amp; ordered to report to me; and shall govern myself accordingly
