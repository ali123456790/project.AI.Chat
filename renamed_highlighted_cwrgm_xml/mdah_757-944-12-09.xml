                    <p xml:id='OTPS97207P0'>John C. Pemberton was a Confederate general, most famous for commanding troops in the unsuccessful defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P1'>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 10, 1814, Pemberton was raised and educated in the north. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837, and immediately afterwards served as a U.S. artillery officer in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He remained a professional soldier for the next two decades, serving at various forts and posts in the United States, along the Canadian border, and in the west. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Pemberton served with the 4th U.S. Artillery and took part in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de La Palma, and Monterrey. He earned the brevet (honorary) rank of captain for his actions at Monterrey. He continued to serve with distinction at several other engagements in Mexico, including the storming of Chapultepec castle and the battle at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P2'>In 1848, following the Mexican-American War, Pemberton married Martha Thompson of Virginia. The couple had one daughter and three sons, all born in the 1850s. Pemberton continued to serve at a variety of posts in the United States, and saw additional action in Florida against the Seminoles from 1849 to 1850, and then again from 1856 to 1857. After spending a year in New Mexico Territory and three years in Minnesota, Pemberton was sent to Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1861, in the midst of the secession crisis. Despite his northern upbringing, Pemberton resigned his commission from the United States Army when the Civil War erupted in April 1861. He immediately volunteered for Confederate service and received an appointment as assistant adjutant general of Confederate forces at Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P3'>Because of his lengthy military experience, Pemberton rose quickly in Confederate ranks, reaching major general in January 1862. He was placed in command of the military department defending Georgia and South Carolina, but soon ran into conflict with the states’ governors who objected to Pemberton's assertion that the survival of his army was more important than defending the region, and due to mistrust of his northern heritage. Confederate President Jefferson Davis placed the more popular General P. G. T. Beauregard in charge of the defense of Georgia and South Carolina and relocated Pemberton to a new military department in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P4'>At his new assignment in Mississippi, in the fall of 1862, Pemberton received the promotion to lieutenant general. He was responsible for defending the Mississippi River and key port towns, such as Vicksburg, from federal attack. Unlike the more famous Confederate armies to the east, Pemberton’s command was made up of southern troops who had suffered several defeats against aggressive Union commanders at battles like Shiloh and Corinth. Many of Pemberton’s troops were separated, and he struggled to unite his force to stage an effective defense against Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army, which began a campaign for Vicksburg in December 1862. Making matters worse for the Confederate general, his orders were to hold Vicksburg at all cost—meaning that he had limited ability to maneuver or even withdraw to save his army in the face of Grant’s larger force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P5'>Between December 1862 and July 1863, Grant conducted a slow, creative, but ultimately persistent campaign to surround and capture Vicksburg. Utilizing his aggressive subordinate William T. Sherman, Grant cut Pemberton and his Confederate troops off at Vicksburg and burned Mississippi’s capital of Jackson in May 1863. After being besieged in Vicksburg by Grant’s troops for six weeks, Pemberton realized he had no other choice but to surrender. On July 4, 1863, Pemberton ordered his army to lay down its arms and open Vicksburg to Grant’s army. The defeat occurred one day after Robert E. Lee’s battlefield loss at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, delivering a double blow to Confederate morale.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P6'>Pemberton and his men were captured and paroled by Union forces—a practice by which prisoners were allowed to return home or to encampments under the sworn oath not to take up arms until formally exchanged for Union prisoners. Pemberton traveled to Richmond where he remained idle for several months. Not receiving a new assignment, he resigned his general’s commission in May 1864. President Davis offered him a conciliatory assignment as a lieutenant colonel of artillery, which he accepted. He temporarily commanded the artillery defense of Richmond before taking an appointment as inspector general of artillery. Pemberton was captured by Union troops in mid-April 1865 during the final days of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P7'>Following the Civil War, Pemberton moved to Warrenton, Virginia. He remained there until 1876, when he moved back to Pennsylvania. He lived quietly on a farm, passing away in 1881. Pemberton is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25013556P0'>William Wing Loring was a career soldier who served in the U.S. Army, the Confederate Army, and in the Egyptian Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P1'>Born on December 4, 1818, in Wilmington, North Carolina, Loring moved to Florida with his family as a child. He joined a Florida militia unit at fourteen years old and saw combat against Seminole Indians. At seventeen, he traveled to Texas to fight in the Texas War for Independence, but was brought back to Florida by his father. He rejoined the Florida militia and saw additional action against Seminoles. His family sent him to a boarding school in Virginia in 1837 and he spent two years at Georgetown University, before returning to Florida to study law and become a practicing attorney in 1842. Only a year later, in 1843, Loring won a seat in the Florida House of Representatives and served until 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P2'>In 1846, Loring volunteered for the U.S. Army’s new Regiment of Mounted Rifles (later the Third Cavalry Regiment). The unit was initially intended to serve in the Oregon Territory, but was rerouted to Mexico with the outbreak of the Mexican-American War. Loring fought in several battles during that conflict, receiving two brevet (honorary) promotions for bravery, first to lieutenant colonel and then colonel. He was also severely wounded in the left arm at Mexico City, requiring amputation. Despite the loss of his arm, Loring remained in military service and received orders to lead a wagon train from Missouri Oregon in 1849. He commanded U.S. Army personnel in Oregon Territory for two years and then received various assignments in army forts in other western territories. He participated in several battles against Native Americans in the 1850s and was officially promoted to colonel in 1856. At only 38 years old, he was the young colonel in the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Loring resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. He received a commission as a brigadier general and was ordered to organize and train Confederate soldiers in western Virginia. After mixed success on the battlefield there, he moved his troops to the Shenandoah Valley to link with General Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson. Unhappy with his orders to occupy Winchester, Virginia, during the winter months of early 1862, Loring bypassed Jackson’s authority and petitioned the Confederate high command for the relocation of his force. The incident led to Loring being reassigned away from the Shenandoah and eventually being sent to command a division within General John C. Pemberton’s army in Mississippi. He participated in the Vicksburg Campaign, but his division was cut off from the rest of Pemberton’s army during the Battle of Champion’s Hill and turned eastward to link up with General Joseph E. Johnston, thereby avoiding being captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. Over the next several months, Loring served as a division commander in Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas before surrendering to Union forces in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P4'>After the Civil War, the Khedive of Egypt offered high ranking military positions to respected veterans of the recent conflict. Loring was one of around fifty Union and Confederate veterans recommended by William Tecumseh Sherman for the opportunity, and Loring received an appointment as Inspector General of the Egyptian army. He spent nearly a decade in Egypt serving in campaigns in Africa, attaining a rank equivalent to major general. Loring returned to the United States around 1878. He ran for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida, but lost. He moved to New York City and was there when he died of pneumonia on December 30, 1886. He was never married. Loring’s remains were cremated and initially buried at Grace Episcopal Church in New York City. Only a few months later, his ashes were transported for reinterment in Woodlawn Cemetery in St. Augustine, Florida. They were moved again in 1920 to the Government House in St. Augustine, with a large obelisk over his grave. A century later, in 2020, Loring’s ashes were moved one more time, to a grave on private property.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
