                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD85422P0'>The cavalry units in Mississippi’s militia were mostly comprised of men from the upper classes and men who brought their horses and could afford the associated equipment. Like their infantry counterparts, men in the cavalry tended to be older, more established men who were outside the draft age and eager to serve the Confederacy, but desired to stay close to home to work their farms and care for their families. Mississippi’s militia structure was convoluted, and the cavalry was no exception. Official state units, home guard, informal local defense units, and the introduction of the Mississippi State Troops in 1862 blurred the definition of what the militia was. As the war continued, service in the militia in any of its forms did not guarantee a militiaman would stay close to home. Many units saw themselves transferred into Confederate service, such as Perrin’s Battalion Cavalry which became the 11th Regiment, Mississippi Cavalry and Davenport’s Battalion Cavalry which was merged into the 6th Regiment Mississippi Cavalry. Many units that were not transferred to the Army were sent from their local area to other parts of the state and placed under the command of Confederate officers. (Tracy L.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD64105P0'>Widows were classified as women whose legal husband died and they had not legally remarried (Cambridge Dictionary). Due to the bloodshed of the American Civil War, the United States saw a rapid increase in widowhood in the mid-to-late-nineteenth century; one estimate puts the number of widows at over 200,000 (Essential Civil War Curriculum). The Civil War altered antebellum patterns of widowhood by lowering the average age of widows, since many of those who lost their husbands to the war were in their twenties or thirties, and increasing the number of pregnant widows. Since American coverture legally subsumed a woman's identity under her husbands', many widows had no choice but to quickly remarry for social and economic protection.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD64105P1'>The Civil War also altered antebellum grieving traditions in that the presence of so many widows, often many within the same community, became more visible due to their numbers. Antebellum social etiquette also stipulated that a woman grieve her husband for roughly two and a half years, while the experience of war often led widows not only to stop mourning but to start rebuilding their lives (and finding other partners) far quicker. In the South, many women inherited large estates and numerous enslaved people upon their husbands' death, becoming solely responsible for maintaining operations and adopting the role of enslaver.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD64105P2'>Widows in both the North and South played outsized roles in commemorating the Civil War and deeply impacted the war's popular memory. Women were societally expected to remember their husbands as honorable, infusing that memory into the statuary and literature of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Antebellum social and legal practices also ensured that women were generally financially dependent upon their husbands, and widowhood thereby faced many women with poverty. Reform agencies therefore often targeted widows in their charitable work, and the widows themselves sought financial assistance from the federal government by applying for pensions, expanding the American welfare state. While widowhood existed prominently throughout the nineteenth century, the Civil War ultimately increased the number of widows and radically altered their places in American life (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the first military drafts occurred during the American Civil War, in which both the Union and Confederate governments issued conscription laws.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P1'>The Confederacy, receiving fewer enlistments than it expected at the beginning of the war, passed the First Conscription Act in April 1862, rendering all able-bodied white males between the ages of 18 and 35 eligible to be compelled into military service, but it included a provision by which a draftee could hire a substitute or obtain an exemption. Fearing insurrections by the enslaved population, the Confederacy passed a Second Conscription Act in September 1862 exempting one white enslaver for every twenty enslaved persons on a property, also known as the "Twenty Slave Law". Both the substitute and twenty slave laws isolated impoverished white southerners and rendered the draft deeply unpopular among non-elite southerners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P2'>In the North, conscription began in July 1862 when Congress authorized the president to enlist any militia company into the United States' service. Conscription extended to the general public in March 1863 with the Enrollment Act, rendering any able-bodied white male citizen or immigrant between the ages of 20 and 45 subject to the draft. This law similarly included a provision allowing one to purchase a substitute or commutation for the then-sizeable fee of $300. Draftees could also be exempt by proving that they were the sole support of family members or other dependents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P3'>Many individuals in the North and South saw their respective drafts as affronts to the freedom and individual liberties upon which the United States was founded, while tensions also arose between those of different races, ethnicities, religions, and social classes that were differently represented in the draft. The draft also brought home the realities of war to many families, North and South, who relied on men to support them, as fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers were sent to fight, where they would make the little money paid to soldiers and possibly lose their lives. Conscription in the American Civil War led to the violence of the New York Draft Riots of July 1863, and resulted in widespread and varied resistance in North and South (Bill of Rights Institute).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
