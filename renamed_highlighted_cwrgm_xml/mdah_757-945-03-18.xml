                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52703P0'>Joseph Eggleston Johnson was a career U.S. military officer who served as a general in the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P1'>Born near Farmville, Virginia, on February 3, 1807, Johnston attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduated in 1829. He served as a lieutenant with the Fourth U.S. Artillery in the early 1830s, eventually resigning in 1837 to pursue a career in civil engineering. After a short stint as a civilian engineer in Florida during the Second Seminole War, Johnston returned the U.S. Army and was soon after promoted to captain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P2'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Johnston served on the personal staff of General Winfield Scott. He performed very well during the war, seeing significant combat and receiving wounds at the Battle of Cerro Gordo and at Chapultepec. Army officials issued Johnston multiple brevet (honorary) promotions for his actions during the war, leading him to holding the rank of brevet colonel. (Brevet promotions were not formally recognized in regular Army service, and Johnston returned to the official rank of captain after the Mexican War ended in 1848.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P3'>During the 1850s, Johnston petitioned for a promotion to colonel in the regular Army based upon his brevet ranks. The U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, a fellow West Point graduate, rejected the petition, but did appoint Johnston a lieutenant colonel in the First U.S. Cavalry, stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. With this unit, Johnston saw field operations against Native Americans in Wyoming Territory and was present in territorial Kansas during the battle over slavery there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P4'>In 1860, when the Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army, Brigadier General Thomas Jesup, passed away, Secretary of War John B. Floyd selected Johnston as the replacement. The appointment included a promotion to brigadier general, placing Johnston above other notable Army officers of his generation, including future Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P5'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, and Virginia declared its secession from the Union, Johnston resigned his commission. As brigadier general, Johnston was the highest ranking U.S. Army officer to resign and join the Confederacy. He initially received an appointment as major general over the Virginia militia, but soon after learned that his position would be downgraded to brigadier general in favor of Robert E. Lee filling the state militia’s sole major general position. Johnston rejected the offer from the Virginia state government and instead accepted a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate States Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P6'>Johnston organized the Army of the Shenandoah in the spring of 1861, and was the highest ranking Confederate officer at the First Battle of Bull Run in July that year. However, he deferred to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, who was more familiar with the terrain and troop dispositions around Manassas, Virginia, and thus had less to do with Confederate actions during the engagement.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P7'>Johnston was promoted to full general in August 1861, but was upset that three of his pre-war colleagues outranked him in the Confederacy. This led to friction between Johnston and President Jefferson Davis for the rest of the war. Nevertheless, Johnston was placed in command of the Army of Northern Virginia, seen by many as the most important Confederate army due to its responsibilities of protecting the Confederate capital of Richmond from Union force. In the spring of 1862, Johnston conducted a strategic retreat toward Richmond in the face of Union General George B. McClellan’s Army of the Potomac. During the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, 1862, Johnston was wounded and removed the field for treatment. General Robert E. Lee was given command of the Army of Northern Virginia, and through his aggressive and successful attacks against McClellan, Lee retained command of that army for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P8'>In November 1862, Johnston recovered from the wound received at Seven Pines and received orders to the western theater. He had nominal command over Confederates in the region, but found he had little practical control over two large armies—one led by General John C. Pemberton and the other commanded by General Braxton Bragg—already involved in campaigns in Tennessee and Mississippi. In early 1863. Johnston attempted to gather reinforcements to support Pemberton in protecting Vicksburg from Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army. Grant’s army  won a series of engagements cutting off Vicksburg from Jackson, Mississippi, blocking Johnston from uniting with Pemberton. Johnston recommended that Pemberton abandon Vicksburg to prevent his army from being surrounded by Grant. News of this recommendation upset many Confederates, including Jefferson Davis, who recognized the value of Vicksburg to controlling the Mississippi River. Pemberton’s army was indeed surrounded and captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. Davis partially blamed the loss of Vicksburg on Johnston’s failure to aggressively reinforce Pemberton, leading to additional tensions between the Confederate president and Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P9'>A few weeks later, General Bragg resigned his command of the Army of Tennessee after losing to Union forces at Chattanooga. Despite Davis’s dislike of Johnston, the Confederacy had few generals experienced or capable of leading an army. He reluctantly placed Johnston in command of the Army of Tennessee in late December 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P10'>In the spring of 1864, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman launched a campaign from Chattanooga to capture the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Johnston led his Army of Tennessee in a series of maneuvers to block the Union army. Over the next several weeks, Sherman’s larger army repeatedly attacked and flanked the Confederates, prompting Johnston to conduct a strategic withdrawal back toward Atlanta, taking new defensive positions each time. Although Johnston’s methods slowed the Union advance and inflicted more casualties on Union forces than suffered by the Confederates, Johnston retreated 110 miles in two months and failed to stop Sherman’s threat to Atlanta. Frustrated by Johnston’s perceived lack of aggression, Davis relieved Johnston of command in July 1864. His replacement, John Bell Hood, launched bold attacks against Sherman but failed, and the Confederates had to abandon Atlanta in September 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P11'>Having lost command of the Army of Tennessee, Johnston went to South Carolina to sit out the rest of the war. However, as Confederate fortunes continued to fail, numerous political leaders called for Johnston to be reinstated. President Davis vehemently opposed the recommendation, having lost faith in Johnston. Only after Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens and numerous Confederate officials tried to circumvent Davis’s authority did the president acquiesce and order Johnston to field command. In February 1865, he received control of Confederate forces in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. He consolidated his troops, but the combined force amounted only to about 25,000 soldiers. Johnston hoped to unite his force with Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia, but Lee refused. A few weeks later, in mid-April 1865, Lee was defeated by Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia, and shortly afterwards Johnston’s Confederates were finally overwhelmed by Sherman’s Union soldiers in North Carolina. During negotiations with Sherman, Johnston formally surrendered all Confederate soldiers scattered across North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida—amounting, on paper, to nearly 90,000 Confederates. It was the largest surrender of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P12'>Federal forces paroled Johnston on May 2, 1865, allowing him to return to civilian life with the promise to not take up arms against the United States. He pursued various business interests, including serving as president of the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad, and working as an insurance agent for New York Life Insurance Company. Johnston also wrote his memoirs, voicing criticism of Jefferson Davis and many other former Confederates. On the other hand, he developed a strong friendship with his former adversary, William Tecumseh Sherman. Grateful for the generous terms of surrender and respect shown to him by Sherman at the end of the war, Johnston reportedly denounced anyone who spoke ill of Sherman in his presence, and served as an honorary pallbearer at Sherman’s funeral in New York City in February 1891. Johnston became sick immediately after the funeral—possibly from exposure to cold temperatures and rain during the procession—and died of pneumonia a month later, on March 21, 1891.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P13'>Johnston had been married to Lydia McLane Johnston. The couple had no children, and Lydia died in 1887. Both are buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

It was reinstated as the capital from 1817 until 1820, when the capital was again replaced by Washington (which was later replaced by the current capital Jackson in 1822). Natchez serves as the county seat. (Wikipedia; Britannica; Mississippi Encyclopedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
