                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS102404P0'>John Gill Shorter was governor of Alabama during the first half of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102404P1'>Born on April 23, 1818, in Monticello, Georgia, Shorter graduated from the University of Georgia in 1837 and then moved to Alabama, where his family had settled a few years earlier. The Shorters gradually purchased land in Barbour County, Alabama, becoming one of the wealthiest families in the area. Shorter became a practicing attorney and opened a successful law firm with a brother in Alabama.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102404P2'>In the early 1840s, Shorter became active in Democratic politics and in 1845 won a seat in the Alabama Senate. He served a single term, and then won a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives in 1851. However, he left the House before the end of his term when he received an appointment as circuit judge. He served as a judge through the 1850s, but continued to be involved in politics. Like most other southern leaders of the time, Shorter was strongly pro-slavery, advocating the institution’s expansion westward. He initially was not a vocal proponent of secession, but supported financial policies that boosted the south’s independence from the northern economy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102404P3'>When Abraham Lincoln won the presidential election in 1860, Shorter endorsed secession. The governor of Alabama, Andrew B. Moore, appointed Shorter a secession commissioner to Georgia, tasked with recruiting that state to secede and join a southern confederacy. He then won a seat in the Provisional Confederate Congress and helped write a constitution for the Confederate States of America. In August 1861, Shorter successfully ran for governor Alabama. Although he had long advocated states’ rights, the realities of war against a larger, more powerful Union led Shorter to adopt policies that countered his pre-war principles. He supported the Confederate government’s military draft, and he urged the Alabama legislature to pass a law that allowed him to impress slaves, from Alabama slaveowners, to work on state and military projects. These policies and other wartime events outraged many southerners, and resulted in Shorter’s popularity sharply declining while in office. He lost reelection in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102404P4'>After the expiration of his term, Shorter returned to his home in Eufaula, Alabama, and practiced law until he died on May 29, 1872. He was married to Mary Jane Battle. Shorter is buried in Shorter Cemetery in Eufala, Alabama.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

It was the state’s first prison and formally authorized by an act of the state legislature on January 26, 1839. In 1922 it was converted to exclusively house female prisoners until 1942 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The remaining structures were demolished by the end of the twentieth century. (Encyclopedia of Alabama; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).
