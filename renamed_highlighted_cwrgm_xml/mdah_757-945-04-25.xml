                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P0'>The act of beginning to fight or a period of time in a war, military engagements are also referred to as battles or skirmishes. Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P1'>There were approximately 10,500 engagements during the American Civil War. Fifty of them were major battles, while another one hundred were notable engagements. The rest were small battles or skirmishes. (Cambridge Dictionary; American Battlefield Trust)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005292P0'>The Siege of Vicksburg was fought from May 18 – July 4, 1863 between the Army of the Tennessee (Union) commanded by Major and General Ulysses S. Grant and the Army of Mississippi (Confederate) commanded by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton. It was the last engagement of the Vicksburg campaign and resulted in a decisive Union victory. The capture of New Orleans and Memphis in May and June of 1862 respectively gave the Union control of the upper and lower Mississippi River. However, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg prevented the Union from controlling the entirety of the river. Previous attempts to capture the city ended in failure.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32005292P1'>From May to June 1862 Union gunboats failed to destroy the Confederate artillery guarding the city and in December an assault under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was repulsed. The Union victory at the Battle of Jackson on May 14, 1863 and Gen. Joseph E. Johnston’s reluctance to bring his Army of Relief to battle against Grant’s forces prevented any possibility of relief for Vicksburg. On May 19 and 22, Grant attempted two additional assaults, which ended in failure and prompted him to invest the city and begin a siege. At this point, the battle became one of attrition. On June 25 Union sappers detonated 2,200 pounds of black powder in a tunnel dug under a section of the defensive earthworks, creating a large crater. Union troops poured into the crater but were repelled after a 26-hour fight with Confederate defenders. With his army dangerously low on rations and on the brink of starvation, Pemberton surrendered Vicksburg on July 4, 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32005292P2'>The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 110,000; 77,000 Union and 33,000 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 37,273 with 4,910 Union and 32,363 Confederate (29,620 missing and captured). The fall of Vicksburg and the surrender of Port Hudson, Louisiana five days later on July 9, dealt a serious blow to the Confederacy. It gave the Union uncontested control of the Mississippi River and separated Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas from the rest of the Confederacy.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25018595P0'>Rooted in the Lieber Code and other military customs, Union and Confederate militaries were expected to acknowledge surrendering enemies and treat them as prisoners of war who could then be imprisoned, paroled, and/or exchanged. Historically, European practices held that prisoners of war could be released if they swore an oath not to bear arms against those who captured them until they were exchanged for an enemy soldier.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018595P1'>Mimicking European practices, in 1862 Union and Confederate militaries developed, what historian Caroline E. Janney describes as "an elaborate prison cartel system." (Caroline E. Janney, <hi rend='italic'>Ends of War: The Unfinished Fight of Lee's Army after Appomattox</hi>, p. 25) In July of that year, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Union Maj. Gen. John A Dix to negotiated formal prisoner exchange arrangements with Confederate representative, Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill. (David Silkenat, "How Civil War Soldiers Viewed Surrender," H-Net) Under this system, captured uniformed soldiers were typically paroled and exchanged because neither the Union or the Confederacy wanted to expend the manpower and funds on maintaining large numbers of captured enemy soldiers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018595P2'>Under the Dix-Hill cartel, "Union paroled prisoners were held in their own army’s parole camps until exchanged, while Confederates went home to await exchange." (Silkenat, "How Civil War Soldiers Viewed Surrender") Consequently, paroles depended almost entirely on soldiers upholding their oaths not to resume fighting until they had been exchanged for an equivalent number of prisoners from the other side. Those who violated the terms of their parole faced recapture or execution. (Janney, <hi rend='italic'>Ends of War</hi>, p. 25; Silkenat, "How Civil War Soldiers Viewed Surrender")
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018595P3'>After the summer of 1863, the Union and Confederacy accused one another of violating the terms of their parol. Furthermore, the Confederacy announced they would not treat captured African American soldiers as prisoners of war but instead as fugitive slaves. Consequently, the prisoner exchange system broke down. The number of paroles decreased dramatically, and the Dix-Hill cartel was replaced by prisoner of war camps like Andersonville, where captured white enemy combatants were housed under poor conditions for the duration of the war. For those African American soldiers who surrendered to the Confederate forces, they faced enslavement, re-enslavement, and death, such as the massacre of Black troops at Ft. Pillow. (Silkenat, "How Civil War Soldiers Viewed Surrender")

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013738P0'>An annual national holiday celebrated on the forth day of July, Independence Day celebrates the anniversary of the Second Continental Congress' ratification of the Declaration of Independence, the document which signaled the American colonies' separation from Great Britain. Following the American Civil War, Union veterans connected their Civil War military service to Independence Day celebrations as the the foremost important events in the nation's history to elevate their contemporary status and importance in U.S. history. Consequently, the Fourth of July became an important commemorative date for remembering the Civil War. (Stuart McConnel, <hi rend='italic'>Glorious Contentment</hi>, 85)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013738P1'>Relatedly, the Fourth of July was also celebrated in former Confederate states but almost exclusively by Black Americans. Freed people frequently celebrated the end of slavery on Independence Day, and in the process they cemented the importance of emancipation to the nation's history and it became a space for celebrating Black social, political, and economic accomplishment. However, in numerous instances white racist violence erupted in response to public celebrations of emancipation. Typically, white attendees became angered by Black celebrations of their freedom, which were tied to demands for racial equality. This resulted in violence, such as a race riot on the Fourth of July in Leavenworth, Kansas in 1865. (Wikipedia; "Emancipation Day Once Black Community's July 4th," McLean County Museum of History; Susan T. Falk, <hi rend='italic'>Remembering Dixie</hi>, 65; Brent M.S. Campney, <hi rend='italic'>This Is Not Dixie</hi>, 25)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
