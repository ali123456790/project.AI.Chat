                    <p xml:id='OTPS97207P0'>John C. Pemberton was a Confederate general, most famous for commanding troops in the unsuccessful defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P1'>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 10, 1814, Pemberton was raised and educated in the north. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837, and immediately afterwards served as a U.S. artillery officer in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He remained a professional soldier for the next two decades, serving at various forts and posts in the United States, along the Canadian border, and in the west. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Pemberton served with the 4th U.S. Artillery and took part in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de La Palma, and Monterrey. He earned the brevet (honorary) rank of captain for his actions at Monterrey. He continued to serve with distinction at several other engagements in Mexico, including the storming of Chapultepec castle and the battle at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P2'>In 1848, following the Mexican-American War, Pemberton married Martha Thompson of Virginia. The couple had one daughter and three sons, all born in the 1850s. Pemberton continued to serve at a variety of posts in the United States, and saw additional action in Florida against the Seminoles from 1849 to 1850, and then again from 1856 to 1857. After spending a year in New Mexico Territory and three years in Minnesota, Pemberton was sent to Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1861, in the midst of the secession crisis. Despite his northern upbringing, Pemberton resigned his commission from the United States Army when the Civil War erupted in April 1861. He immediately volunteered for Confederate service and received an appointment as assistant adjutant general of Confederate forces at Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P3'>Because of his lengthy military experience, Pemberton rose quickly in Confederate ranks, reaching major general in January 1862. He was placed in command of the military department defending Georgia and South Carolina, but soon ran into conflict with the states’ governors who objected to Pemberton's assertion that the survival of his army was more important than defending the region, and due to mistrust of his northern heritage. Confederate President Jefferson Davis placed the more popular General P. G. T. Beauregard in charge of the defense of Georgia and South Carolina and relocated Pemberton to a new military department in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P4'>At his new assignment in Mississippi, in the fall of 1862, Pemberton received the promotion to lieutenant general. He was responsible for defending the Mississippi River and key port towns, such as Vicksburg, from federal attack. Unlike the more famous Confederate armies to the east, Pemberton’s command was made up of southern troops who had suffered several defeats against aggressive Union commanders at battles like Shiloh and Corinth. Many of Pemberton’s troops were separated, and he struggled to unite his force to stage an effective defense against Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army, which began a campaign for Vicksburg in December 1862. Making matters worse for the Confederate general, his orders were to hold Vicksburg at all cost—meaning that he had limited ability to maneuver or even withdraw to save his army in the face of Grant’s larger force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P5'>Between December 1862 and July 1863, Grant conducted a slow, creative, but ultimately persistent campaign to surround and capture Vicksburg. Utilizing his aggressive subordinate William T. Sherman, Grant cut Pemberton and his Confederate troops off at Vicksburg and burned Mississippi’s capital of Jackson in May 1863. After being besieged in Vicksburg by Grant’s troops for six weeks, Pemberton realized he had no other choice but to surrender. On July 4, 1863, Pemberton ordered his army to lay down its arms and open Vicksburg to Grant’s army. The defeat occurred one day after Robert E. Lee’s battlefield loss at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, delivering a double blow to Confederate morale.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P6'>Pemberton and his men were captured and paroled by Union forces—a practice by which prisoners were allowed to return home or to encampments under the sworn oath not to take up arms until formally exchanged for Union prisoners. Pemberton traveled to Richmond where he remained idle for several months. Not receiving a new assignment, he resigned his general’s commission in May 1864. President Davis offered him a conciliatory assignment as a lieutenant colonel of artillery, which he accepted. He temporarily commanded the artillery defense of Richmond before taking an appointment as inspector general of artillery. Pemberton was captured by Union troops in mid-April 1865 during the final days of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97207P7'>Following the Civil War, Pemberton moved to Warrenton, Virginia. He remained there until 1876, when he moved back to Pennsylvania. He lived quietly on a farm, passing away in 1881. Pemberton is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS93380P0'>Wiley Pope Harris was a U.S. congressman from Mississippi in the 1850s and a representative in the Confederate Congress.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS93380P1'>Born in Pike County, Mississippi, on November 9, 1818, Harris attended the University of Virginia and then received a law degree from Transylvania College in Lexington, Kentucky. He began practicing law in 1840 in Gallatin, Mississippi, and within four years took a seat as circuit judge for the state’s second district. In 1850 Harris participated in Mississippi’s constitutional convention, and in 1852 was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served one term and then returned to law practice in Jackson, Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS93380P2'>When Mississippi declared its separation from the Union in 1861 and joined the Confederacy, Harris secured a seat in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States of America. Following the Civil War, he resumed practicing law. Harris died on December 3, 1891. He was married to Frances Mayes and had seven children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52585P0'>Daniel Ruggles was a Confederate general during the Civil War. Born in Barre, Massachusetts, on January 31, 1810, Ruggles grew up in the north and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating from West Point in 1833, he served at a variety of U.S. Army posts in the west and south, and participated in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He was promoted to captain in 1846, during the Mexican-American War, and fought in several battles, including at Vera Cruz, Chapultepec, and Mexico City. He remained in the army during the 1850s, taking part in a military campaign against Mormon settlers over governance of Utah Territory, before taking leave due to health reasons.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P1'>When the Civil War erupted in early 1861, Ruggles resigned his commission. Although he was from Massachusetts, he had married Richardetta Barnes Mason Hooe, from Virginia, and sympathized with the secessionist cause. He received a commission with the Virginia militia and assisted in the defense of Chesapeake Bay from U.S. Navy activity. Appointed brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the summer of 1861, Ruggles was sent to command a brigade in General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Pensacola. He had been placed in charge of a division within Bragg’s army when it moved into Mississippi to join General Albert Sidney Johnston’s Army of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P2'>On April 6, 1862, Johnston’s Confederates attacked Union soldiers under Ulysses S. Grant at Pittsburgh Landing along the Tennessee River in southwest Tennessee. The battle became more popularly known as Shiloh, due to a nearby church by that name. The Confederate assault was initially successful, pushing the Union soldiers back toward the river. However, some federal troops managed to hold a defensive position against repeated attacks. The scene was called the ”Hornets Nest” due to the intensity of the fighting. Ruggles called for every Confederate cannon to assemble and fire into the Union position. The result was a line of 62 Confederate cannons—the largest concentration of artillery in North America at the time—nicknamed “Ruggles’s Battery,” firing for hours into the “Hornets Nest” until the Union soldiers retreated. Despite the Confederate success the first day, Albert Sidney Johnston was mortally wounded and Grant’s troops rallied the following day to force the southern soldiers back, resulting in a Union victory.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P3'>Following Shiloh, Ruggles battled Union soldiers in Mississippi and Louisiana. He participated in an unsuccessful campaign to recapture Baton Rouge from federal forces and a failed Confederate attempt to secure the town of Corinth, Mississippi. Although southern defeats, Ruggles had performed well. He spent the rest of the war in administrative positions, including being appointed head of the prison system, overseeing the final exchange of Union prisoners when the war ended.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52585P4'>After the Civil War, Ruggles moved to Virginia where he took up farming and real estate business. He died in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on June 1, 1897, and is buried in the Confederate City in that town.  He and his wife Richardetta had four sons, three of which survived to adulthood.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS79911P0'>William Murphy Inge was a Confederate officer and Mississippi state legislator after the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS79911P1'>Born on February 22, 1832, in Greene County, Alabama, Inge moved to Aberdeen, Mississippi, with his family as a child. He reportedly attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, for a short time, but did not graduate. Inge studied law and was a practicing attorney in Mississippi when the Civil War broke out. He volunteered for military service and was commissioned a captain in the Ninth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. The unit was sent to Pensacola, Florida, where it sat in garrison. Impatient with the lack of action, Inge resigned and traveled to Virginia to be more involved in the Confederate war effort. He became an adjutant in the Twelfth Mississippi Infantry Regiment in the eastern theater and then briefly served as a staff officer under Brigadier General William Barksdale of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS79911P2'>In early 1863, Inge relocated to Mississippi where he took command of the Twelfth Mississippi Partisan Rangers, a home defense cavalry unit. He conducted raids against federal units in Mississippi and then in Georgia against William Tecumseh Sherman’s army during its campaign from Atlanta to Savannah. In 1865, he helped organize the Tenth Mississippi Cavalry and served as its colonel until the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS79911P3'>Following the Civil War, Inge returned to practicing law. In 1882, shortly after the end of Reconstruction, he was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives, and in 1884 he was elected Speaker of the House in that body. He retired from politics in 1886 and died on November 26, 1900, in Corinth, Mississippi. Inge was married to Augusta Evans and had at least five children, three of whom lived to adulthood. He is buried in Henry Cemetery in Corinth, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63158P0'>Samuel J. Gholson was a U.S. representative, U.S. district judge, and Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P1'>Born in Richmond, Kentucky, on May 19, 1808, Gholson spent much of his boyhood in Alabama. He began practicing law in Russellville, Alabama, in 1829 and shortly afterwards opened a law office in Athens, Mississippi. In 1835, he won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives. The following year, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi as a Democrat. He served until 1838, when his seat was declared vacant. In 1839, he received an appointment to a joint seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District and for the Southern District of Mississippi. Gholson served in that capacity until 1861, when Mississippi seceded. He had been a delegate to the state’s secession convention, following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory as president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P2'>Gholson volunteered for Confederate military service. Although enlisting as a private, due to his age and standing as a public official, he was quickly promoted, eventually rising to major general of Mississippi state troops in 1863. Gholson campaigned in the field during his military service, being present at the battles of Fort Donelson, Iuka, and Corinth in 1862. In 1864, he received a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate army and placed in command of cavalry troops. He was badly wounded in the arm and captured during the Battle of Egypt Station in December 1864. His injuries were so severe that Union officers reported him to be mortally wounded. In fact, Gholson survived the wound, but his arm had to be amputated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P3'>Gholson was released by Union forces in May 1865, after the war had ended. He immediately returned to state politics, winning a seat in the legislature that year. He served as the speaker of the house from 1865 to 1866, and then agitated against Republican Reconstruction over the next several years. He won election to the state legislature one more time, in 1878. Gholson died in 1883 and is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi. He had been married to Margraten Ann Ragsdale, but the couple had no surviving children.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P0'>During the American Civil War, to disband a military unit was to formally dissolve it. Once dissolved, soldiers returned to their state capitals to deposit their weapons and other publicly owned property. Units were disbanded for a number of reasons throughout the war, including the end of their service agreement and surrender. Frequently, officers disbanded a unit with diminished strength and reorganized it to form a full strength unit. As the Lieber Code did not recognize un-uniformed guerrilla fighters, it was also common for leaders of guerrilla units, like Confederate Col. John Singleton Mosby, to disband their command rather than formally surrender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P1'>Following Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in April 1864, the enormous process of demobilizing all Confederate armies began. The terms for disbanding Confederate military units Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant offered Lee were mimicked by other Union commanders. Rather that disbanding the men without any restraints, Grant classified them as paroled prisoners of war, which would legally forbid them for taking up arms against the United States again.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P0'>By 1862 the initial waves of men who enlisted into Confederate military service diminished as enthusiasm for the war diminished, and both the Union and Confederacy enacted drafts to fill their armies. Nearly one year before the Union (March 1863), the Confederacy instituted a national draft in April 1862. There were important social implications to this policy, especially within the exemptions the Union and Confederacy provided. Similar to the Union, the Confederate act allowed drafted men to hire substitutes to serve in their place (often lower-class men willing to serve for much-needed income) and excused men from military service for medical reasons, "workers deemed necessary to maintain society," including select government employees. And unlike the Union, beginning in October 1862, men who enslaved a minimum of twenty (later fifteen) people were exempt.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P1'>The Twenty-Slave Law exemption was a reaction to President Abraham Lincoln's recent announcement of the<lb/>
Emancipation Proclamation. While many southern whites worried about enslaved people uprising with so many white men away at war, these policies cultivated a feeling among impoverished people that they were doing the majority of fighting and suffering for a “rich man's war.” Scholars like Joseph Glathaar proved this was not the case in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia where the wealthy were overrepresented compared with impoverished soldiers, but it is unclear if this was the case in areas like Mississippi, and the perception of unfair protections for the wealthy fueled resentment.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
