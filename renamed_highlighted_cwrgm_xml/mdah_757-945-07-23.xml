                    <p xml:id='OTPS63158P0'>Samuel J. Gholson was a U.S. representative, U.S. district judge, and Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P1'>Born in Richmond, Kentucky, on May 19, 1808, Gholson spent much of his boyhood in Alabama. He began practicing law in Russellville, Alabama, in 1829 and shortly afterwards opened a law office in Athens, Mississippi. In 1835, he won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives. The following year, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi as a Democrat. He served until 1838, when his seat was declared vacant. In 1839, he received an appointment to a joint seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District and for the Southern District of Mississippi. Gholson served in that capacity until 1861, when Mississippi seceded. He had been a delegate to the state’s secession convention, following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory as president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P2'>Gholson volunteered for Confederate military service. Although enlisting as a private, due to his age and standing as a public official, he was quickly promoted, eventually rising to major general of Mississippi state troops in 1863. Gholson campaigned in the field during his military service, being present at the battles of Fort Donelson, Iuka, and Corinth in 1862. In 1864, he received a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate army and placed in command of cavalry troops. He was badly wounded in the arm and captured during the Battle of Egypt Station in December 1864. His injuries were so severe that Union officers reported him to be mortally wounded. In fact, Gholson survived the wound, but his arm had to be amputated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P3'>Gholson was released by Union forces in May 1865, after the war had ended. He immediately returned to state politics, winning a seat in the legislature that year. He served as the speaker of the house from 1865 to 1866, and then agitated against Republican Reconstruction over the next several years. He won election to the state legislature one more time, in 1878. Gholson died in 1883 and is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi. He had been married to Margraten Ann Ragsdale, but the couple had no surviving children.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS79911P0'>William Murphy Inge was a Confederate officer and Mississippi state legislator after the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS79911P1'>Born on February 22, 1832, in Greene County, Alabama, Inge moved to Aberdeen, Mississippi, with his family as a child. He reportedly attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, for a short time, but did not graduate. Inge studied law and was a practicing attorney in Mississippi when the Civil War broke out. He volunteered for military service and was commissioned a captain in the Ninth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. The unit was sent to Pensacola, Florida, where it sat in garrison. Impatient with the lack of action, Inge resigned and traveled to Virginia to be more involved in the Confederate war effort. He became an adjutant in the Twelfth Mississippi Infantry Regiment in the eastern theater and then briefly served as a staff officer under Brigadier General William Barksdale of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS79911P2'>In early 1863, Inge relocated to Mississippi where he took command of the Twelfth Mississippi Partisan Rangers, a home defense cavalry unit. He conducted raids against federal units in Mississippi and then in Georgia against William Tecumseh Sherman’s army during its campaign from Atlanta to Savannah. In 1865, he helped organize the Tenth Mississippi Cavalry and served as its colonel until the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS79911P3'>Following the Civil War, Inge returned to practicing law. In 1882, shortly after the end of Reconstruction, he was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives, and in 1884 he was elected Speaker of the House in that body. He retired from politics in 1886 and died on November 26, 1900, in Corinth, Mississippi. Inge was married to Augusta Evans and had at least five children, three of whom lived to adulthood. He is buried in Henry Cemetery in Corinth, Mississippi.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS48994P0'>Gideon Johnson Pillow was a general in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War and later served as a general for the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P1'>Born June 8, 1806, in Williamson County, Tennessee, Pillow grew up in Tennessee and graduated from the University of Nashville in 1827. He entered the legal profession in Columbia, Tennessee, becoming partners with future-president James K. Polk. In the early 1830s, Pillow’s public standing increased as he received an appointment as a district attorney general in Tennessee and received a commission as a brigadier general in the Tennessee Militia. His future was further boosted by the election of his friend James K. Polk as U.S. president in 1844.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P2'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Polk appointed Pillow a brigadier general. He led troops in several battles, and was wounded at both Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. Pillow was promoted to major general in 1847, but soon ran into conflict with Major General Winfield Scott when the latter accused Pillow exaggerating his role at various engagements—a charge supported by the fact that Pillow likely wrote an anonymous letter to a New Orleans newspaper crediting himself with the American battle victories at Contreras and Churubusco. When Scott arrested Pillow for insubordination and violating military regulations, Pillow wrote to President Polk with accusations that Scott had tried to bribe Mexican leader Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to end the war. In response, Polk relieved Scott of command of U.S. forces in Mexico in February 1848. The matter was eventually settled with Pillow’s charges dropped and Scott reinstated as general-in-chief of the army, but critics of Pillow—including Scott—argued that he was self-serving and willing to lie for personal gain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P3'>Pillow returned to Tennessee after the Mexican-American War and became involved in politics during the 1850s. He attended the 1850 Nashville Convention, which was a meeting among southern leaders to discuss possible responses if the federal government prohibited slavery in territories won from Mexico in the recent war. Some delegates proposed secession, but Pillow and a majority of the other attendees opposed disunion and supported a compromise with the north. Pillow was active in Democratic politics, unsuccessfully vying to be a vice presidential candidate in 1852 and 1856, as well as a failed bid to secure a seat in the U.S. Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P4'>Pillow supported Tennessee when the state declared itself seceded from the Union at the outbreak of the Civil War. He received a commission as a major general in the state’s militia, and then in July 1861 received an appointment as brigadier general in the Confederate army. In September 1861, under orders from Major General Leonidas Polk, Pillow led Confederate troops into Kentucky as an effort to secure that state for the Confederacy. The move proved to be a monumental blunder, as the Kentucky government and many of its citizens saw the incursion as an assault upon their state’s neutrality, thereby securing Kentucky for the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P5'>Pillow gained some fame in the Confederacy following the Battle of Belmont in December 1861, when his force held off an attack by Ulysses S. Grant. He was then placed in command of Confederate troops at Fort Donelson in February 1862, where he led a successful attack to break out of the fort before Grant’s entire force could surround it. Despite achieving that initial objective, Pillow inexplicably withdrew his soldiers for resupply, allowing Union forces to close the gap. With defeat inevitable, Pillow passed command of the fort to a subordinate and escaped before the Confederates surrendered.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P6'>The events at Fort Donelson marred Pillow’s reputation, and he was briefly suspended from command by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. However, in December 1862, Pillow received another chance at command when he was placed in charge of a brigade within the Army of Tennessee under General Braxton Bragg. During the Battle of Murfreesboro, December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863, Pillow reportedly hid behind a tree while his brigade participated in an assault. Receiving criticism for his performance, Pillow was removed from field command and placed in charge of recruiting and conscription for the Army of Tennessee. During the final months of the war he served as Commissary General of Prisoners, before surrendering to Union forces in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P7'>Pillow, who had been one of the wealthiest landowners in Tennessee in 1860, was bankrupt after the war. He rebuilt some of his wealth with a successful law practice in Memphis with former Tennessee governor Isham G. Harris. He died of yellow fever on October 8, 1878, in Arkansas. Pillow had been married twice, first to Mary Martin (who died in 1869) and then to Mary Eliza Dickson (who was forty years his junior). Pillow had eleven children with his first wife and three with his second wife. Pillow is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P0'>During the American Civil War, to disband a military unit was to formally dissolve it. Once dissolved, soldiers returned to their state capitals to deposit their weapons and other publicly owned property. Units were disbanded for a number of reasons throughout the war, including the end of their service agreement and surrender. Frequently, officers disbanded a unit with diminished strength and reorganized it to form a full strength unit. As the Lieber Code did not recognize un-uniformed guerrilla fighters, it was also common for leaders of guerrilla units, like Confederate Col. John Singleton Mosby, to disband their command rather than formally surrender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P1'>Following Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in April 1864, the enormous process of demobilizing all Confederate armies began. The terms for disbanding Confederate military units Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant offered Lee were mimicked by other Union commanders. Rather that disbanding the men without any restraints, Grant classified them as paroled prisoners of war, which would legally forbid them for taking up arms against the United States again.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32123713P0'>At the start of the American Civil War, military authorities in the Union and Confederacy activated old militia companies, or created new volunteer companies, throughout their respective states. Some companies remained as home guard units under state government authority, while many others were activated for national service and combined with other companies into regiments, which were the standard independent military unit on the Civil War battlefield. Comprised of ten companies, each with one hundred men, a full-strength regiment consisted of one thousand soldiers. Because most regiments were raised at the state level, they typically carried the name of their state as well as a number (that generally indicated their sequence of organization), such as the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123713P1'>While the early-war command structure varied, eventually Union and Confederate armies used a system that placed two or more regiments into a brigade. Two or more brigades made a division. Above that, two or more divisions would be placed into a corps, and two or more corps would make up an army. Because of the size and scope of the Civil War, the Union and Confederacy had multiple armies, spread across different states or military theaters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123713P2'>When activated for national service, state regiments had little control over where they were sent. Many units, especially from the Deep South—far from the initial war front—found themselves transferred far from their home areas and away from other units from their state. For instance, the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment and the 11th Mississippi Infantry Regiment were both organized in the spring of 1861 from volunteers around Corinth, Mississippi. The 9th Mississippi was first sent to Florida, then transferred to Tennessee, while the 11th Mississippi was ordered to Virginia upon activation for Confederate service. Regiments, and sometimes brigades or divisions, could see multiple transfers to fill gaps in other armies, or to create new commands as Union and Confederate armies enlarged. Subsequent transfers of units to new commands were more common in the western theaters, where fighting took place over a larger geographical area, forcing military authorities to more frequently divide or detach their available forces.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
