                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63316P0'>Beriah Magoffin was an attorney and politician who served as governor of Kentucky during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P1'>Born on April 18, 1815, in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, Magoffin graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, in 1835 before receiving a law degree from Transylvania University in 1838. He moved to Mississippi immediately afterwards and soon became the reading clerk for the Mississippi Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P2'>In 1839, Magoffin returned to Kentucky, reportedly due to an illness. He opened a law firm in Harrodsburg and the next year received an appointment as police judge. By the mid-1840s he was active in Democratic Party politics. He served as an elector in four consecutive presidential elections (1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856), and was elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1848, 1856, and 1860. He served a single term in the Kentucky Senate in 1850 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives and lieutenant governor of Kentucky in the 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P3'>Despite his political defeats, Magoffin won Kentucky’s 1859 gubernatorial election. He championed the institution of slavery and joined other southern politicians in defending states’ rights over federal authority, including the right of secession. However, during the secession crisis that erupted after Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Magoffin advocated moderation to southern secessionists. He offered a compromise plan which, among other ideas, recommended that the northern states repeal all laws that hindered the Fugitive Slave Act and that protected slavery in the southern half of the western territories (both major elements of previous compromises, including the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Compromise of 1850). Magoffin’s proposal was rejected by other southern governors and failed to stem the drive toward secession.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P4'>In January 1861, Magoffin called Kentucky’s legislature into session to organize a convention over the state’s future in the Union. The largely pro-Union legislature rejected his call. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Magoffin condemned Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the secessionists. However, the governor also respected his fellow Kentuckians’ opposition to secession, and rejected overtures by the Confederate government. In May 1861, Kentucky’s legislature passed a resolution declaring the state officially neutral. Magoffin honored the decision and sent letters to both President Lincoln and the Confederate president Jefferson Davis, requesting the two opposing sides of the Civil War recognize Kentucky as a neutral entity.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P5'>As the war progressed, Kentucky’s Unionists won additional state elections. Magoffin, still influenced by mild Confederate sympathies, vetoed several congressional bills, but the majority pro-Union legislature overrode many of them. Late in 1861, Confederate and Union armies marched into Kentucky. Magoffin attempted to condemn both sides, but the state legislature passed a bill denouncing only the Confederate incursion. Magoffin vetoed the bill, which was promptly overridden.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P6'>Facing constant opposition in office, Magoffin offered to resign from the governor’s office in the summer of 1862 if he could pick his replacement (as the lieutenant governor’s position had been vacant since 1859). Kentucky Unionists agreed. He selected James F. Robinson, who was in turn elected speaker of the house by the Unionists and placed in the line of succession. True to his word, Magoffin then resigned on August 18, 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P7'>Magoffin returned to practicing law. After the Civil War he proved very successful in real estate in Chicago, Illinois. He returned to political office in the late 1860s, serving in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1867 to 1869. He argued in favor of the Thirteenth Amendment and for the protection of African American civil rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63316P8'>Magoffin died on February 28, 1855. He was married to Anna Shelby and had at least ten children. He is buried in Spring Hill Cemetery in Harrodsburg, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS48994P0'>Gideon Johnson Pillow was a general in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War and later served as a general for the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P1'>Born June 8, 1806, in Williamson County, Tennessee, Pillow grew up in Tennessee and graduated from the University of Nashville in 1827. He entered the legal profession in Columbia, Tennessee, becoming partners with future-president James K. Polk. In the early 1830s, Pillow’s public standing increased as he received an appointment as a district attorney general in Tennessee and received a commission as a brigadier general in the Tennessee Militia. His future was further boosted by the election of his friend James K. Polk as U.S. president in 1844.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P2'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Polk appointed Pillow a brigadier general. He led troops in several battles, and was wounded at both Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. Pillow was promoted to major general in 1847, but soon ran into conflict with Major General Winfield Scott when the latter accused Pillow exaggerating his role at various engagements—a charge supported by the fact that Pillow likely wrote an anonymous letter to a New Orleans newspaper crediting himself with the American battle victories at Contreras and Churubusco. When Scott arrested Pillow for insubordination and violating military regulations, Pillow wrote to President Polk with accusations that Scott had tried to bribe Mexican leader Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to end the war. In response, Polk relieved Scott of command of U.S. forces in Mexico in February 1848. The matter was eventually settled with Pillow’s charges dropped and Scott reinstated as general-in-chief of the army, but critics of Pillow—including Scott—argued that he was self-serving and willing to lie for personal gain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P3'>Pillow returned to Tennessee after the Mexican-American War and became involved in politics during the 1850s. He attended the 1850 Nashville Convention, which was a meeting among southern leaders to discuss possible responses if the federal government prohibited slavery in territories won from Mexico in the recent war. Some delegates proposed secession, but Pillow and a majority of the other attendees opposed disunion and supported a compromise with the north. Pillow was active in Democratic politics, unsuccessfully vying to be a vice presidential candidate in 1852 and 1856, as well as a failed bid to secure a seat in the U.S. Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P4'>Pillow supported Tennessee when the state declared itself seceded from the Union at the outbreak of the Civil War. He received a commission as a major general in the state’s militia, and then in July 1861 received an appointment as brigadier general in the Confederate army. In September 1861, under orders from Major General Leonidas Polk, Pillow led Confederate troops into Kentucky as an effort to secure that state for the Confederacy. The move proved to be a monumental blunder, as the Kentucky government and many of its citizens saw the incursion as an assault upon their state’s neutrality, thereby securing Kentucky for the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P5'>Pillow gained some fame in the Confederacy following the Battle of Belmont in December 1861, when his force held off an attack by Ulysses S. Grant. He was then placed in command of Confederate troops at Fort Donelson in February 1862, where he led a successful attack to break out of the fort before Grant’s entire force could surround it. Despite achieving that initial objective, Pillow inexplicably withdrew his soldiers for resupply, allowing Union forces to close the gap. With defeat inevitable, Pillow passed command of the fort to a subordinate and escaped before the Confederates surrendered.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P6'>The events at Fort Donelson marred Pillow’s reputation, and he was briefly suspended from command by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. However, in December 1862, Pillow received another chance at command when he was placed in charge of a brigade within the Army of Tennessee under General Braxton Bragg. During the Battle of Murfreesboro, December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863, Pillow reportedly hid behind a tree while his brigade participated in an assault. Receiving criticism for his performance, Pillow was removed from field command and placed in charge of recruiting and conscription for the Army of Tennessee. During the final months of the war he served as Commissary General of Prisoners, before surrendering to Union forces in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P7'>Pillow, who had been one of the wealthiest landowners in Tennessee in 1860, was bankrupt after the war. He rebuilt some of his wealth with a successful law practice in Memphis with former Tennessee governor Isham G. Harris. He died of yellow fever on October 8, 1878, in Arkansas. Pillow had been married twice, first to Mary Martin (who died in 1869) and then to Mary Eliza Dickson (who was forty years his junior). Pillow had eleven children with his first wife and three with his second wife. Pillow is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94830P0'>Artillery, also known as cannons, are weapons that fire projectiles for longer ranges than small arms carried by infantry soldiers. The term artillery is also used to describe units, or the branch of service within the army, that operate cannons. During the Civil War, the most common artillery pieces were mounted on wheels and were capable of being transported by horses for deployment in battle. Called “field artillery,” these relatively small cannons were intended to inflict damage on enemy troops and light defensive positions. When mobility was not necessary, such as with fixed fortifications, artillery units used much heavier cannons with greater range and destructive power. Coastal defenses especially relied upon large artillery pieces to guard against heavily armed naval vessels.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P1'>Because the Confederacy did not have the same quantity and quality of manufacturing capabilities as northern states, the Confederate army heavily relied upon captured Union cannons and ammunition to outfit its artillery units. A shortage of guns meant that Confederate artillery batteries (the smallest individual artillery unit) typically consisted of four cannons, often of mixed calibers. This differed from Union batteries which fielded six guns of the same caliber. Shortages also limited Confederate artillery training, leading many people—even in the South—to believe that Confederate artillery capabilities were inferior to those of the Union army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P2'>Initially, Confederate artillery batteries were individually attached to infantry brigades. However, during the latter half of the war, military officials created artillery battalions of three or four batteries each to better combine artillery firepower for infantry divisions. Nevertheless, Confederate artillery officers, such as the chief of artillery for the Army of Northern Virginia Brigadier General William N. Pendleton, found it exceedingly difficult to draw together battalions for mass artillery fire during fast moving and broad battle fronts. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P0'>The term cavalry referred to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of Civil War armies, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies typically used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P1'>Confederate cavalrymen enjoyed a reputation of superiority over their Union counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that Confederate cavalry soldiers often had to provide their own horses (something less common in the Union army) and therefore were more experienced and comfortable with their steeds. Two other theories are that Southern aristocratic culture placed higher value on horsemanship than northern communities, and that men who grew up in the South’s largely agricultural society were more familiar with horses than those from the industrial North. All of these explanations may have some merit, but exaggerate the differences between North and South, and cannot account for any great disparity in cavalry actions within the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P2'>More important reasons for Confederate cavalry’s positive reputation included some high-profile leaders and notable early war victories. J.E.B. Stuart’s battlefield success in the Eastern Theater during the first two years, coupled with his flamboyant style, made him and his horse soldiers celebrities in the South, while other cavalry commanders, like John Hunt Morgan, John Singleton Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, used aggressive and rapid cavalry raids to disrupt northern supply lines, defeat isolated federal troops, and generally tie up exponentially larger Union forces. Despite these early and famous Confederate successes, Union cavalry forces improved in quality and quantity during the course of the war, culminating in a fight to a draw at Brandy Station—the largest cavalry battle in North America—in June 1863. During the last two years of the war, Confederate cavalry did not enjoy its reputation of dominance, although it still managed to play a large role in scouting, raiding, and resisting Union forces.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
