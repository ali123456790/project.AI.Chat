                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS73484P0'>Jacob Thompson was a U.S. politician and then a Confederate official, including the leader of secret plots against the north, during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P1'>Born on May 15, 1810, in Leasburg, North Carolina, Thompson graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1831 and afterwards briefly taught there before studying law. He moved to Mississippi and became a practicing attorney in 1834. Thompson showed interest in public and political office as early as 1837, when he unsuccessfully sought the office of Mississippi attorney general. Only two years later he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served until 1851.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P2'>Thompson returned to Mississippi after the end of his last Congressional term and practiced law. He turned down an appointment to U.S. Consul to Havana, Cuba, in 1853 and then lost an 1855 U.S. Senate election to Jefferson Davis. In 1857, he accepted an appointment as U.S. Secretary of the Interior under President James Buchanan. He served in that capacity during the contentious debate over the future of slavery in the territories during the late 1850s. Thompson initially took a moderate position, arguing against northern anti-slavery agitators and southern extremists who threatened secessionists. However, he sided with the lower south following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory, and became a secession commissioner from Mississippi and went to North Carolina to encourage that state's separation from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P3'>Thompson resigned his position as Interior Secretary in January 1861 and accepted the role of Inspector General of the Confederate army. He later received an army commission and served on the staff of Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard.  Thompson participated in several campaigns in the western theater, including Vicksburg in 1863. In March 1864, he received an assignment by Confederate president Jefferson Davis to lead secret service operations in Canada. Over the next several months, he reportedly developed missions to free Confederate prisoners from Union prison camps, generate anti-war agitation among northern Democrats, foment an insurgency in parts of the northern states, and starting fires in New York City. These plans failed, but reports of his activities generated excitement and fear in northern communities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P4'>When the war ended in 1865, Thompson fled to England and then Canada. He later returned to the United States, when tensions had cooled and most Confederate veterans had received pardons. His Mississippi property had largely been destroyed during the Civil War, so Thompson created a new home for himself in Memphis, Tennessee. He became a board member of the University of the South. Thompson died on March 24, 1885. He was married to Catharine Jones and had at least one child. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.
