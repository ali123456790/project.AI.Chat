                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32020021P0'>Established in 1859 in Holly Springs, Mississippi, the Jones-McElwain and Company Iron Foundry initially manufactured a variety of commercial and industrial iron products, such as railroad forgings, iron fences and railings, and iron decorations for homes and businesses. In 1861, shortly after the start of the Civil War, the foundry contracted with the Confederate government to produce 20,000 Mississippi Rifles (a rifle musket design made famous by Mississippi troops during the Mexican War) and 10,000 U.S. Model 1842 smoothbore muskets for the Confederate Army. The company also contracted with the State of Mississippi to produce 5,000 firearms. The company received a $40,000 advance from the Confederate government to purchase machinery for firearm production. As it began developing its facilities to construct new weapons, it received thousands of civilian and obsolete military firearms to repair or modify for military use. After the Confederate defeat at Shiloh, Tennessee, in April 1862, company owners feared Holly Springs would be invaded by Union forces and sold the machinery to the Confederate government for $150,000, transferred the weapons it had in stock to Grenada, Mississippi, and moved to Georgia. The company does not appear to have produced any new firearms before selling its machinery; the only weapons known to have been released by Jones-McElwain and Company for service were older model firearms the firm had repaired or modified for service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32020021P1'>In November 1862, Union troops did occupy Holly Springs and a federal medical officer used the old Jones-McElwain and Company facility as a hospital and storage area for medical supplies. The next month, December 1862, Confederate general Earl Van Dorn led a cavalry raid against the Union forces in Holly Springs. The Confederate horsemen captured 1,500 Union troops in town. Before leaving, Van Dorn’s men set fire to the piles of military supplies, including the medical stores in the Jones-McElwain and Company building, which permanently destroyed the foundry.
