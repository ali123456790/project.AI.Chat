                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS85109P0'>William Joseph Hardee was a career military officer who helped shape U.S. Army infantry tactics during the nineteenth century and then served as a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P1'>Born on October 12, 1815, in Camden County, Georgia, Hardee graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1838. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Second U.S. Dragoons and saw service in Florida during the Seminole Wars. In 1840, Hardee received orders to travel to France to study military tactics, due to that country’s strong reputation for military professionalism dating back to the Napoleonic Era of the early nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P2'>Hardee was with the Second U.S. Dragoons in Texas in 1846 during the build-up of hostilities between the United States and Mexico. He was second-in-command of an 80-man detachment sent to scout Mexican military activity near Carricitos Ranch on April 25, 1846. The American scouting party ran into over 1,500 Mexican soldiers and were quickly overwhelmed in a brief skirmish. Hardee and most of the Americans were captured. They were released by the Mexican Army a few days later, but the incident was among the early incidents that sparked the Mexican-American War. Over the next two years, Hardee participated in several engagements, was wounded in a skirmish near La Rosia, Mexico, and received two brevet (honorary) promotions for his performance in battle.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P3'>After the Mexican-American War, Hardee briefly commanded units of the Texas Rangers before transferring to West Point in 1853 to teach tactics. In 1856, served as the school’s commandant of cadets. During this period, by request of Secretary of War (and future Confederate president) Jefferson Davis, Hardee authored the <hi rend='italic'>Rifle and Light Infantry Tactics for the Exercise and Manoeuvres of Troops When Acting as Light Infantry or Riflemen</hi> (or more commonly known as “Hardee’s Tactics”). The book was largely inspired by his time studying French tactics and became the most popular drill manual for infantry soldiers during the Civil War. Hardee also helped design or inspire a distinctive black felt hat adopted by members of the 1st and 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiments in the late 1850s. Known as the “Hardee hat,” the flat-topped and wide brimmed hat was never standard issue for soldiers, but was commonly seen during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P4'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Hardee resigned his U.S. Army commission and volunteered for Confederate service. He was initially made a colonel and placed in command of two forts near Mobile Bay in Alabama. However, he received a promotion to brigadier general in June 1861 and then a promotion to major general in October 1861. He became a corps commander under General Albert Sidney Johnston’s Army of Central Kentucky and participated in the Battle of Shiloh, where he was wounded in the arm. Following that battle, Hardee’s corps was transferred to General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Tennessee. He returned to the field and continued to be a competent and generally popular field officer, performing well at the Battle of Perryville in October 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P5'>In the fall of 1862, Hardee was promoted to lieutenant general. He played a conspicuous part in the Battle of Stones River (or Murfreesboro) in late December 1862 and early January 1863. He later clashed with Bragg (as did many other Confederate officers) and was transferred to the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, but returned to serve under Bragg at Chattanooga in late 1863. Hardee’s corps experienced a stinging defeat in the Battle of Missionary Ridge, when Union soldiers assaulted uphill and overran Confederate defenses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P6'>Fully opposed to Bragg’s command abilities, Hardee worked with other Confederate officers to convince President Jefferson Davis to relieve the unpopular army commander. When Bragg was finally removed from command, Hardee temporarily led the Army of Tennessee before General Joseph E. Johnston arrived to take charge. Hardee spent most of 1864 and 1865 handling different assignments across the south, such as opposing General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union campaign at Meridian, Mississippi, supporting the Confederate defense of Atlanta, and commanding the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. He continued to fight into North Carolina during the final weeks of the war and surrendered to Union troops after the Battle of Bentonville.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS85109P7'>After the war, Hardee turned to civilian life. He moved to Alabama and eventually became president of the Selma and Meridian Railroad. He died on November 6, 1873, in Wytheville, Virginia. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Dummett, who died in 1853. He married Mary Lewis in 1864. Hardee had at least three children. He is buried in Live Oak Cemetery in Selma, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS76212P0'>LeRoy Pope Walker was the first Secretary of War for the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P1'>Born on February 7, 1817, near Huntsville, Alabama, Walker received a private education before attending the University of Alabama and then the University of Virginia in the 1830s. He studied law and became an attorney before turning 21 years old. Coming from an influential family in Alabama, Walker held various public offices in the state in the 1840s, including serving as a circuit court judge.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P2'>Walker was an outspoken advocate of secession during the 1850s. Following Alabama’s secession in early 1861, Confederate president Jefferson Davis appointed Walker as Secretary of War. He also served as a secession commissioner from Alabama to Tennessee, in an effort to draw the latter state into the Confederacy. Among his most notable actions as a Confederate cabinet member were public speeches in which he made bold—and very wrong—predictions about the fate of the Confederacy. Early in his tenure he rejected the prospect of large war between the Union and the Confederacy, famously claiming he would wipe up all the blood spilled with his handkerchief. After the firing on Fort Sumter and the sudden rush to war, Walker made another speech prophesizing a Confederate flag waving over the White House in Washington, D.C. By the late summer of 1861 he suffered health problems from work-related stress. President Davis offered him the opportunity to travel to Europe as a representative of the Confederate government, but Walker declined. He stepped down as secretary in September 1861, but accepted a commission as brigadier general in the Confederacy army and (despite no military experience) commanded troops at military forts and posts in Alabama. He resigned his commission in March 1862, but returned to the military in April 1864 to serve as a military judge.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76212P3'>Following the Civil War, Walker was active in opposing Republican Reconstruction in Alabama, including serving as president of the Alabama constitutional convention in 1875 that overturned Reconstruction policies. Following Reconstruction, he worked as an attorney in Alabama. He died on August 23, 1884. Walker was married twice, first to a Miss Hopkins who passed away after bearing him two children. He then married Eliza Dickson Pickett and had three more children. Walker is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94830P0'>Artillery, also known as cannons, are weapons that fire projectiles for longer ranges than small arms carried by infantry soldiers. The term artillery is also used to describe units, or the branch of service within the army, that operate cannons. During the Civil War, the most common artillery pieces were mounted on wheels and were capable of being transported by horses for deployment in battle. Called “field artillery,” these relatively small cannons were intended to inflict damage on enemy troops and light defensive positions. When mobility was not necessary, such as with fixed fortifications, artillery units used much heavier cannons with greater range and destructive power. Coastal defenses especially relied upon large artillery pieces to guard against heavily armed naval vessels.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P1'>Because the Confederacy did not have the same quantity and quality of manufacturing capabilities as northern states, the Confederate army heavily relied upon captured Union cannons and ammunition to outfit its artillery units. A shortage of guns meant that Confederate artillery batteries (the smallest individual artillery unit) typically consisted of four cannons, often of mixed calibers. This differed from Union batteries which fielded six guns of the same caliber. Shortages also limited Confederate artillery training, leading many people—even in the South—to believe that Confederate artillery capabilities were inferior to those of the Union army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P2'>Initially, Confederate artillery batteries were individually attached to infantry brigades. However, during the latter half of the war, military officials created artillery battalions of three or four batteries each to better combine artillery firepower for infantry divisions. Nevertheless, Confederate artillery officers, such as the chief of artillery for the Army of Northern Virginia Brigadier General William N. Pendleton, found it exceedingly difficult to draw together battalions for mass artillery fire during fast moving and broad battle fronts. (Wikipedia)

Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while this Company will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mis-takes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding two hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages, from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.
