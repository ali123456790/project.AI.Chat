                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63204P0'>Isham Green Harris was governor of Tennessee during the secession crisis and the Civil War, and later served as a U.S. senator from Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63204P1'>Born on February 10, 1818, in Franklin County, Tennessee, Harris moved to Ripley, Mississippi, in 1838 to start a business and study law. In 1841, he sold his business and returned to Tennessee to begin practicing law. Within a few years he became one of the most successful criminal attorneys in the state. In 1847 he entered politics, winning a seat in the Tennessee Senate and then, in 1849, successfully running for a U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat. In Congress, Harris was a strong advocate of slavery and argued against the Compromise of 1850, which tried to settle the dispute between pro-slavery and anti-slavery representatives in Congress over the status of slavery in territories acquired from the Mexican-American War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63204P2'>Harris was elected governor of Tennessee in 1857. He gained a reputation as a fierce defender of pro-southern and pro-slavery interests, and warned against northern antislavery sentiments. In January 1861, during the secession crisis that followed Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Harris called for a statewide vote to determine the Tennessee’s fate in the Union. The state had a strong Unionist population, and a majority of voters rejected secession. However, following the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Lincoln’s subsequent call for volunteers to put down the southern rebellion in April 1861, Harris denounced the federal government. He began raising troops for the Confederacy, and helped lead Tennessee to a formal declaration of secession in June 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63204P3'>In 1862, Union forces captured Nashville and held much of Tennessee. Harris relocated to Memphis, but was forced to flee to Mississippi when federal soldiers secured that city as well. A refugee from his own state, Harris spent the next three years following Confederate armies, often serving as an aide-de-camp to various generals. He was with Albert Sidney Johnston at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, and helped carry that general off of the field when he was mortally wounded. Later he was an aid to Joseph E. Johnston, Braxton Bragg, John Bell Hood, and P.G.T. Beauregard.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63204P4'>At the end of the Civil War, Harris fled the Confederacy since Unionist authorities in Tennessee had issued a warrant for his arrest. In 1867, he learned that officials in the United States would no longer arrest him, so he returned to Tennessee and resumed practicing law in Memphis. When Reconstruction ended in 1877, and Democrats regained control of the Tennessee government, Harris was elected to the U.S. Senate and won multiple reelections, ultimately spending twenty years there, championing low tariffs, bank reforms, currency expansion, and agrarian interests. He died on July 8, 1897, having rebuilt his reputation among many in the federal government and received a funeral in the U.S. Capitol. He was married to Martha Mariah Travis and had seven sons. Harris is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS94773P0'>Leonidas Polk was a bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P1'>Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on April 10, 1806, Polk was raised and educated in North Carolina. He spent two years at the University of North Carolina before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While at West Point, Polk joined the Episcopal Church. He graduated from the military academy in July 1827 and received a commission as a U.S. Army artillery officer. Polk resigned from the army in December 1827 and entered the Virginia Theological Seminary. In 1830, shortly before he completed his religious training, he married Frances Ann Devereux. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P2'>In 1831, Pok was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal Church in 1831. The following year Polk and his wife moved to Maury County, Tennessee. He served as a priest in Columbia. During the 1830s, Polk’s personal finances grew, and he became a prominent slaveowner. By 1840, he owned 111 slaves, and by 1850 he reportedly had 400 enslaved people. In 1841, Polk was elected Bishop of Louisiana. His public standing and great wealth made him a prominent public figure outside of the church. He helped establish the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, intended to be a world-class center of higher learning for the southern, slaveholding states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P3'>In 1861, when the southern states seceded from the Union, Polk oversaw the creation of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. He wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis—a West Point classmate—to offer his services and received a commission as major general in the Confederate Army. Placed in charge of Confederate troops between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers, Polk tried to draw the neutral state of Kentucky into the Confederacy. He sent Confederate units into that state. The maneuver was a major strategic blunder, as the Kentucky legislature reacted with hostility and requested support from the Union to repel the Confederate “invaders.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P4'>Polk clashed with other Confederate generals, including his superior officer, General Albert Sidney Johnston, and submitted his letter of resignation to Jefferson Davis in November 1861. Davis rejected the resignation and Polk retained a field command. He led troops in battle against Ulysses S. Grant at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861, scoring a moral victory by repulsing Grant’s attack. However, a few days later, Polk was seriously wounded when a cannon nicknamed “Lady Polk,” in honor of his wife, exploded during a firing demonstration. He spent several weeks convalescing.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P5'>Polk returned to command in early 1862, leading Confederate soldiers at the battles of Shiloh, Perryville, and Murfreesboro. His performance during these engagements proved his bravery (helping him attain the rank of lieutenant general in October 1862), but also revealed weaknesses in handling logistics and strategy. Most significantly, he continued to engage in rivalries with other officers. He lobbied his friend Jefferson Davis to relieve General Braxton Bragg from command in the west; Bragg in return told Davis that Polk was unwilling to follow orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P6'>In the face of the high profile dispute between Bragg and Polk, in late 1863 Davis placed Polk in command of Confederate soldiers in Mississippi. The state was already partially under Union control—Vicksburg having been captured by Grant in July 1863, and the capital city of Jackson having been sacked by William Tecumseh Sherman—and Polk struggled to resist Union periodic federal raids against key Mississippi towns. Then, in May 1864, Polk received orders to join General Joseph E. Johnston in northern Georgia to repel Sherman’s advance to Atlanta. Polk was placed in command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P7'>On June 14, 1864, near Marietta, Georgia, Polk and several other high ranking Confederate officers found a good vantage point on Pine Mountain to observe Union forces. General Sherman noticed the group of Confederates through field glass. He ordered nearby Union artillery to fire on them. A battery from the First Ohio Light Artillery fired at the Confederate officers. One shell landed close by, startling the Confederates, who then began to disperse. A second shell struck Polk directly, passing through his chest from side-to-side, nearly cutting him in half.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P8'>Despite the controversies surrounding Polk as a Confederate general, he was very popular among Confederate troops. His death was widely mourned within the Confederacy. He was initially buried in Saint Paul’s Church in Augusta, Georgia. However, his remains were moved to Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1945.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25006159P0'>Simon Bolivar Buckner was a Confederate general who later served as governor of Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P1'>Born on April 1, 1823, near Munfordville, Kentucky, Buckner graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1844. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Second U.S. Infantry Regiment, but served only a year before being appointed a professor of geography, history, and ethics at West Point. In 1846, Buckner resigned his teaching position to participate in the Mexican-American War. He served in the Sixth U.S. Infantry Regiment and saw combat at Amazoque, San Antonio, and Churubusco. He was wounded in the latter fight and later received a brevet (honorary) promotion to first lieutenant. Buckner saw additional fighting at Molino del Ray, Chapultepec, and at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P2'>Following the Mexican-American War, Buckner returned to West Point to teach infantry tactics. He resigned a year later—reportedly over a disagreement over mandatory chapel attendance—and served in a variety of assignments over the next few years, including in Kansas Territory, Minnesota, and New York. He left the army in 1855 and lived in Illinois for a short time before moving back to Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Buckner received an appointment as adjutant general of Kentucky’s militia. His home state officially declared itself neutral between the Union and Confederacy, but ultimately took a more pro-Union stance. Buckner held greater sympathies for the Confederacy and, although twice offered the rank of brigadier general in the Union army, volunteered for Confederate service. He received a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate army. Furious pro-Union Kentuckians indicted him for treason and confiscated his property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P4'>Buckner’s first notable combat occurred at Fort Donelson, where Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant—one of Buckner’s friends from the pre-war army—surrounded Confederates. Although third in command, Buckner was placed in charge of the doomed garrison when his two superiors chose to flee overnight. Unable to further resist, Buckner surrendered his command, giving Grant his first major victory of the Civil War.  Buckner was a prisoner of war for five months before he was exchanged for a captured Union general. Upon returning to Confederate lines, he received a promotion to major general and was placed in command of troops within General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Mississippi in the fall of 1862. He participated in a campaign into Kentucky in October 1862, which resulted in a Confederate strategic defeat at the Battle of Perryville. Buckner had performed well, but he and many other Confederate officers condemned Bragg’s abilities as an army commander.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P5'>In 1863, Buckner received command of the Army of East Tennessee but again clashed with Bragg, following the Confederate success at the Battle of Chickamauga, and then the Confederate siege of Union forces at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Buckner was among a group of officers that advocated Bragg be relieved of command, an effort that only resulted in Buckner’s demotion to division command. He traveled home shortly afterwards for medical reasons. After recovering in 1864, he was eventually sent to command the District of West Louisiana and promoted to lieutenant general. One of his assignments was to oversee the sale of cotton through Union lines—a controversial, but important means of gather funds for the Confederate war effort. The war ended while Buckner was in Louisiana, and he was the last Confederate general to surrender an army during the Civil War when he formally laid down his arms in New Orleans on June 2, 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P6'>After the war, Buckner remained in Louisiana for three years, according to the terms of his parole which prohibited him from returning to Kentucky until 1868. He spent those three years engaged in newspaper work and insurance business. When he was able to move back to Kentucky, he became the editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Courier</hi> in Louisville. Around this same time, he began pursuing an interest in politics. Buckner took part in several Democratic Party conventions in the 1870s and early 1880s, and in 1887 won election as Kentucky’s governor. He served until 1891, spending much of his time trying to reduce violence in the eastern part of the state and improving Kentucky’s tax system. After leaving the governor’s office, Buckner was considered a candidate for the U.S. Senate and for vice president. However, he did not generate enough support for electoral victories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P7'>Buckner died on January 8, 1914. He was married twice, first to Mary Kingsbury with whom he had one daughter. Mary passed away from tuberculosis in 1874. He married Delia Claiborne in 1885 and had one son, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., born in 1886, who became a U.S. Army lieutenant general and was the highest ranking American officer killed by enemy fire during World War II. The elder Buckner is buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.
