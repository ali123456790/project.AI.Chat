                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94766P0'>Albert Sidney Johnston served as a general in three different national armies, the last being with the Confederacy. Born on February 2, 1803, in Washington, Kentucky, Johnston moved to Texas at a young age. He attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduating there in 1826. His early military assignments involved campaigns against Native Americans in Wisconsin and Illinois.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P1'>Johnston married Henrietta Preston in 1829 and had two children. In 1834, he resigned from the army to care for his wife, who began suffering from tuberculosis and eventually died in 1836. Shortly afterward, Johnston moved to Texas, at that time an independent republic. He volunteered for military service, receiving the rank of colonel and an appointment as Adjutant General in 1836. The following year he was promoted to brigadier general in command of the Texas army. In 1838, Johnston received an appointment as Secretary of War for the Texas Republic. He actively participated in field campaigns during the Cherokee War in 1838 and 1839. In 1840, he resigned and moved back to Kentucky. He remarried in 1843, to Eliza Griffin, and returned to Texas to a plantation called “China Grove” in Brazoria County. He and Eliza had four more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P2'>Johnston volunteered for U.S. military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846. He initially commanded a regiment of Texas volunteers, but later received an appointment as inspector general of a division commanded by Brigadier General William O. Butler. When Butler was wounded and carried off the field at the Battle of Monterrey, Johnston took command of the brigade. His performance there was widely praised, including by General Zachary Taylor who reportedly called Johnston the finest soldier he had commanded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P3'>Johnston resigned from the U.S. Army shortly after the Battle of Monterrey, in accordance with a promise to his wife to only serve six months in Mexico. Additionally, he believed his political affiliation with the Whig Party likely hindered promotion from President James K. Polk’s Democratic administration. He returned to his plantation in Texas. Following the Mexican-American War, Johnston received an offer to serve as a U.S. Army paymaster for soldiers in Texas—now part of the United States—and in 1855 he was promoted to colonel in command of the Second United States Cavalry Regiment. His subordinates in that unit included future Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, William J. Hardee, Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and John Bell Hood, as well as future Union generals George H. Thomas and George Stoneman. As a cavalry commander, Johnston saw extensive field operations in the west, fighting Comanches in Texas and then in Utah during the U.S. government’s conflict with Mormon settlers there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P4'>With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, initially opposed secession but then offered his services to the Confederacy. A slaveowner himself, Johnston was entirely opposed to northern anti-slavery policies and abolitionism. He resigned from his position as commander of the U.S. Army’s Department of the Pacific in California and joined a pro-Confederate militia unit in Los Angeles. In the summer of 1861, he traveled east to the Confederacy and received command of all Confederate forces in the Western Department. Confederate President Jefferson Davis who greatly admired Johnston, having known him since they were students together at Transylvania University and West Point, promoted him to full general on August 31, 1861. Johnston’s command consisted of fewer than 40,000 soldiers tasked with defending the Confederacy from Union incursions around Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, and Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P5'>Despite some early Confederate successes in the west in 1861, such as the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, Union troops made important gains in early 1862, capturing Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. Johnston was forced to withdraw and consolidate his troops at Corinth, Mississippi. Then, in early April 1862, Johnston learned that Union soldiers under Ulysses S. Grant were encamped at Pittsburg Landing along the Tennessee River in southwest Tennessee awaiting reinforcements. Johnston ordered his Army of Mississippi northward in a bold plan to surprise and destroy Grant’s army. On April 6, 1862, Johnston’s Confederates launched an early morning assault through thick woods near a small church named Shiloh, outside the Union encampment at Pittsburg Landing. The federal troops were caught off guard and pressed back, though several Union regiments stubbornly held their ground that morning, leading to intense musketry and artillery fire. Johnston rode forward to lead part of an attack on a Union defensive position nicknamed the “Hornet’s Nest.” As he sat on his horse encouraging his soldiers, a bullet struck him in the leg, behind the knee. The wound severed the artery, causing rapid blood loss. Only when he slumped in his saddle did Johnston’s staff officers realize that something was wrong. One officer asked Johnston if he had been wounded. The general, pale from the loss of blood, responded, “Yes, and I fear seriously.” By the time his staff officers carried him from his horse to a ravine for cover, Johnston was unconscious. He died of blood loss before a physician arrived. Johnston’s subordinate, General P. G. T. Beauregard, took command of the Army of Mississippi shortly afterwards. Although initially successful during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh, the Confederate army was beaten the following day by a Union counterattack, and forced to retreat back to Corinth.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P6'>Johnston’s death was considered a major loss to the Confederacy, as he was described by many—especially Jefferson Davis—as the south’s greatest general at that time. Johnston’s widow and most of his children remained in California, although one son also joined the Confederacy but was killed in a steamboat accident in 1863. Johnston’s remains were initially buried in New Orleans but moved shortly after the war to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25006159P0'>Simon Bolivar Buckner was a Confederate general who later served as governor of Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P1'>Born on April 1, 1823, near Munfordville, Kentucky, Buckner graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1844. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Second U.S. Infantry Regiment, but served only a year before being appointed a professor of geography, history, and ethics at West Point. In 1846, Buckner resigned his teaching position to participate in the Mexican-American War. He served in the Sixth U.S. Infantry Regiment and saw combat at Amazoque, San Antonio, and Churubusco. He was wounded in the latter fight and later received a brevet (honorary) promotion to first lieutenant. Buckner saw additional fighting at Molino del Ray, Chapultepec, and at Mexico City.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P2'>Following the Mexican-American War, Buckner returned to West Point to teach infantry tactics. He resigned a year later—reportedly over a disagreement over mandatory chapel attendance—and served in a variety of assignments over the next few years, including in Kansas Territory, Minnesota, and New York. He left the army in 1855 and lived in Illinois for a short time before moving back to Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Buckner received an appointment as adjutant general of Kentucky’s militia. His home state officially declared itself neutral between the Union and Confederacy, but ultimately took a more pro-Union stance. Buckner held greater sympathies for the Confederacy and, although twice offered the rank of brigadier general in the Union army, volunteered for Confederate service. He received a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate army. Furious pro-Union Kentuckians indicted him for treason and confiscated his property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P4'>Buckner’s first notable combat occurred at Fort Donelson, where Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant—one of Buckner’s friends from the pre-war army—surrounded Confederates. Although third in command, Buckner was placed in charge of the doomed garrison when his two superiors chose to flee overnight. Unable to further resist, Buckner surrendered his command, giving Grant his first major victory of the Civil War.  Buckner was a prisoner of war for five months before he was exchanged for a captured Union general. Upon returning to Confederate lines, he received a promotion to major general and was placed in command of troops within General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Mississippi in the fall of 1862. He participated in a campaign into Kentucky in October 1862, which resulted in a Confederate strategic defeat at the Battle of Perryville. Buckner had performed well, but he and many other Confederate officers condemned Bragg’s abilities as an army commander.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P5'>In 1863, Buckner received command of the Army of East Tennessee but again clashed with Bragg, following the Confederate success at the Battle of Chickamauga, and then the Confederate siege of Union forces at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Buckner was among a group of officers that advocated Bragg be relieved of command, an effort that only resulted in Buckner’s demotion to division command. He traveled home shortly afterwards for medical reasons. After recovering in 1864, he was eventually sent to command the District of West Louisiana and promoted to lieutenant general. One of his assignments was to oversee the sale of cotton through Union lines—a controversial, but important means of gather funds for the Confederate war effort. The war ended while Buckner was in Louisiana, and he was the last Confederate general to surrender an army during the Civil War when he formally laid down his arms in New Orleans on June 2, 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P6'>After the war, Buckner remained in Louisiana for three years, according to the terms of his parole which prohibited him from returning to Kentucky until 1868. He spent those three years engaged in newspaper work and insurance business. When he was able to move back to Kentucky, he became the editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Courier</hi> in Louisville. Around this same time, he began pursuing an interest in politics. Buckner took part in several Democratic Party conventions in the 1870s and early 1880s, and in 1887 won election as Kentucky’s governor. He served until 1891, spending much of his time trying to reduce violence in the eastern part of the state and improving Kentucky’s tax system. After leaving the governor’s office, Buckner was considered a candidate for the U.S. Senate and for vice president. However, he did not generate enough support for electoral victories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006159P7'>Buckner died on January 8, 1914. He was married twice, first to Mary Kingsbury with whom he had one daughter. Mary passed away from tuberculosis in 1874. He married Delia Claiborne in 1885 and had one son, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., born in 1886, who became a U.S. Army lieutenant general and was the highest ranking American officer killed by enemy fire during World War II. The elder Buckner is buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
