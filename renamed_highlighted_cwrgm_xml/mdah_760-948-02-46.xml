                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS93271P0'>Charles Gustavus Dahlgren was a general in the Mississippi Militia during the Civil War. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 13, 1811, Dahlgren was the son of the Swedish Consul in Philadelphia. After briefly serving in the U.S. Navy, Dahlgren moved south, first to Louisiana and then Mississippi. He settled in Natchez, undertaking various businesses and working at the Bank of the United States in Natchez.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS93271P1'>Dahlgren married Mary Malvina Routh in 1840. She died in 1858, and Dahlgren married Mary Edgar Vannoy in 1859. Dahlgren had at least nine children among his two wives.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS93271P2'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, Dahlgren used his own money to raise two military units: the 3rd and the 7th Mississippi Infantry Regiments. He commanded a brigade with the two regiments within the Mississippi Militia. When southern officials transferred the brigade to the Confederate Army, Dahlgren vehemently protested. His complaints not only caused him to be relieved of command but led to a personal feud with Confederate President Jefferson Davis that lasted several years.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS93271P3'>While Dahlgren supported the Confederacy, other members of his family became notable Union service members. His older brother, John A. Dahlgren, had made a career out of the naval service, designing a cast-iron cannon (named the “Dahlgren” after him) that became a standard artillery piece for the U.S. Navy, and holding the rank of rear admiral in the Union navy during the Civil War. John’s son Ulric Dahlgren was a Union cavalry officer who led a bold raid into the Confederate to capture or kill Confederate leaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS93271P4'>Charles Dahlgren suffered significant financial loss due to the Civil War. He practiced law and moved periodically over the next twenty years, first to New Orleans, then Virginia, and then New York. He died in Brooklyn, New York, on December 18, 1888. His family buried his remains the City Cemetery in Natchez, Mississippi.

<p corresp='TTP25189525P1' xml:id='OTP25189525P1'>THE PUBLIC are notified, that in order to guard against mistakes in the transmission of messages, every message of importance ought to be repeated by being sent back from the station at which it is to be received, to the station from which it is originally sent. Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while this company will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding two hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated mes-sages, from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.

<p corresp='TTP25189525P2' xml:id='OTP25189525P2'>All messages will hereafter be received by this Company for transmission, subject to the above conditions.
