                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94766P0'>Albert Sidney Johnston served as a general in three different national armies, the last being with the Confederacy. Born on February 2, 1803, in Washington, Kentucky, Johnston moved to Texas at a young age. He attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduating there in 1826. His early military assignments involved campaigns against Native Americans in Wisconsin and Illinois.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P1'>Johnston married Henrietta Preston in 1829 and had two children. In 1834, he resigned from the army to care for his wife, who began suffering from tuberculosis and eventually died in 1836. Shortly afterward, Johnston moved to Texas, at that time an independent republic. He volunteered for military service, receiving the rank of colonel and an appointment as Adjutant General in 1836. The following year he was promoted to brigadier general in command of the Texas army. In 1838, Johnston received an appointment as Secretary of War for the Texas Republic. He actively participated in field campaigns during the Cherokee War in 1838 and 1839. In 1840, he resigned and moved back to Kentucky. He remarried in 1843, to Eliza Griffin, and returned to Texas to a plantation called “China Grove” in Brazoria County. He and Eliza had four more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P2'>Johnston volunteered for U.S. military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846. He initially commanded a regiment of Texas volunteers, but later received an appointment as inspector general of a division commanded by Brigadier General William O. Butler. When Butler was wounded and carried off the field at the Battle of Monterrey, Johnston took command of the brigade. His performance there was widely praised, including by General Zachary Taylor who reportedly called Johnston the finest soldier he had commanded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P3'>Johnston resigned from the U.S. Army shortly after the Battle of Monterrey, in accordance with a promise to his wife to only serve six months in Mexico. Additionally, he believed his political affiliation with the Whig Party likely hindered promotion from President James K. Polk’s Democratic administration. He returned to his plantation in Texas. Following the Mexican-American War, Johnston received an offer to serve as a U.S. Army paymaster for soldiers in Texas—now part of the United States—and in 1855 he was promoted to colonel in command of the Second United States Cavalry Regiment. His subordinates in that unit included future Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, William J. Hardee, Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and John Bell Hood, as well as future Union generals George H. Thomas and George Stoneman. As a cavalry commander, Johnston saw extensive field operations in the west, fighting Comanches in Texas and then in Utah during the U.S. government’s conflict with Mormon settlers there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P4'>With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, initially opposed secession but then offered his services to the Confederacy. A slaveowner himself, Johnston was entirely opposed to northern anti-slavery policies and abolitionism. He resigned from his position as commander of the U.S. Army’s Department of the Pacific in California and joined a pro-Confederate militia unit in Los Angeles. In the summer of 1861, he traveled east to the Confederacy and received command of all Confederate forces in the Western Department. Confederate President Jefferson Davis who greatly admired Johnston, having known him since they were students together at Transylvania University and West Point, promoted him to full general on August 31, 1861. Johnston’s command consisted of fewer than 40,000 soldiers tasked with defending the Confederacy from Union incursions around Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, and Kentucky.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P5'>Despite some early Confederate successes in the west in 1861, such as the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, Union troops made important gains in early 1862, capturing Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. Johnston was forced to withdraw and consolidate his troops at Corinth, Mississippi. Then, in early April 1862, Johnston learned that Union soldiers under Ulysses S. Grant were encamped at Pittsburg Landing along the Tennessee River in southwest Tennessee awaiting reinforcements. Johnston ordered his Army of Mississippi northward in a bold plan to surprise and destroy Grant’s army. On April 6, 1862, Johnston’s Confederates launched an early morning assault through thick woods near a small church named Shiloh, outside the Union encampment at Pittsburg Landing. The federal troops were caught off guard and pressed back, though several Union regiments stubbornly held their ground that morning, leading to intense musketry and artillery fire. Johnston rode forward to lead part of an attack on a Union defensive position nicknamed the “Hornet’s Nest.” As he sat on his horse encouraging his soldiers, a bullet struck him in the leg, behind the knee. The wound severed the artery, causing rapid blood loss. Only when he slumped in his saddle did Johnston’s staff officers realize that something was wrong. One officer asked Johnston if he had been wounded. The general, pale from the loss of blood, responded, “Yes, and I fear seriously.” By the time his staff officers carried him from his horse to a ravine for cover, Johnston was unconscious. He died of blood loss before a physician arrived. Johnston’s subordinate, General P. G. T. Beauregard, took command of the Army of Mississippi shortly afterwards. Although initially successful during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh, the Confederate army was beaten the following day by a Union counterattack, and forced to retreat back to Corinth.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94766P6'>Johnston’s death was considered a major loss to the Confederacy, as he was described by many—especially Jefferson Davis—as the south’s greatest general at that time. Johnston’s widow and most of his children remained in California, although one son also joined the Confederacy but was killed in a steamboat accident in 1863. Johnston’s remains were initially buried in New Orleans but moved shortly after the war to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

THE PUBLIC are notified, that in order to guard against mistakes in the transmission of messages, every message of importance ought to be repeated, by being sent back from the station at which it is to be received, to the station from which it is originally sent. Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while this Company will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mis-takes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding two hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages, from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.
