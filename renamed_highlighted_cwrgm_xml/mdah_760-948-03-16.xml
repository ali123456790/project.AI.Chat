                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS73091P0'>Mansfield Lovell was a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P1'>Born in Washington, D.C., on October 20, 1822, Lovell was related to some notable figures in early United States history. His father was surgeon general of the U.S. Army, and his great grandfather had been a member of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution. Lovell graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1842 and initially pursued a career with the U.S. Army. He fought in the Mexican-American War, receiving a brevet (honorary) promotion and a serious wound at the Battle of Chapultepec. After recovering from his injuries, he carried out a variety of assignments in the army until 1854, when he resigned to join a planned effort by some Americans to conquer Cuba. The plan fell apart, and Lovell moved to New York City where he took a job with the city administration.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Lovell traveled south to join the Confederacy. He was commissioned as an officer, quickly being promoted to major general in October 1861 and placed in command of Confederate forces at New Orleans, Louisiana. Lovell focused his defense of the city on from Union forces attacking overland from the north. When Union naval forces attacked the city from the south, sailing up the Mississippi River, Lovell was forced to abandon the city in early May 1862. The loss of the city to federal forces was one of the first major defeats for the Confederacy, and Lovell was vehemently criticized across the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P3'>He was then placed in command of a division under Major General Earl Van Dorn and participated in the Second Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, in October 1862. His performance was criticized, and he was relieved of command. With his reputation tarnished, mostly from the loss of New Orleans, Lovell requested a court of inquiry in hopes of justifying his previous command decisions. Indeed, the court found that he had not been guilty of any incompetence, but this did not result in any new military assignments during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P4'>After the war ended, Lovell took over a rice plantation near Savannah, Georgia. During his first year of farming, his crop was destroyed by a tidal wave, forcing him to abandon the endeavor. He moved to New York City and worked as a civil engineer and surveyor. Among his projects was clearing the East River for river traffic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P5'>Lovell died on October 20, 1822, in New York. He was married to Emily Maria Plympton and had one child. Lovell is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.
