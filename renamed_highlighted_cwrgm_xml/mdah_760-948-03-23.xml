                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS101380P0'>Edward Fontaine was an attorney, minister, and Confederate officer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P1'>Born on August 5, 1814, in Greenwood, Virginia, Fontaine was the great grandson of notable American Revolutionary War figure Patrick Henry. He initially pursued a military education at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was expelled after two years, in 1832, due to poor math scores. Fontaine then pursued an education in law and became a practicing attorney in 1835. That same year he traveled to Mississippi and worked on a team that surveyed lands recently acquired by the federal government from the Chickasaw tribe.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P2'>In 1838, Fontaine became a Methodist Episcopal minister. He moved to Texas to work as a preacher, off and on, until the early 1840s. While in Texas he participated in the Somervell expedition, which was a brief military campaign into Mexico in 1842 as part of a simmering dispute between that country and the Republic of Texas. The next year, Fontaine left Texas for Mississippi and in 1848 became a minister in the Episcopal church. He then returned to Texas in 1851 and oversaw the construction of St. David’s Church in Austin and became the chaplain of the Texas Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P3'>Fontaine left Texas again, in 1859, and returned to Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Confederate service. He became captain of Company H, Eighteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and later was appointed chief of ordnance of the Mississippi Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P4'>After the war, Fontaine served as a rector at churches in Mississippi and Louisiana. He also became a strong promoter of historical study and natural sciences, gaining membership in several scientific organizations, such as the New York Historical Society, the New Orleans academy of Science, and the Maryland Academy of Science. He presented papers and speeches on the natural history of Texas, based upon his observations traveling the state, and the terrain and geography of the Mississippi River area.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101380P5'>Fontaine died on January 19, 1884. He was married twice. His first wife was Mary Ann Swisher, who passed away in 1855. In 1859 he married Susan Taylor. Fontaine had at least four children. He is buried at the Belvedere-Sub Rosa Plantation in Pocahontas, Mississippi.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70434P1'>The rail line ran from Mobile, Alabama, to Illinois by the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, and remained in service in the South during much of the war. Fleming was credited with continuing operations throughout the conflict to facilitate the transportation of Confederate military supplies within the South. He remained with that rail line after the war, until the early 1870s. Fleming then worked for the Alabama &amp; Chattanooga Railroad. He died on April 28, 1880, from an overdose of laudanum (opium) he used as a treatment for chronic pain. Overall, Fleming was one of the most successful and famous railroad engineers in the South during the nineteenth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
