                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS102543P0'>Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard was a U.S. Army officer, superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P1'>Born on a sugar plantation in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, on May 28, 1818, Beauregard was from a wealthy, slave owning Louisiana Creole family and grew up speaking French. He did not begin to learn English until attending a school in New York City at the age of twelve. Beauregard attended West Point and was an exceptional student, showing great aptitude in artillery and engineering. He graduated second in his class in 1838.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P2'>Beauregard served with distinction as a military engineer during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. He was brevetted (honorarily promoted) to captain for his performance at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco, and brevetted again to major for his actions at Chapultepec, where he was wounded in the shoulder and thigh. Following the Mexican-American War, Beauregard oversaw military engineering projects along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast. However, by 1856 he grew tired of peacetime service and nearly traveled to Nicaragua to take part in a revolution there being carried out by American volunteers. He was talked out of the effort by his Army colleagues, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott (who had personally seen Beauregard’s performances in Mexico). In January 1861, he secured an appointment as superintendent of West Point. However, he held the position for only five days before Louisiana’s secession prompted U.S. Army officials to revoke the orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P3'>Beauregard returned to New Orleans in early 1861 and joined the Confederate cause. Because of his previous service and reputation, he was quickly promoted, becoming the first Confederate general on March 1, 1861. His first assignment was command over defenses in Charleston, South Carolina. Federal soldiers there under Major Robert A. Anderson—one of Beauregard’s West Point instructors—occupied Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor and refused to relinquish the post without a fight. On April 12, 1861, Beauregard ordered Confederate cannons in Charleston to fire on Fort Sumter, and after a thirty-four hour bombardment Anderson surrendered. The attack upon U.S. Army troops sparked the Civil War, as it spurred President Abraham Lincoln to call for 75,000 volunteers to defeat southern secessionists and led to several other southern states to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P4'>After his victory at Fort Sumter, Beauregard received command of Confederate forces defending northern Virginia and successfully defeated a Union army under Brigadier General Irvin McDowell at the First Battle of Bull Run, near Manassas, Virginia, in July 1861. Despite these victories, Beauregard ran into controversy. He had a brash personality, and publicly criticized people like Confederate president Jefferson Davis; additionally, he bickered with some Confederate officials over strategy, his critics complaining his plans were overly complicated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P5'>In early 1862, Beauregard was transferred to the western theater where he became second-in-command of the Army of Mississippi under General Albert Sidney Johnston. The Confederates attacked Ulysses S. Grant’s army at Pittsburgh Landing along the Tennessee River in early April 1862. More famously known as the Battle of Shiloh, Beauregard took command of the Confederate forces after Johnston was mortally wounded. Despite initial success, Beauregard halted his men due to darkness only to withdraw the following day when Grant’s men were reinforced and counterattacked. Receiving criticism for retreating at Shiloh, Beauregard infuriated Confederate officials more when he abandoned the key railroad hub at Corinth, Mississippi, shortly afterwards. Although his withdrawal had been made to avoid being surrounded by a larger Union force, and because his army was suffering greatly from disease and contaminated water at Corinth, the dual retreats hurt Beauregard’s reputation. When he temporarily left his post for medical treatment, Jefferson Davis relieved him of command.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P6'>Beauregard’s next assignment was a return to Charleston to once against take over defenses of the southeastern Confederate coastline. He performed well, frustrating several Union assaults against Charleston Harbor. However, Beauregard believed his position was beneath his abilities. He interjected himself into political matters, proposing negotiations with federal officials and working behind the scenes to increase the number of Confederate troops in the west at the expense of General Robert E. Lee’s army in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P7'>In early 1864, Beauregard received orders to command Confederate defenses of North Carolina and southern Virginia. He performed very well in this role when Union armies under Ulysses S. Grant and Benjamin Butler maneuvered toward Richmond. Beauregard blocked Butler’s force and protected the key railroad center at Petersburg that summer. Meanwhile, William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army captured Atlanta, Georgia, prompting Confederate high command to shift command in the west. Beauregard was asked to command the new Department of the West, which covered a region from Georgia to the Mississippi River. While the position was not a field command, Beauregard took the opportunity as it placed him above several Confederate armies. The assignment proved difficult, as his troops in Tennessee suffered devastating defeats at Franklin and Nashville and scattered southern forces in Georgia and South Carolina failed to stop Sherman’s army from cutting through Georgia and South Carolina. When Beauregard repeatedly messaged Confederate officials in Richmond for help against Sherman, they relieved him of command and replaced him with Joseph E. Johnston. Unsurprisingly, Johnston fared no better and Confederate forces in the Carolinas were forced to surrender in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P8'>After the Civil War, Beauregard returned to New Orleans. He opposed Radical Reconstruction measures in the south, but less due to matters over Black civil rights and more regarding heavy property tax. Beauregard joined the Reform Party, generally made up of New Orleans businessmen who supported Black suffrage, and appealed to African American voters as an alternative to the Republican Party. He also took part in various business ventures, including railroads and cable car companies, civil engineering projects, and he served as the supervisor of the Louisiana State Lottery Company. He enjoyed substantial financial success from these activities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS102543P9'>Beauregard was married twice during his lifetime. He married Marie Antoinette Laure Villere in 1841. The couple had three children, but Marie died during childbirth to the third in 1850. Beauregard then married Caroline Deslonde in 1860. She died only four years later after a long illness. Beauregard died on February 20, 1893. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P.
