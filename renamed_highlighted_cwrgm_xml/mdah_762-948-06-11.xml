                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS70568P0'>Earl Van Dorn was a Confederate general during the Civil War. He was born near Port Gibson, Mississippi, on September 17, 1820. His mother was the niece of Andrew Jackson, a connection that aided Van Dorn during his application to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1838. He graduated in 1842, but had received 163 demerits as a cadet due to actions such as failing to salute, using profanity, and using tobacco. Upon graduation, Van Dorn was appointed to the Seventh U.S. Infantry Regiment and served at various posts in the south, including Fort Pike in Louisiana, Fort Morgan in Alabama, and Pensacola in Florida.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P1'>Van Dorn married Caroline Godbold in 1843 and the couple had two children. However, Van Dorn developed a reputation as a womanizer, in part due to his famous good looks and charm. Additionally, he gained fame for military service during the Mexican-American War and later against Comanches in the west. These factors reportedly contributed to his popularity at social engagements, and especially among some women.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P2'>When the Civil War broke out in early 1861, Van Dorn resigned from the U.S. Army. He received an appointment as major general in the Mississippi militia, but shortly afterwards transferred to the Confederate army as a colonel. His first assignment was to raise a brigade of Texas troops and arrest any federal soldiers in that state. Upon reaching Galveston in mid-April 1861, Van Dorn led a group of secessionists to the harbor and captured three U.S. ships without a fight. The act prompted President Abraham Lincoln to brand Van Dorn a pirate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P3'>Fresh from his victory in Texas, Van Dorn was sent to Richmond, Virginia, for promotion. By September 1861, he received the rank of major general in the Confederate Army and in January 1862 he was sent to command the new Trans-Mississippi District. Upon taking command, Van Dorn faced a Union invasion of Arkansas. He led a campaign to defeat this threat and drive north into Missouri to capture St. Louis. The plan failed when his army lost a battle against Union troops at Pea Ridge, Arkansas, in March 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P4'>Van Dorn withdrew to Mississippi in mid-April 1862, after Confederate troops under Albert Sidney Johnston had suffered a defeat at Shiloh in southwestern Tennessee and evacuated Corinth, Mississippi. Van Dorn led an assault upon Corinth, determined to recapture it from federal troops. Although his attack began well, he had failed to study the Union positions at Corinth, and threw his Confederate troops against formidable fortifications. The assault failed and Van Dorn was relieved of command. He was given a smaller assignment, to lead Confederate cavalry under General John C. Pemberton.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P5'>Although he had not seen much success as an infantry commander, Van Dorn proved much more effective at the head of a cavalry force. He led a brilliant cavalry raid against Ulysses S. Grant’s supply depot at Holly Springs, Mississippi, in December 1862, spoiling the Union army’s first effort to reach Vicksburg, Mississippi. He continued to participate in Confederate cavalry raids and skirmishes against Union troops in Mississippi until his death in May 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P6'>Van Dorn was not killed in battle but at the hands of a jealous husband. In April 1863, Van Dorn had begun an affair with the young wife of a physician and state legislator, Dr. George B. Peters, in Spring Hill, Mississippi. Dr. Peters had caught his wife in the arms of Van Dorn on April 12. He nearly shot the general at that time, but Van Dorn managed to talk his way out of the situation. Then, three weeks later, on May 7, Dr. Peters went into Van Dorn’s headquarters, a stately mansion in Spring Hill, and shot the general in the back of the head while he worked at a desk. Dr. Peters was arrested for murder, but never brought to trial, as most southerners sympathized with his plight as an offended husband.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70568P7'>Van Dorn was initially buried in Alabama, but later moved to Wintergreen Cemetery in Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70883P0'>The Confederate Navy was the military naval force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It was established by the Confederate Congress on February 21, 1861, and was primarily responsible for protecting the Confederacy’s coastlines and harbors from federal attack and disrupting the United States Navy’s blockade of Southern ports. At its creation, the Confederate Navy had thirty ships, only fourteen of which were seaworthy. In contrast, the United States Navy had approximately ninety ships ready for service. Despite manufacturing limitations, the Confederate Navy eventually increased its size to slightly over one hundred ships and approximately 5,000 sailors. Still, it could not compete directly with the Union Navy, which enlarged to more than 650 ships and around 20,000 sailors.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P1'>Because of its smaller size, the Confederate Navy sought new and unconventional methods to challenge Union naval supremacy. This included inviting privateers—privately owned ships that engaged in warfare—to attack Union ships, particularly merchant vessels, for the Confederate cause. More famously, the Confederate Navy built ironclad vessels (wooden ships protected by iron plates) and the first submarine (named the <hi rend='italic'>Hunley</hi>) in an effort to defeat Union ships through technological innovation. These efforts did not change the trajectory of the war, though, due in part to the Confederacy’s inability to build these new ships in great number and by the Union Navy’s own development of ironclad warships.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P2'>Confederate Navy ships also performed blockade running operations and attacked Union vessels traversing the Atlantic to and from Europe. These efforts were intended to open avenues for Confederate merchant vessels to carry on foreign trade and to draw Union ships away from the Confederacy’s coast. However, efforts to overcome the Union blockade proved ineffective. Federal ships managed to reduce the South’s trade to only five percent of its pre-war levels.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P3'>The Confederate Navy was the last vestige of the Confederacy. It ceased to exist on November 6, 1865, with the surrender of the CSS <I>Shenandoah</I> in Liverpool, England. That event also marked the end of the Civil War. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63977P0'>The United States Navy, also known as the Union Navy during the American Civil War, was primarily responsible for blockading the Confederacy’s coastlines and harbors, destroying Confederate ships, and supporting Union Army amphibious operations along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shores, and river. At the beginning of the war, the Union Navy had ninety ships, far outmatching the Confederacy’s fourteen vessels. Through the North’s superior manufacturing capabilities and larger population, the Union Navy substantially increased its force to more than 650 ships and 20,000 sailors by the time the war ended. In comparison, the Confederate Navy barely surpassed one hundred ships and 5,000 sailors.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P1'>The Union Navy’s blockade of the Confederacy was very successful, cutting the South’s trade to only five percent of its pre-war numbers. In a vain effort to defeat the federal ships blocking their harbors, Confederate forces focused on innovative ship technology, such as ironclad vessels (wooden ships protected by iron plates) and the first operational submarine (named the Henley). Union officials managed to counter these efforts by developing their own ironclad ships, including the USS <I>Monitor</I>, a flat, iron-plated vessel with a rotating turret.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P2'>While the Union Navy did engage in a few notable sea battles (the fight between the USS <I>Monitor</I> and the Confederacy’s ironclad CSS <I>Virginia</I> being the most famous), most of its combat action involved supporting the Union Army’s ground operations along the Mississippi River, at Mobile Bay, and in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fort Fisher, North Carolina. Capturing ports and coastal fortifications not only reduced the strength of the Confederate military, but gave the Union Navy vital supply bases for its own operations around the South. The assaults upon the coastal positions involved more traditional naval warfare with cannonading by wooden ships; but the Navy developed the shallower draft ironclads for operations on the rivers and waterways. These steam-powered ships were more maneuverable than wooden sail ships, and were better protected against close-range artillery by Confederate river forts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P3'>After the Civil War, the Union Navy—like the army—downsized to a number close to its pre-war number. However, the war had introduced key technological and doctrinal changes to sea and river warfare across the globe. At least for a short time, the Union Navy had been the most technologically advanced maritime force in the world. (Wikipedia; American Battlefield Trust)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
