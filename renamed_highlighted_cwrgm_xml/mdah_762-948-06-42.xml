                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99666P0'>In warfare, an army moving into an enemy’s home territory is often described as an invasion. During the American Civil War, most examples of military forces moving into enemy territory involved Union armies advancing into Confederate states. Some of these incursions were temporary, such as small cavalry raids to destroy Confederate supplies and even larger campaigns behind Confederate lines to harm Southern infrastructure (such as William T. Sherman’s “March Through Georgia”). However, Union victory in the Civil War depended upon the United States Army conducting offensive operations and occupying large portions of the South. These efforts split apart the Confederacy, placed secessionist communities back under federal control, and reduced the Confederate armies’ ability to wage war. Pro-secessionist Southerners considered these efforts to be federal invasions, and described communities captured by Union armies as being overrun. However, pro-Union Southerners cheered the arrival of Union soldiers, considering them liberators rather than invaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99666P1'>Although the Confederacy fought a defensive war, Southern military forces occasionally conducted incursions into northern communities. Robert E. Lee’s Maryland Campaign in 1862 (which culminated in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862) was seen by many Marylanders as an invasion of their state. His second offensive campaign into the North, in the summer of 1863, was widely reported in the Northern press as a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. That campaign ultimately resulted in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94830P0'>Artillery, also known as cannons, are weapons that fire projectiles for longer ranges than small arms carried by infantry soldiers. The term artillery is also used to describe units, or the branch of service within the army, that operate cannons. During the Civil War, the most common artillery pieces were mounted on wheels and were capable of being transported by horses for deployment in battle. Called “field artillery,” these relatively small cannons were intended to inflict damage on enemy troops and light defensive positions. When mobility was not necessary, such as with fixed fortifications, artillery units used much heavier cannons with greater range and destructive power. Coastal defenses especially relied upon large artillery pieces to guard against heavily armed naval vessels.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P1'>Because the Confederacy did not have the same quantity and quality of manufacturing capabilities as northern states, the Confederate army heavily relied upon captured Union cannons and ammunition to outfit its artillery units. A shortage of guns meant that Confederate artillery batteries (the smallest individual artillery unit) typically consisted of four cannons, often of mixed calibers. This differed from Union batteries which fielded six guns of the same caliber. Shortages also limited Confederate artillery training, leading many people—even in the South—to believe that Confederate artillery capabilities were inferior to those of the Union army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94830P2'>Initially, Confederate artillery batteries were individually attached to infantry brigades. However, during the latter half of the war, military officials created artillery battalions of three or four batteries each to better combine artillery firepower for infantry divisions. Nevertheless, Confederate artillery officers, such as the chief of artillery for the Army of Northern Virginia Brigadier General William N. Pendleton, found it exceedingly difficult to draw together battalions for mass artillery fire during fast moving and broad battle fronts. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63977P0'>The United States Navy, also known as the Union Navy during the American Civil War, was primarily responsible for blockading the Confederacy’s coastlines and harbors, destroying Confederate ships, and supporting Union Army amphibious operations along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shores, and river. At the beginning of the war, the Union Navy had ninety ships, far outmatching the Confederacy’s fourteen vessels. Through the North’s superior manufacturing capabilities and larger population, the Union Navy substantially increased its force to more than 650 ships and 20,000 sailors by the time the war ended. In comparison, the Confederate Navy barely surpassed one hundred ships and 5,000 sailors.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P1'>The Union Navy’s blockade of the Confederacy was very successful, cutting the South’s trade to only five percent of its pre-war numbers. In a vain effort to defeat the federal ships blocking their harbors, Confederate forces focused on innovative ship technology, such as ironclad vessels (wooden ships protected by iron plates) and the first operational submarine (named the Henley). Union officials managed to counter these efforts by developing their own ironclad ships, including the USS <I>Monitor</I>, a flat, iron-plated vessel with a rotating turret.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P2'>While the Union Navy did engage in a few notable sea battles (the fight between the USS <I>Monitor</I> and the Confederacy’s ironclad CSS <I>Virginia</I> being the most famous), most of its combat action involved supporting the Union Army’s ground operations along the Mississippi River, at Mobile Bay, and in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fort Fisher, North Carolina. Capturing ports and coastal fortifications not only reduced the strength of the Confederate military, but gave the Union Navy vital supply bases for its own operations around the South. The assaults upon the coastal positions involved more traditional naval warfare with cannonading by wooden ships; but the Navy developed the shallower draft ironclads for operations on the rivers and waterways. These steam-powered ships were more maneuverable than wooden sail ships, and were better protected against close-range artillery by Confederate river forts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P3'>After the Civil War, the Union Navy—like the army—downsized to a number close to its pre-war number. However, the war had introduced key technological and doctrinal changes to sea and river warfare across the globe. At least for a short time, the Union Navy had been the most technologically advanced maritime force in the world. (Wikipedia; American Battlefield Trust)
