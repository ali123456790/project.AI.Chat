</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52702P1'>Born on April 12, 1827, in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Van Horne began working in telegraph offices shortly after the development of telegraphy, starting as a messenger boy and working his way to manager of various telegraph offices in Ohio, Michigan, and Alabama, by the 1850s.

<p xml:id='OTPS52702P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Van Horne became president of the Southwestern Telegraph Company, which continued operation behind Confederate lines. After the war, he helped consolidate several telegraph companies into Western Union and became the general superintendent of the company’s southern division. He was elected to company vice president in 1878. He served in that role until retiring in the late 1890s. Van Horne passed away in 1902 near Louisville, Kentucky. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52203P0'>James H. Rives was a Confederate soldier and the Mississippi governor’s private secretary during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52203P1'>Born in 1830 in Georgia, Rives moved to Noxubee County, Mississippi, as a young man and became a practicing attorney. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Rives volunteered for military service, and was commissioned as an officer in a militia company named the Noxubee Rifles. He received a commission in the Confederate army when the company was incorporated into the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment as Company F.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52203P2'>By late 1862, Rives had left the regiment and accepted an appointment as private secretary to Mississippi governor John J. Pettus. He served in that role for most of 1863. After the war, Rives returned to Noxubee County and practiced law. He married Leona Cotton in 1868 and had at least one daughter. Rives was active in Noxubee County politics in the late 1860s and early 1870s, and was called before the U.S. Congress to testify to about race relations in Mississippi in 1871. He died in 1875.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025339P0'>Insubordination is the refusal to obey someone of higher authority. During the Civil War, insubordination commonly included disobeying an order, disrespectful language, or striking a superior. These types of actions occurred often early in the war, during the rapid expansion of the Union and Confederate armies, when tens of thousands of civilian volunteers found themselves under strict military discipline. The initial enthusiasm for military service was tempered by the tedium of camp life and drill, and could be exacerbated by inexperienced, and incompetent, officers. Insubordination also occurred among veterans throughout the war, particularly during periods of low morale, when soldiers became homesick or saw the prospects of victory fading. Ultimately, insubordination during the Civil War occurred among individuals and sometimes groups of soldiers who disliked their leadership or otherwise objected to the orders from authorities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025339P1'>Military officers responded to insubordination harshly. Minor offenses were handled by assigning the offender extra labor or through corporal punishment, such as tying the soldier to a tree, sometimes above ground, or “bucking and gagging” (where the soldier’s arms were tied around the knees with a stick between the arms and knees, and a gag placed in the mouth). More serious examples of insubordination were often handled by court martial, resulting in imprisonment with hard labor, loss of pay, and dishonorable discharge. Punishments were usually made public, to serve as a warning to other potential offenders. (Bell Irvin Wiley, <hi rend='italic'>The Life of Billy Yank</hi>, 198-202; NCpedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.
