<p xml:id='OTPS52702P1'>Born on April 12, 1827, in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Van Horne began working in telegraph offices shortly after the development of telegraphy, starting as a messenger boy and working his way to manager of various telegraph offices in Ohio, Michigan, and Alabama, by the 1850s.

<p xml:id='OTPS52702P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Van Horne became president of the Southwestern Telegraph Company, which continued operation behind Confederate lines. After the war, he helped consolidate several telegraph companies into Western Union and became the general superintendent of the company’s southern division. He was elected to company vice president in 1878. He served in that role until retiring in the late 1890s. Van Horne passed away in 1902 near Louisville, Kentucky. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63513P0'>Christopher Gustavus Memminger was an author of the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States of America and the first Secretary of the Treasury for the Confederacy. Born on January 9, 1803, in Vaihingen, Wuerttemberg (modern-day Stuttgart, Germany), Memminger moved to Charleston, South Carolina, as a small child with his mother after his father passed away. He was orphaned in 1807 when his mother died of yellow fever, but at the age of eleven was taken in by Thomas Bennett, future governor of South Carolina. At age twelve, Memminger entered South Carolina College and graduated at the age of sixteen. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in 1825. Memminger became involved in the 1830s, winning an election to the South Carolina state legislature in 1836 and served almost continuously until 1860. He chaired the legislature’s finance committee for most of his time in office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P1'>Memminger was considered a moderate among southerners during the growing sectional crisis. He opposed South Carolina’s proponents of nullification (the theory that a state could reject a federal law it opposed) and was hesitant to support calls for secession during the 1850s. However, after Abraham Lincoln was elected president on an anti-slavery Republican platform in 1860, Memminger became an advocate for disunion and wrote the proclamation outlining South Carolina’s secession from the Union, entitled <hi rend='italic'>Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union</hi>.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P2'>Memminger was elected to represent South Carolina in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He chaired the committee that drafted a constitution for the Confederacy in four days, and then received an appointment as Secretary of the Treasury in February 1861. In that role he struggled to finance the Confederate war effort, resorting to supporting income taxes, widespread issuing of paper money, and even confiscating gold from the U.S. Mint in New Orleans. Memminger served as Treasury secretary until July 1864, then resigned and retired to his summer home in North Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63513P3'>After the Civil War, Memminger returned to Charleston, South Carolina, and operated a law practice. He also returned to the state legislature, dedicating much of his time to improving South Carolina’s public education system. He died on March 7, 1888, in Charleston. Memminger was married to Mary Wilkinson and had seventeen children (only eight survived to adulthood). After Mary passed away in 1874, Memminger married her sister Sarah Ann. Memminger is buried in Saint John in the Wilderness Cemetery in Flat Rock, North Carolina.

Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while this Company will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding two hundred times the amount paid for sending the message ; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.
