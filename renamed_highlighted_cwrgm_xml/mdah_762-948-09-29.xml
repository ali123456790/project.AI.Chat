                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32013822P0'>Benjamin Henry Grierson was a Union cavalry officer during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P1'>Born on July 8, 1826, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, Grierson first pursued a career in music. By 1851 he was a music teacher and band leader in Illinois. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Union military service. He initially served on the staff of Major General Benjamin M. Prentiss, and in late 1861 was promoted to major and assigned to the Sixth Illinois Cavalry. He rose in the ranks to colonel and placed in command of the regiment in April 1862. Grierson proved to be a very capable cavalry officer, leading his troops through several engagements in Tennessee and Mississippi that year. He received command of the Army of the Tennessee’s cavalry division in November 1862, responsible for protecting Ulysses S. Grant’s supply line during the Union campaign into Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P2'>Grierson became famous for leading bold cavalry raids deep into Confederate territory. In the spring of 1863, he led 1,700 Union cavalry troops in a 17-day, 800-mile long raid from La Grange, Tennessee, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, destroying Confederate supplies, rail lines, and capturing several Confederate soldiers. The physical damage from the raid was less significant than the psychological effect it had on Confederate citizens, by demonstrating the Union forces had the capabilities and determination to attack almost anywhere within the Confederacy. Union general William Tecumseh Sherman praised Grierson’s raid, which may have inspired his own “march to the sea” campaign across Georgia a year and a half later. Grierson’s raid through Mississippi in 1863 was also significant in drawing Confederate soldiers away from Grant’s drive toward Vicksburg.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P3'>In the wake of this success, Grierson received a promotion to brigadier general. He supported Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’s operations around Port Hudson and then participated in the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads and the Battle of Tupelo. Shortly before Christmas 1864 Grierson led another bold campaign behind enemy lines, which lasted until January 5, 1865, and resulted in his men overrunning a Confederate encampment at Verona, Mississippi, and capturing more than 500 Confederate soldiers after attacking a train near Egypt Station, Mississippi. Union commanders were so pleased with Grierson’s successes that they promoted him to major general of volunteers shortly afterwards.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P4'>Grierson chose to stay in the U.S. Regular Army after the Civil War ended and the Union army severely downsized. Unlike many other professional officers, he had not attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, or any other military academy. His citizen-soldier background, added to his assignment as colonel over an African American unit—the Tenth U.S. Cavalry Regiment—made him a sort of outcast within the highly competitive army officer ranks. Over the next two decades he served at various posts in Kansas, Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma), Texas, Missouri, New Mexico, and Arizona.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P5'>Grierson retired from the army in 1890 at the age of 64. He died on August 31, 18911, in Michigan. He was married twice, first to Alice Kirk, who passed away in 1888. In 1897 he married Lillian Atwood. Grierson had at least seven children. He is buried in Jacksonville East Cemetery in Jacksonville, Illinois.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25015720P0'>Uncas Bourne was an attorney and a Confederate officer from Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015720P1'>Born around 1834 in Tennessee, he moved to Mississippi as a young man and practiced law in Rankin County. During the secession crisis of 1860-1861, Bourne took part in Unionist meetings in opposition to disunion rhetoric. However, when the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Confederate service, and was appointed chief ordnance officer in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015720P2'>After the Civil War, Bourne returned to his law practice. He became active in Democratic politics and highly critical of federal Reconstruction. He unsuccessfully ran for district attorney of Mississippi’s Fourth Judicial District in the fall of 1865, but continued to make speeches and participate in political debates through the late 1860s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25015720P3'>Bourne was married to Anna Reber and had at least four children. His fate after 1870 is not clear.

Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.

It was fought between Union Cavalry forces commanded by Col. Benjamin H. Grierson and Confederate Cavalry forces commanded by Cols. Wirt W. Adams and Robert V. Richardson. It resulted in a Union victory. Grierson began his raid in Tennessee and moved into Mississippi with the goal of disrupting Confederate supply and communication lines and diverting Confederate forces away from Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant’s siege of Vicksburg. Grierson’s forces destroyed bridges and railroads, burned Confederate provisions, and freed slaves. The raid ended on May 2, 1863 when Grierson arrived in Union-held Baton Rouge. During the highly successful raid, Grierson’s cavalry traveled over 600 miles, took 500 Confederate prisoners, and captured over 1,000 mules. (Mississippi Encyclopedia; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
