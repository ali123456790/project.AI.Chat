                    <p xml:id='OTPS25004395P0'>Stephen Russell Mallory was a lawyer, U.S. Senator, and the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004395P1'>Born in 1812 in Trinidad, British West Indies, Mallory moved to Key West, Florida with his family in 1820. In the 1830s, he trained under Judge William Marvin, whose cases often centered around maritime law. Mallory became a prominent lawyer in Florida, and he became engaged in local politics. During the Seminole War (1835 to 1837), Mallory also served in the U.S. Army, and from 1837 to 1845, he served as a judge in Monroe County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004395P2'>From 1851 to 1861, Mallory was a Democratic U.S. Senator for Florida, and he was placed on the Committee on Naval Affairs, serving as its chairman for most of the decade. As chairman, he played a crucial role developing and expanding the U.S. Navy using the most advanced innovations of the period.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004395P3'>During the secession crisis, Mallory advocated for reconciliation but resigned from the Senate following Florida's secession in January 1861. Confederate President Jefferson Davis nominated him to serve as the Confederate Secretary of the Navy for his extensive experience in nautical affairs and his connection to Florida, which helped ensure the state was represented in Davis's cabinet. Mallory was ultimately confirmed by the Confederate Congress and served until the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004395P4'>Mallory's task was no small matter, as the Confederate Navy was essentially nonexistent at the start of the war. Although the Confederate Navy was never able to completely break the U.S. Navy's blockade, by April 1861, the <hi rend='italic'>CSS Sumter</hi> became the first Confederate raider to begin harassing U.S. shipping, and raiding continued throughout the war. However, Mallory's best known innovation was in pushing through the building of ironclad warships, the first of which was the CSS <hi rend='italic'>Virginia</hi>, famous for its clash with the U.S. ironclad the USS<hi rend='italic'>Monitor</hi> on March 9, 1862. Although the Confederate hopes for ironclads did not come to fruition, this battle and their creation marked a definitive shift in naval warfare - from wooden to armored ships. Mallory also supported other innovations, including rifled guns for the navy, the development of torpedoes (better known as mines, today), and spar torpedoes. In February 1864, the CSS <hi rend='italic'>Hunley</hi> also became the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (the USS <hi rend='italic'>Housantonic</hi>), although real credit for this particular innovation belonged to its creator Horace Lawson Hunley and the support of Confederate Army Captain Francis D. Lee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004395P5'>After the war and after President Abraham Lincoln's assassination, as a member of the Davis Cabinet, Mallory was charged with treason and was imprisoned in Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor for almost a year. On March 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson granted him a "partial parole," and in July 1866, Mallory returned home to Pensacola, Florida. Prohibited from seeking political office, Mallory resumed his law practice and frequently wrote to Florida newspapers about political matters. Although he supported Reconstruction at first, Mallory ultimately became a vocal opponent of Black voting rights and of racial equality.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25004395P6'>Mallory was married to Angela Sylvania (Moreno) Mallory. The pair had nine children, including two sons and two daughters who lived to adulthood. Stephen Russell Mallory died on November 9, 1873 in Pensacola, Escambia County, Florida and was buried in the St. Michael's Cemetery in Pensacola.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P0'>The act of beginning to fight or a period of time in a war, military engagements are also referred to as battles or skirmishes. Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70883P0'>The Confederate Navy was the military naval force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It was established by the Confederate Congress on February 21, 1861, and was primarily responsible for protecting the Confederacy’s coastlines and harbors from federal attack and disrupting the United States Navy’s blockade of Southern ports. At its creation, the Confederate Navy had thirty ships, only fourteen of which were seaworthy. In contrast, the United States Navy had approximately ninety ships ready for service. Despite manufacturing limitations, the Confederate Navy eventually increased its size to slightly over one hundred ships and approximately 5,000 sailors. Still, it could not compete directly with the Union Navy, which enlarged to more than 650 ships and around 20,000 sailors.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P1'>Because of its smaller size, the Confederate Navy sought new and unconventional methods to challenge Union naval supremacy. This included inviting privateers—privately owned ships that engaged in warfare—to attack Union ships, particularly merchant vessels, for the Confederate cause. More famously, the Confederate Navy built ironclad vessels (wooden ships protected by iron plates) and the first submarine (named the <hi rend='italic'>Hunley</hi>) in an effort to defeat Union ships through technological innovation. These efforts did not change the trajectory of the war, though, due in part to the Confederacy’s inability to build these new ships in great number and by the Union Navy’s own development of ironclad warships.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P2'>Confederate Navy ships also performed blockade running operations and attacked Union vessels traversing the Atlantic to and from Europe. These efforts were intended to open avenues for Confederate merchant vessels to carry on foreign trade and to draw Union ships away from the Confederacy’s coast. However, efforts to overcome the Union blockade proved ineffective. Federal ships managed to reduce the South’s trade to only five percent of its pre-war levels.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.
