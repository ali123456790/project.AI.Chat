<p xml:id='OTPS25007118P1'>Born on December 1, 1816, in Elbert County, Georgia, Harris graduated from the University of Georgia in 1836 and moved to Mississippi in 1840. He became a wealthy planter, owning several slaves, in Lowndes County. During the 1850s, Harris became involved in state politics, winning election to the Mississippi Senate in 1858.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25007118P2'>He held his seat until 1861 and then volunteered for military service during the first year of the Civil War. He served as a brigadier general from 1862 to 1863, leading state troops during the Vicksburg Campaign. Harris and his brigade were captured by Ulysses S. Grant’s army at Vicksburg in July 1863. He was formally exchanged as a prisoner a few weeks later and mustered out of the military. Harris remained a civilian for a year and then returned to the military in 1864, receiving a commission as a colonel in charge of forces at Macon, Mississippi. He remained there until the end of the Civil War in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25007118P3'>After the Civil War, Harris returned to his land in Lowndes County, Mississippi. He died there on November 21, 1899. Harris was married to Mary Oliver Banks and had three children who survived to adulthood. He is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51696P0'>Tullius Cicero Tupper was a general in the Mississippi militia during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P1'>Born in Barnard, Vermont, on February 9, 1809, Tupper was educated in the north and graduated from the University of Vermont before moving to Canton, Mississippi. He practiced law in Mississippi and became involved in newspaper publishing, running the <hi rend='italic'>Canton Herald</hi> in the 1830s. He became highly respected over the next two decades, serving as an advisor to Mississippi governor John J. Pettus during the secession crisis in 1860 and 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P2'>In 1862, Tupper received a commission as major general in the Mississippi militia, tasked with organizing and improving state forces at a time when most able-bodied Mississippi men who wanted to volunteer for military service were serving in the Confederate army. Tupper clashed with Pettus over the use of the state militia. He preferred to allow militia troops to return home following training and only be called into service during emergency situations. The governor wished to keep the militia units on active duty and in garrison. Additionally, Tupper resisted efforts by Confederate officials to control state military forces. In 1863, Tupper resigned his commission and spent the rest of the war at home.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P3'>Tupper died on August 14, 1866. He was married to Mary Harding Drane and had five children. He is buried in Canton City Cemetery, Canton, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.
