                    <p xml:id='OTPS94238P0'>Eugene Woldemar Hilgard was a chemist and geologist and is often credited as the “father of soil science” in the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94238P1'>Born in Zweibruecken, Bavaria, on January 5, 1833, Hilgard moved with his family to the United States in 1835. His family settled in Illinois, but Hilgard suffered from poor health—in part due to malaria—and later traveled to Washington, D.C. with is brother in pursuit of a healthier climate. Once there, he met several leading scientists and began pursuing a formal education in chemistry. During a visit to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hilgard was encouraged to return to Europe to study analytical chemistry. In 1849, he traveled to Heidelberg to meet one of his brothers studying medicine there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94238P2'>Hilgard studied in Germany and Switzerland, eventually receiving a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1853 at Heidelberg. He spent two years in Spain and Portugal, then returned to the United States and received a position as the assistant state geologist of Mississippi in 1855. He served in that position for two years before spending one year in Washington, D.C., as head of the Smithsonian Institution’s laboratory and lecturing on chemistry at the National Medical College in Washington, D.C. In 1858 he became the state geologist for Mississippi and a professor of chemistry at the University of Mississippi. He remained on the university campus during the Civil War, overseeing the use of some campus buildings as hospitals for wounded Union and Confederate soldiers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94238P3'>Hilgard remained Mississippi’s state geologist until 1873, when he moved to Michigan to take a position as professor of mineralogy, geology, zoology, and botany. Two years later, he moved again, this time to California, where he became professor of agricultural chemistry at the University of California, Berkley. He remained in that position from 1875 to 1904. In California, Hilgard oversaw the state’s agricultural experiment station and conducted numerous soil studies. His publications in Mississippi and California established him as a leading expert in soil sciences.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94238P4'>Hilgard died on January 8, 1916. He had been married to Jesusa Alexandrina Bello—the daughter of a Spanish Army officer, who Hilgard had met in Spain during his European studies as a young man. The couple had four children. Hilgard is buried in St. Mary’s Cemetery in Oakland, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P0'>By 1862 the initial waves of men who enlisted into Confederate military service diminished as enthusiasm for the war diminished, and both the Union and Confederacy enacted drafts to fill their armies. Nearly one year before the Union (March 1863), the Confederacy instituted a national draft in April 1862. There were important social implications to this policy, especially within the exemptions the Union and Confederacy provided. Similar to the Union, the Confederate act allowed drafted men to hire substitutes to serve in their place (often lower-class men willing to serve for much-needed income) and excused men from military service for medical reasons, "workers deemed necessary to maintain society," including select government employees. And unlike the Union, beginning in October 1862, men who enslaved a minimum of twenty (later fifteen) people were exempt.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P1'>The Twenty-Slave Law exemption was a reaction to President Abraham Lincoln's recent announcement of the<lb/>
Emancipation Proclamation. While many southern whites worried about enslaved people uprising with so many white men away at war, these policies cultivated a feeling among impoverished people that they were doing the majority of fighting and suffering for a “rich man's war.” Scholars like Joseph Glathaar proved this was not the case in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia where the wealthy were overrepresented compared with impoverished soldiers, but it is unclear if this was the case in areas like Mississippi, and the perception of unfair protections for the wealthy fueled resentment. (William Marvel, "A Poor Man's Fight," National Park Service)
