                    <p xml:id='OTPS25002719P0'>Martin Luther Smith was a northern-born Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P1'>Born September 9, 1819, in Danby New York, Smith graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1842. His first military assignment was as a civil engineer in the U.S. Army in Florida. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Smith served as an engineer and cartographer, drawing detailed maps for U.S. commanders, such as General Winfield Scott, during campaigns in Mexico.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P2'>Smith was still in the U.S. Army when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Although born in the north, he was sympathetic to the southern secession and the Confederacy. He had married a woman from Georgia and spent most of his military career in the south. As a result, he resigned from the army and volunteered for Confederate service. Initially commissioned a major in the engineers, he was promoted to colonel and assigned command of the Twenty-first Louisiana Infantry Regiment in February 1862. After assisting in planning the defense of New Orleans, Louisiana, Smith was promoted to brigadier general and transferred back to the engineers. In May 1862, he was placed in command of the defense of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and remained there during Ulysses S. Grant’s 1863 campaign, siege, and capture of the city. Held as a prisoner until early 1864, Smith received command of the Confederate Army’s Engineer Corps after his parole from a Union prison camp. In April 1864, he received an appointment as the chief engineer for the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee. Confederate officials then moved him to different commands, including the Army of Tennessee and then the Confederate Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. Among his last assignment was overseeing the defenses of Mobile, Alabama, under General P. G. T. Beauregard. When Union troops captured Mobile in 1865, Smith traveled to Athens, Georgia, where he surrendered in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002719P3'>After the Civil War, Smith moved to Savannah, Georgia, and began a civil engineering firm. He also served as the chief engineer of the Selma, Rome, and Dalton Railroad. Smith passed away on July 29, 1866 at the age of 46. He had been married to Sarah Evalina Nisbet and had three children. Smith is buried at Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens, Georgia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD56358P0'>The 3rd Regiment, Mississippi Infantry (Confederate) was organized in the spring of 1861 in Clarke County, Mississippi under the command of Col. John B. Deason and served in the Western Theater under Hebert's and Featherston's brigades in the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana and the Army of Tennessee. It was later commanded by Col. Thomas A. Mellon, Lt. Col. Samuel M. Dyer, and Capts. O. H. Johnston and John Saucier. It was consolidated with the 33rd and 40th Infantry Regiments to form the 3rd Regiment, Mississippi Consolidated Infantry on April 9, 1865 in Johnston County, North Carolina under the command of Col. James M. Stigler.
