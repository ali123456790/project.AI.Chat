                    <p xml:id='OTPS73091P0'>Mansfield Lovell was a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P1'>Born in Washington, D.C., on October 20, 1822, Lovell was related to some notable figures in early United States history. His father was surgeon general of the U.S. Army, and his great grandfather had been a member of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution. Lovell graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1842 and initially pursued a career with the U.S. Army. He fought in the Mexican-American War, receiving a brevet (honorary) promotion and a serious wound at the Battle of Chapultepec. After recovering from his injuries, he carried out a variety of assignments in the army until 1854, when he resigned to join a planned effort by some Americans to conquer Cuba. The plan fell apart, and Lovell moved to New York City where he took a job with the city administration.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Lovell traveled south to join the Confederacy. He was commissioned as an officer, quickly being promoted to major general in October 1861 and placed in command of Confederate forces at New Orleans, Louisiana. Lovell focused his defense of the city on from Union forces attacking overland from the north. When Union naval forces attacked the city from the south, sailing up the Mississippi River, Lovell was forced to abandon the city in early May 1862. The loss of the city to federal forces was one of the first major defeats for the Confederacy, and Lovell was vehemently criticized across the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P3'>He was then placed in command of a division under Major General Earl Van Dorn and participated in the Second Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, in October 1862. His performance was criticized, and he was relieved of command. With his reputation tarnished, mostly from the loss of New Orleans, Lovell requested a court of inquiry in hopes of justifying his previous command decisions. Indeed, the court found that he had not been guilty of any incompetence, but this did not result in any new military assignments during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P4'>After the war ended, Lovell took over a rice plantation near Savannah, Georgia. During his first year of farming, his crop was destroyed by a tidal wave, forcing him to abandon the endeavor. He moved to New York City and worked as a civil engineer and surveyor. Among his projects was clearing the East River for river traffic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73091P5'>Lovell died on October 20, 1822, in New York. He was married to Emily Maria Plympton and had one child. Lovell is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

It became the capital of French Louisiana in 1722 and continued as the capital when Louisiana achieved statehood on April 30, 1812. It became part of Orleans County (now extinct) on the same day. In 1849 it was replaced by Baton Rouge as the state capital, although it temporarily served as the capital again from 1865 until 1880. (Wikipedia; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
