                    <p xml:id='OTPS107770P0'>William Nelson Rector Beall was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS107770P1'>Born on March 20, 1825, in Bardstown, Kentucky, Beall moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, as a child with his family. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1848, and served as an officer in various infantry and cavalry units in the U.S. territories through the 1850s. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Beall resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. He initially served as a cavalry captain, but was repeatedly promoted until becoming a brigadier general in 1862 under General Earl Van Dorn in the Trans-Mississippi theater. After commanding cavalry forces at Corinth, Mississippi, Beall was then transferred to Port Hudson, Louisiana, where he was captured by Union forces in July 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS107770P2'>While imprisoned at Johnson’s Island in Ohio, Beall advocated for better treatment Confederate prisoners held by Union. Through an arrangement with federal officials, he was paroled in December 1864 and made an agent to oversee the sale of Confederate cotton in the northern states and Europe, with the profits being used to purchase supplies for Confederate prisoners. The terms of his parole required that he not aid the Confederacy or escape back to Confederate lines. With this agreement, Beall opened an office in New York City to facilitate the sale of southern cotton and the purchase and transfer of goods to Confederate prisoners held in northern camps. Shortly afterwards, in January 1865, Beall was arrested and placed in Fort Lafayette in New York due to the controversy of a Confederate general openly engaging in business in New York and from accusations that he was intentionally defrauding the United States government. However, when the promised cotton shipment arrived, federal authorities released Beall from his detention and he continued his prisoner relief efforts for the next several months.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS107770P3'>In August 1865, after the war, Beall moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and worked as a general commission merchant for several years. He died on July 26, 1883, in Tennessee. He was married to Felicia Bass and had four children. He is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

            <note resp="#U226410">Editor / Historian: This telegram is undated, but it is possible it was written sometime between April 1862 and July 9, 1863. William Nelson Rector Beall was promoted to Brigadier General in April 1862 and was captured at Port Hudson July 9, 1963. As a POW, he was held in Ohio until paroled then went to New York. </note>
