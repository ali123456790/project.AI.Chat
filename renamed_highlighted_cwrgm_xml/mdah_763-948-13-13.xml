                    <p xml:id='OTPS51696P0'>Tullius Cicero Tupper was a general in the Mississippi militia during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P1'>Born in Barnard, Vermont, on February 9, 1809, Tupper was educated in the north and graduated from the University of Vermont before moving to Canton, Mississippi. He practiced law in Mississippi and became involved in newspaper publishing, running the <hi rend='italic'>Canton Herald</hi> in the 1830s. He became highly respected over the next two decades, serving as an advisor to Mississippi governor John J. Pettus during the secession crisis in 1860 and 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P2'>In 1862, Tupper received a commission as major general in the Mississippi militia, tasked with organizing and improving state forces at a time when most able-bodied Mississippi men who wanted to volunteer for military service were serving in the Confederate army. Tupper clashed with Pettus over the use of the state militia. He preferred to allow militia troops to return home following training and only be called into service during emergency situations. The governor wished to keep the militia units on active duty and in garrison. Additionally, Tupper resisted efforts by Confederate officials to control state military forces. In 1863, Tupper resigned his commission and spent the rest of the war at home.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51696P3'>Tupper died on August 14, 1866. He was married to Mary Harding Drane and had five children. He is buried in Canton City Cemetery, Canton, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25010344P0'>Edmund Kirby Smith was a veteran of the U.S. Mexican War and a Confederate Army general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P1'>Born on May 16, 1824 in St. Augustine, Florida, Smith graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York in 1845. Smith entered the U.S. Mexican War with a rank of second lieutenant in the 7th U.S. Infantry. After the war, Smith became a teacher of mathematics at West Point, and he worked as a botanist. He pursued botany throughout the rest of his life. However, in 1855, he was appointed captain of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry and was stationed in Texas, and in May 1859, he was injured while fighting the Comanche in Kansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P2'>When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Smith was a major in the U.S. Army, and he initially refused to cooperate with Texas's secession and its order for him to surrender his troops. However, in April, he resigned his commission and entered the Confederate Army with a rank of major in the regular artillery. That same day, he was transferred to a cavalry unit, carrying the rank of lieutenant colonel. By June, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and was in command of a brigade in the Army of the Shenandoah. Wounded during the First Battle of Manassas (also known as Bull Run), Smith was reassigned to the Department of Middle and East Florida until he recovered. On October 11, he returned to active duty and was promoted to the rank of major general and was made a division commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P3'>In 1862, he was reassigned to the Army of Mississippi (also known as the Army of Tennessee) and took part in the invasion of Kentucky. Smith was awarded for his leadership during the Battle of Richmond in Kentucky (August 30, 1862), and by the end of the year, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P4'>In 1863, Smith was reassigned once again, this time relocating to Shreveport, Louisiana as commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, which included Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, western Louisiana, and the western territories. This included approximately 30,000 men under his command, and after the fall of Vicksburg, Smith was essentially cut off from the rest of the Confederacy. The area became known as "Kirby Smithdom" as a nod to Smith's reputation as a military dictator. He conducted the war west of the Mississippi largely through guerilla warfare and was unable to combat the U.S. Navy's control of the Mississippi River or aid the Confederate Army in the east. In February 1864, he was promoted to the rank of general (one of seven in the Confederate Army). He surrendered his army on May 26, 1865, making him the last full general to surrender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P5'>After the war, Smith fled the country for Cuba, but he returned to the U.S. to take the oath of allegiance on November 14, 1865. Smith returned to higher education and entered the telegraph business. From 1866 to 1868, he was president of the Atlantic and Pacific telegraph company, but the company failed. Afterward, he ran a prepatory school in New Castle, Kentucky until it burned in 1870. In the 1870s, he served in leadership positions at the University of Nashville, the Montgomery Bell Academy, and the University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee, where he was a professor of mathematics and botany.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P6'>Smith was married to Cassie (Selden) Smith. The pair had eleven children, including five sons and six daughters who lived to adulthood. Edmund Kirby Smith died on March 22, 1893 in Sewanee, Tennessee. He was buried in the University Cemetery at Sewanee, but he also has a cenotaph in the Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)
