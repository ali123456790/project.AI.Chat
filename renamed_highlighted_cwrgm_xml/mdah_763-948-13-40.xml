                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS105350P0'>Ulysses S. Grant was a Union general during the Civil War and president of the United States during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P1'>Born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, Grant’s original name was Hiram Ulysses Grant. Hiram was an ode to his maternal grandfather, but Grant preferred his middle name Ulysses. He attended various private schools and then received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He was mistakenly enrolled under the name Ulysses S. Grant. Grant kept the moniker. Because it was often written as “U. S. Grant,” he gained the nickname “Uncle Sam,” or “Sam,” by fellow cadets.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P2'>Grant was an average student but excelled in horse riding. He graduated in 1843 and was commissioned as an officer in the Fourth Infantry Regiment in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1844, he met Julia Dent, the sister of a West Point classmate and soon became engaged, before he was moved to a new post. From 1846 to 1848, Grant served in the Mexican-American War seeing action in many different battles and receiving two brevet (honorary) promotions for bravery. Upon returning from the war, in 1848, Grant married Julia. The couple eventually had four children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P3'>After the Mexican-American War, Grant carried out various army assignments, including some in California and the far west. He generally performed well, and was recognized as being a caring and considerate officer. However, in 1854, Grant began to show problems with alcohol, and after warnings by his superior officer, he resigned his military commission in July that year. He returned to his wife in St. Louis, unemployed and with little money. For the next several years, Grant struggled to make money to support his growing family. He tried and failed at farming, real estate sales, and local government service. His father-in-law gifted him a slave, a 35-year old farmhand named William Jones. Despite Grant’s financial despair, he chose to free Jones in 1859, rather than use him for labor or profit from his sale. Grant instead sold personal items, like a gold watch and at one point sold firewood on street corners in St. Louis. Finally, in 1860, he joined his father’s successful leather goods business, operated by his younger brothers in Galena, Illinois, and became financially stable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P4'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Grant volunteered for military service. With his military background, he was made colonel of the Twenty-first Illinois Infantry Regiment, and by July 1861 had been promoted to brigadier general. Showing great aptitude within the rapidly growing Union Army, Grant received another promotion in September 1861 as commander of the District of Southeast Missouri.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P5'>Grant fought his first major battle at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861. While largely a draw, it gave Grant valuable field command experience. Only three months later, he carried out a highly successful campaign against Confederate troops at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. His capture of both positions led to northern newspapers calling him “Unconditional Surrender” Grant and elevated his status in the Union, during a time when other federal armies had faced several defeats.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P6'>Grant was nearly defeated by a large Confederate army in southwestern Tennessee in April 1862, but rallied his force and counterattacked the next day, winning the Battle of Shiloh. The casualty rate shocked many in the north, but President Abraham Lincoln recognized that Grant did not quit in the face of adversity or hardship and endorsed him for higher command. In late 1862 and into 1863, Grant carried out an effort to capture Vicksburg, Mississippi, and help secure the Mississippi River for Union forces. Hindered by Confederate forces, terrain, and the elements, Grant’s army suffered through a long and tiring campaign. Yet, his tenacity and creativity, backed by a superior number of soldiers and competent subordinates like William Tecumseh Sherman, ensured victory. Grant outmaneuvered his opponents, raided Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson, and then besieged a Confederate army in Vicksburg, capturing the city on July 4, 1863, and electrifying northern morale—especially as it occurred a day after a separate Union army defeated Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P7'>Grant followed his success in Mississippi by defeating Confederate forces that had surrounded a Union army in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in 1864 was promoted to lieutenant general and made general-in-chief of the United States Army. He relocated to Virginia and over the next year carried out a bloody advance on the Confederate capital of Richmond. While Robert E. Lee effectively blocked Grant’s initial assaults in northern Virginia, Grant proved undaunted by battlefield defeats. He understood that Union armies could replenish the loss of men and supplies more easily than the Confederacy, and that each massive engagement wore down the Army of Northern Virginia. Indeed, Lee did his best to hold back Grant’s massive army, but in 1865, after months of grueling fighting, and a long siege of Petersburg, the Confederate army was forced to abandon Richmond and retreat to the southwest. Grant’s army cut off Lee’s army, forcing the south’s most famous general to surrender in April 1865 at Appomattox Court House. While several other Confederate armies across the south did not surrender until days or weeks later, Grant’s victory in Virginia effectively signaled the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P8'>Grant remained in the army immediately after the war, working closely with President Andrew Johnson after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination. However, Grant soon split from Johnson on Reconstruction and other policy matters. He was nominated by the Republican Party for president in 1868 and won, entering the White House in 1869. Grant was an honest and empathetic leader, but his administration was marred by corruption. Those controversies overshadowed some of his successes as the nation’s chief executive including greater protections for Black southerners during Reconstruction, signing the Fifteenth Amendment (which protected African American voting rights), greater protection of Native American lands, establishing Yellowstone as a national park, and advocating for civil service reform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P9'>After serving two terms as president, Grant and his wife went on a two-year world tour. The couple settled in New York City afterwards, when Grant again suffered financial loss due to an investment scam. He developed throat cancer and spent his final months writing his personal memoir. Grant finished writing only a few days before passing away, on July 23, 1885. His memoir was a financial success, providing his widow a large amount of money for retirement, and is largely recognized as one of the best autobiographies in the English language. Grant is buried in the General Grant National Memorial (also known as Grant’s Tomb) in New York City, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25013556P0'>William Wing Loring was a career soldier who served in the U.S. Army, the Confederate Army, and in the Egyptian Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P1'>Born on December 4, 1818, in Wilmington, North Carolina, Loring moved to Florida with his family as a child. He joined a Florida militia unit at fourteen years old and saw combat against Seminole Indians. At seventeen, he traveled to Texas to fight in the Texas War for Independence, but was brought back to Florida by his father. He rejoined the Florida militia and saw additional action against Seminoles. His family sent him to a boarding school in Virginia in 1837 and he spent two years at Georgetown University, before returning to Florida to study law and become a practicing attorney in 1842. Only a year later, in 1843, Loring won a seat in the Florida House of Representatives and served until 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P2'>In 1846, Loring volunteered for the U.S. Army’s new Regiment of Mounted Rifles (later the Third Cavalry Regiment). The unit was initially intended to serve in the Oregon Territory, but was rerouted to Mexico with the outbreak of the Mexican-American War. Loring fought in several battles during that conflict, receiving two brevet (honorary) promotions for bravery, first to lieutenant colonel and then colonel. He was also severely wounded in the left arm at Mexico City, requiring amputation. Despite the loss of his arm, Loring remained in military service and received orders to lead a wagon train from Missouri Oregon in 1849. He commanded U.S. Army personnel in Oregon Territory for two years and then received various assignments in army forts in other western territories. He participated in several battles against Native Americans in the 1850s and was officially promoted to colonel in 1856. At only 38 years old, he was the young colonel in the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Loring resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. He received a commission as a brigadier general and was ordered to organize and train Confederate soldiers in western Virginia. After mixed success on the battlefield there, he moved his troops to the Shenandoah Valley to link with General Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson. Unhappy with his orders to occupy Winchester, Virginia, during the winter months of early 1862, Loring bypassed Jackson’s authority and petitioned the Confederate high command for the relocation of his force. The incident led to Loring being reassigned away from the Shenandoah and eventually being sent to command a division within General John C. Pemberton’s army in Mississippi. He participated in the Vicksburg Campaign, but his division was cut off from the rest of Pemberton’s army during the Battle of Champion’s Hill and turned eastward to link up with General Joseph E. Johnston, thereby avoiding being captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. Over the next several months, Loring served as a division commander in Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas before surrendering to Union forces in 1865.

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P4'>After the Civil War, the Khedive of Egypt offered high ranking military positions to respected veterans of the recent conflict. Loring was one of around fifty Union and Confederate veterans recommended by William Tecumseh Sherman for the opportunity, and Loring received an appointment as Inspector General of the Egyptian army. He spent nearly a decade in Egypt serving in campaigns in Africa, attaining a rank equivalent to major general. Loring returned to the United States around 1878. He ran for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida, but lost. He moved to New York City and was there when he died of pneumonia on December 30, 1886. He was never married. Loring’s remains were cremated and initially buried at Grace Episcopal Church in New York City. Only a few months later, his ashes were transported for reinterment in Woodlawn Cemetery in St. Augustine, Florida. They were moved again in 1920 to the Government House in St. Augustine, with a large obelisk over his grave. A century later, in 2020, Loring’s ashes were moved one more time, to a grave on private property.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32020000P0'>Constructed in 1858, the Pearl River Cotton Factory was a textile mill opened and operated by Thomas Green in Jackson, Mississippi. It proved to be an immediate success, employing more than two hundred people and producing around 450,000 yards of cloth per year by 1860, making it the most successful mill in Mississippi. When the Civil War began, the factory started producing tent cloth and other textiles for the Confederate army. It continued production until Union forces occupied Jackson in May 1863, and burned the factory along with several other production facilities that provided supplies to the Confederacy.

Several more appeared during the next few years, and by the time Mississippi entered the Union in 1817 at least half a dozen different publications had emerged. Over the following years, newspaper companies opened as communities grew and the demand for information increased. Publishing resources (like paper and print presses) became more available aiding in the news media boom. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Mississippi towns or counties had a local newspaper, published daily or weekly. Major cities typically had more than one newspaper, often published by competing political parties. Most newspapers went out of business after only a few years; however, a few continued in print for decades, including <hi rend='italic'>The Columbus Democrat</hi> in Columbus (1836–1877), <hi rend='italic'>The Kosciusko Chronicle</hi> in Kosciusko (1846–1892), and the <hi rend='italic'>Grenada Sentinel</hi> of Grenada which started in 1868 and remained in publication until 1955. Overall, as many as two hundred different publishers started daily or weekly newspapers in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99663P0'>The term "emancipation" describes "the act of freeing a person from another person's control" (Cambridge Dictionary). In the nineteenth-century United States, this term most often referred to an enslaved person's escape from their enslaver's control and legal ownership. Self-emancipation describes "the act of an enslaved person freeing him or herself from the bondage of slavery," by a variety of means legal and extralegal. (American Battlefield Trust)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P1'>Occurring throughout the nineteenth century, self-emancipation under the law took the form of an enslaved person purchasing their own freedom through wages made performing trades outside of their enslaver's property. This process most often occurred in urban areas, particularly those in coastal regions of the U.S., but state legal restrictions made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P2'>The most extreme and least common form of self-emancipation was suicide, which many enslaved people chose rather than remaining in bondage. The most frequent method of self-emancipation, especially during the American Civil War, was to escape from an enslaver's property and flee without their permission. Many notable abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman self-emancipated by running away. Running away signaled how self-emancipation caused legal emancipation for all the enslaved in the United States. During the Civil War, so many enslaved persons self-emancipated and fled to Union lines that the U.S. government had to craft a response. That response manifested first in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later in the 13th Amendment of 1865, which abolished slavery altogether. Self-emancipation became a primary way for enslaved African Americans in the antebellum U.S. to wield agency over their lives, and their efforts eventually succeeded in producing legislative emancipation from the top down.

Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005129P0'>The Battle of Jackson was fought on May 14, 1863 in Jackson, Hinds County, Mississippi between Union forces commanded by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Confederate forces commanded by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. The battle was part of the Vicksburg Campaign and resulted in a Union victory. The Battle at Raymond, Mississippi, convinced Grant that Johnston’s force was too strong to bypass on the march to Vicksburg. He sent two corps of the Army of the Tennessee to attack Johnston’s position at Jackson. The Union forces met the Confederates on the morning of May 14. However, this was only Johnston’s rearguard as he determined Jackson could not be properly defended and had ordered a withdrawal of his forces. Around 3pm Union forces entered Jackson and raised the Stars and Stripes atop the state capitol. Not wanting to use troops for an occupation of Jackson, Grant withdrew his forces after ordering anything of military value destroyed, including factories, warehouses, and railroad rails. Johnston returned to Jackson one week after the battle. The battle separated Johnston’s forces from those of Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton at Vicksburg, preventing him from relieving the siege of the city, which fell to Union forces on July 4, 1863. After Vicksburg’s fall, Jackson would be fought over again during the Siege of Jackson on July 10 – 16, 1863, which put the city under Union control until the end of the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P0'>When the American Civil War began in the spring of 1861, many northerners and southerners expected the conflict to be short, settled after a rapid military campaign and perhaps one great battle. When those expectations proved incorrect, Union military authorities began conducting broad offensive operations designed to capture key locations within the Confederacy. The first targets held military or political value, such as fortifications, port cities, and capitals. Union armies advancing toward those objectives began capturing pro-secessionist communities. Because federal activities in the South focused on military objectives, Union armies initially had little guidance on how to govern the Confederate areas they occupied. As a result, federal officers relied upon their own interpretation of law and their military authority. Many took a conservative approach, enacting few changes to the local community, while others governed with a heavy hand—either as punishment to secessionists or to enact their favored political policies. One such example included General John C. Frémont’s declaration of martial law and emancipation of slaves in Missouri. The order was quickly overturned by President Abraham Lincoln’s administration, but the incident revealed the varied actions that occurred in pro-secessionist areas occupied by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P1'>As the war progressed, Union armies advanced deeper into the Confederacy. Lincoln began developing plans for reconstruction and reconciliation of Union-controlled areas, but restructuring local governments was only part of the effect occupation had on Southern communities. Federal armies needed supplies. Union officers acquisitioned resources within occupied areas—sometimes with payment, other times by confiscation—to feed and support their military forces. In cases where Union troops could not maintain a permanent presence, they burned or otherwise destroyed Southern crops, buildings, and railroads to deny their use by Confederates.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P2'>Union-occupied areas of the South also saw an influx of northern businessmen anxious to capitalize on Southern resources. Since the Union navy blockaded Confederate ports and prevented exports to Europe, many Southerners had surplus supplies and limited market options. Cotton speculators shadowed Union armies—and in some cases colluded with federal military officials—to negotiate with these desperate Southern planters to send their crop north. This illicit business practice became rampant in occupied areas, prompting the War Department to establish rules for business transactions within Union lines. Illegal trade continued. In December 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant issued General Orders No. 11 in response to continued concerns about market speculation in occupied portions of the Confederacy. The order was highly controversial because it unfairly blamed the Jewish population for the problematic business practices and called for the expulsion of all Jewish citizens from his military department. The Lincoln administration immediately rescinded the order, but Grant lived with the negative effects of his discriminatory proclamation for the rest of his life. The event highlighted the tensions of market speculation and illicit trade in Union occupied areas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P3'>The most significant effect Union occupation had on Southern communities was the disruption of slavery. Enslaved African Americans fled to Union armies to escape bondage. Early in the war, Union commanders had no guiding policy for handling runaway slaves. Some returned them to their owners; others, with abolitionist principles, happily facilitated their escape north or protection behind Union lines. However, in May 1861, Union general Benjamin Butler developed a new legal approach to fugitive slaves when a small number sought refuge within his lines at Union-occupied Fort Monroe, Virginia. He refused to return them to their secessionist owner, declaring them “contraband of war”—property which could be confiscated according to laws of war. News of this policy saw widespread support across the North, as punishment to secessionists but also as a practical way to deny the Confederacy its chief source of labor. The United States Congress soon followed Butler’s actions with legislation authorizing Union armies to confiscate Confederate property and slaves. As the war continued, federal policies against slavery expanded, until Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared all slaves within Confederate areas forever free. Even with Lincoln’s hope for a quick restoration and reconciliation of the Union, occupied areas of the South were forever changed during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P4'>At the end of the war, the United States Army occupied the whole South. However, sustained occupation was not possible, especially as the War Department reduced the army by discharging hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers. The army kept troops in the south to enforce federal law—especially to protect African American rights—as former Confederates began to move back into local political offices. However, their role in Southern communities declined until 1877, when southern Democrats and Republican supporters of presidential candidate Rutherford Hayes agreed upon a plan to withdraw the last United States soldiers from the South and end Reconstruction. Federal occupation of the South, which had begun in 1861 in response to secession and the Civil War, was over. (Wikipedia; National Park Service; Army Heritage Center Foundation)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P0'>The term cavalry referred to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of Civil War armies, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies typically used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P1'>Confederate cavalrymen enjoyed a reputation of superiority over their Union counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that Confederate cavalry soldiers often had to provide their own horses (something less common in the Union army) and therefore were more experienced and comfortable with their steeds. Two other theories are that Southern aristocratic culture placed higher value on horsemanship than northern communities, and that men who grew up in the South’s largely agricultural society were more familiar with horses than those from the industrial North. All of these explanations may have some merit, but exaggerate the differences between North and South, and cannot account for any great disparity in cavalry actions within the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P2'>More important reasons for Confederate cavalry’s positive reputation included some high-profile leaders and notable early war victories. J.E.B. Stuart’s battlefield success in the Eastern Theater during the first two years, coupled with his flamboyant style, made him and his horse soldiers celebrities in the South, while other cavalry commanders, like John Hunt Morgan, John Singleton Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, used aggressive and rapid cavalry raids to disrupt northern supply lines, defeat isolated federal troops, and generally tie up exponentially larger Union forces. Despite these early and famous Confederate successes, Union cavalry forces improved in quality and quantity during the course of the war, culminating in a fight to a draw at Brandy Station—the largest cavalry battle in North America—in June 1863. During the last two years of the war, Confederate cavalry did not enjoy its reputation of dominance, although it still managed to play a large role in scouting, raiding, and resisting Union forces.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69344P0'>Stemming from the first century CE, Christianity is the world's largest religion with over two billion adherents. Its largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. A large influence on American identity and thought since the nation's founding, Christianity (particularly protestant evangelicalism) spread rapidly in the first three decades of the nineteenth century in the United States due to a series of religious revivals known as the Second Great Awakening. Many Americans injected Christian beliefs and practices into many of the major social, political, and legal debates in the country, including debates over slavery (both pro and antislavery stances), education, and social reform. Christianity also became a prominent religion among the enslaved in the United States, who employed Christian rhetoric and belief in much of their social, religious, and cultural activities, and critical to enslaved people's agency and resistance.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69344P1'>American Christianity in the nineteenth century primarily emphasized both one's individual responsibility to God as well as collective responsibility for one's neighbors. Also deeply important to American Christians in the nineteenth century was millennialism, or the belief that Jesus Christ would establish a 1,000 year reign of peace on earth. These combined elements produced efforts at reform with the intent to perfect society in order to invoke that reign. Many of the enslaved, however, applied millennialism to the hope of slavery's abolition. Numerous politicians also incorporated Christian imagery and language to justify "Manifest Destiny," or the idea that the God of Christianity ordained that the United States' borders would extend from the eastern to western coasts of North America, while both the Confederate and United States governments applied Christian rhetoric to support their causes. Christianity existed and still exists in many different and often competing forms, yet the development of those forms came to define much of American culture in the nineteenth century and beyond (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 285-327; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 8; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70081P0'>Catholics are Christians within the Roman Catholic Church, the oldest denomination of Christianity, tracing its roots back to Jesus Christ and his Apostles in the first century CE. The Roman Catholic Church has a complex system of governance headed by the Papacy in the Vatican City, an independent nation within Rome, Italy, considered the world's longest continual absolute monarchy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70081P1'>In the nineteenth century United States, the Catholic population expanded dramatically in tandem with increased immigration. In the 1840s, social upheaval in Catholic-majority nations like Ireland and Germany pushed many immigrants from these nations to the United States. The ties between immigration and Catholicism in the nineteenth-century U. S. influenced the anti-immigrant "nativism" movement and the creation of the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic Know-Nothing movement in the 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70081P2'>Catholic religious affiliation also heavily influenced the religious, ethnic, and racial tensions that produced the New York Draft Riots of 1863, wherein predominantly white Irish and German-born Catholics, feeling overrepresented in the 1863 draft for the Union Army and wary of making the Civil War a fight to end slavery, rioted and set fire to many buildings in the city and committed acts of violence against African Americans. Therefore, Catholicism, like other Christian denominations in the United States, represented many complex layers of religion, race, class, ethnicity, and gender (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 822-827; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 493).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
