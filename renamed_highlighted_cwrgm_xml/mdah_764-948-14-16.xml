                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS64002P0'>William Barksdale was a U.S. congressman who later served as a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P1'>Born on August 21, 1821, in Smyrna, Tennessee, Barksdale graduated from the University of Nashville and moved to Mississippi to practice law. He eventually left his law practice to edit the <hi rend='italic'>Columbus Democrat</hi>, a pro-Democratic Party, pro-slavery newspaper in Columbus, Mississippi. During the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848, Barksdale joined the Second Mississippi Regiment, serving as a quartermaster (supply officer).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P2'>After leaving Mexico, Barksdale returned to Mississippi and entered the political arena. He supported the Compromise of 1850, the controversial agreement among northern and southern politicians over the matter of slavery in the territories won from Mexico after the Mexican-American War. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1852, and served in Congress until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Barksdale was an outspoken defender of slavery in Congress, being present in several high profile debates and incidents on Capitol Hill. This included Representative Preston Brooks’ assault upon Senator Charles Sumner in the U.S. Senate on May 22, 1856. Brooks, a pro-slavery Democrat from South Carolina, had taken offense to an anti-slavery speech by the senator from Massachusetts. He walked up behind Sumner and began beating him with his cane, nearly killing him. The “caning of Charles Sumner” marked another polarizing incident in the brewing political battle over slavery, and Barksdale was reportedly standing next to Brooks during the attack. Barksdale was part of another physical altercation between anti-slavery and pro-slavery representatives in Congress two years later. During the fight, a northern congressman tried to restrain Barksdale and inadvertently knocked his toupee off. When the Mississippian quickly and awkwardly replaced the hair piece on his head backwards, laughter broke out and ended the brawl.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P3'>After Mississippi seceded in January 1861, Barksdale resigned his seat in Congress and volunteered for state military service. He was commissioned a brigadier general and appointed adjutant general and then quartermaster general of the Mississippi Militia. Soon afterwards he transferred to the Confederate States Army as a colonel and commanded the Thirteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment at the First Battle of Bull Run. Over the next two years he participated in several other battles in the Eastern Theater, including the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. After his brigade commander was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savage’s Station, he took over command and performed well, being promoted to brigadier general and leading to the brigade proudly being known as “Barksdale’s Mississippi Brigade.” Over the next few months Barksdale led his brigade at Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P4'>Barksdale commanded his brigade at Gettysburg in July 1863. He led his troops during the sudden Confederate assault on the Union left flank on July 2, striking federal troops at the Peach Orchard and pressing them back. During the vicious fighting, Barksdale was shot in the knee, struck in the foot by a cannon ball, and then shot in the chest.  Knocked off his horse by the final wound, Barksdale reportedly told a staff officer, “I am killed! Tell my wife and children that I died fighting at my post.” He died the following day, July 3, 1863, at a Union field hospital.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS64002P5'>Barksdale was married to Narcissa Lucille Smith and had two children. He was also the older brother of Ethelbert Barksdale, who served in the Confederate Congress during the Civil War and the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1880s. Barksdale’s remains were transported from Gettysburg to Mississippi where he was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while this Company will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mis-takes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding two hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages, from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.
