                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P3'>Green died on February 13, 1893. He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25018171P0'>Jones S. Hamilton was a Confederate officer who later became a wealthy railroad investor and businessman in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P1'>Born on April 19, 1833, in Wilkinson County, Mississippi, Hamilton was educated in Mississippi and then graduated from Centenary College in Louisiana. He served as sheriff of Wilkinson County during the late 1850s but resigned the position to volunteer for Confederate military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He served in a Mississippi unit in the Army of Northern Virginia, eventually attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war, Hamilton settled in Jackson, Mississippi, and held various public positions, including the deputy state auditor, adjutant general in the Mississippi militia, and a state senator. Most notably, he gained fame and wealth through railroad projects and commercial enterprises. Hamilton was credited with driving much of the infrastructure and railroad development in southern Mississippi. He also became strongly associated with the convict leasing program, where his companies paid the state to use prisoners from Mississippi’s penitentiary as laborers on public works and construction projects. By the late nineteenth century, Hamilton was a millionaire.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P2'>Hamilton’s financial success and business methods drew criticism from some, and in the 1880s he became embroiled in a dispute with a newspaper editor named Roderick Gambrell. The feud led to a duel in which Hamilton killed Gambrell. He was acquitted, but the incident underscored the controversy surrounding him and contributed to perceptions like that written by the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg American</hi>, who noted that “no man connected with public affairs of Mississippi . . . had led a more eventful, and to a certain extent, checkered, career than Jones S. Hamilton.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P3'>Hamilton died on January 21, 1907. He had been married twice, first to Carolina Augusta Stewart in 1856, with whom he had two children. She died in 1861 and he later married Fannie Buck in 1877 and had five additional children. Hamilton is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD87503P0'>Confederate irregulars, or guerrillas, were fighters engaged in warfare outside of the formal army structure. Their organizational methods varied, from loose bands of individuals to self-named units under a semi-formal command system. Celebrated by some Southerners during the Civil War as local defense forces, guerrilla fighters were most known for engaging in non-conventional tactics, such as conducting raids and ambushes, destroying supplies, intimidating civilians, and engaging in activities contrary to laws or etiquette of conventional warfare.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD87503P1'>The most famous examples of guerrilla, or irregular, fighters in the Confederacy occurred in the border states of Missouri and Tennessee, where the civilian populations were split on the topic of secession, fostering political and military strife within those communities. However, as Union armies advanced into the Confederacy and captured secessionist communities, guerrilla activity increased and spread across much of the South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD87503P2'>Confederate and Southern state officials had a tenuous relationship with pro-secessionist irregular fighters during the Civil War. While ostensibly sharing the same political interests, and providing some tactical value to areas that lacked a large formal Confederate army presence, guerrilla operations frequently contradicted the objectives of Confederate political and military leaders. Southern civilians were often caught between Confederate guerrillas and Union soldiers, suffering harsher treatment from vengeful federals and even falling victim to criminal activity by the irregular fighters themselves. Although guerrilla activity continued throughout the Civil War, Confederate leaders, such as General Robert E. Lee, formally opposed irregular warfare in the face of defeat, largely due to its negative implications on society and reconciliation. (Wikipedia)

The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92926P0'>During the Civil War, Confederate military authorities used different levels of operational command to oversee their growing military forces and to respond to federal campaigns against the south. The military department proved to be one of the more effective levels of command for territorial areas. The department commanders reported directly to the Confederate War Department and Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Initially Confederate officials created military departments only for areas directly under federal attack. As the war developed, they created departments to cover the entire Confederacy. Confederate authorities restructured the departments as the war developed, and Union forces captured some parts of the Confederacy or military campaigns created new military needs in geographical areas. Some old departments were dissolved, or divided, and territories placed within new departments designed for contemporary needs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92926P1'>The first department to include parts of Mississippi was the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, established on October 1, 1862. It existed until January 28, 1864, when Confederate authorities created the new department of Alabama and East Mississippi. That department lasted until August 15, 1864, and the creation of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana, which lasted until May 1865 and the end of the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32130587P0'>During the American Revolution, the Continental Army created the Adjutant General and the Inspector General as two different positions within the military. The Adjutant General was the administrative and personnel support element of the military, while the Inspector General was responsible for assessing and investigating internal military matters. After American independence and the reduction of the military, the Adjutant General’s Office took over most Inspector General duties. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Union and Confederate officials had to restructure the Adjutant General and Inspector General duties to support the massive expansion of military forces. State militaries, like in Mississippi, also grew rapidly in response to the war, requiring robust administrative and inspection capabilities. Mississippi placed all of those responsibilities onto the Adjutant and Inspector General Office. The Adjutant and Inspector General, as well as his assistants, helped facilitate the recruitment, enlistment, and organization of new troops in Mississippi, as well as oversaw rules and regulations and supply issues.

Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while this company will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mis-takes or delays in the transmissions or delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding two hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages, from whatever cause they may arise, nor will it be responsible for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.
