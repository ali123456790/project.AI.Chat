                    <p xml:id='OTPS70887P0'>James Whitfield was a politician in Mississippi, who served in the state legislature and as governor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70887P1'>Born on December 15, 1791, in Elbert County, Georgia, he moved to Columbus, Mississippi, as a young man. He gained significant wealth as a businessman and planter, and became active in state politics in the 1840s. He won a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1842 and served in that body until being elected to the Mississippi Senate around 1850.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70887P2'>In 1851, the Mississippi Supreme Court passed a ruling that declared all state officers held limited terms that expired at the general election. The decision caused several vacancies, including in the governor’s office. The state senate convened and elected Whitfield as president on the twenty-first ballot in late November 1851, which placed him in line to fill the vacant gubernatorial seat. He immediately became acting governor and held that position until governor-elect Henry Foote was formally inaugurated on January 10, 1852.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70887P3'>Whitfield temporarily stepped away from politics opened an insurance company and bank in 1852 that remained profitable for nearly two decades. He donated 185 acres in northern Mississippi for the construction of the Mississippi State Hospital. In 1858, he was again elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served until 1862. He stepped away from his political and business work in 1870. Whitfield died on June 25, 1875, in Columbus. He was married to Caroline H. Dyer and had at least eight children. He is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

The department was led by the Secretary of the Treasury appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by Christopher Memminger from February 21, 1861–July 18, 1864 and later by George Trenholm (July 18, 1864–April 27, 1865) and John Henninger Reagan (April 27–May 10, 1865). The Department of Treasury was responsible to superintend the collection of the public revenue and expenditures and advising the President and the Congress on all matters related to finance.

The State Legislature appointed the State Treasurer until 1832 when the Treasurer became popularly elected to serve a two-year term (changed to four years in 1869). The State Treasurer is responsible for overseeing and maintaining Mississippi's financial records. (Wikipedia)
