                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS73484P0'>Jacob Thompson was a U.S. politician and then a Confederate official, including the leader of secret plots against the north, during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P1'>Born on May 15, 1810, in Leasburg, North Carolina, Thompson graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1831 and afterwards briefly taught there before studying law. He moved to Mississippi and became a practicing attorney in 1834. Thompson showed interest in public and political office as early as 1837, when he unsuccessfully sought the office of Mississippi attorney general. Only two years later he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served until 1851.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P2'>Thompson returned to Mississippi after the end of his last Congressional term and practiced law. He turned down an appointment to U.S. Consul to Havana, Cuba, in 1853 and then lost an 1855 U.S. Senate election to Jefferson Davis. In 1857, he accepted an appointment as U.S. Secretary of the Interior under President James Buchanan. He served in that capacity during the contentious debate over the future of slavery in the territories during the late 1850s. Thompson initially took a moderate position, arguing against northern anti-slavery agitators and southern extremists who threatened secessionists. However, he sided with the lower south following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory, and became a secession commissioner from Mississippi and went to North Carolina to encourage that state's separation from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P3'>Thompson resigned his position as Interior Secretary in January 1861 and accepted the role of Inspector General of the Confederate army. He later received an army commission and served on the staff of Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard.  Thompson participated in several campaigns in the western theater, including Vicksburg in 1863. In March 1864, he received an assignment by Confederate president Jefferson Davis to lead secret service operations in Canada. Over the next several months, he reportedly developed missions to free Confederate prisoners from Union prison camps, generate anti-war agitation among northern Democrats, foment an insurgency in parts of the northern states, and starting fires in New York City. These plans failed, but reports of his activities generated excitement and fear in northern communities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73484P4'>When the war ended in 1865, Thompson fled to England and then Canada. He later returned to the United States, when tensions had cooled and most Confederate veterans had received pardons. His Mississippi property had largely been destroyed during the Civil War, so Thompson created a new home for himself in Memphis, Tennessee. He became a board member of the University of the South. Thompson died on March 24, 1885. He was married to Catharine Jones and had at least one child. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS104338P0'>Burton Norvell Harrison was an attorney, public official, and private secretary to Confederate president Jefferson Davis during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104338P1'>Born on July 14, 1838, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Harrison attended the University of Mississippi before graduating from Yale University in 1859. He moved back to Mississippi and briefly worked as an associate professor of math at the University of Mississippi. He began studying law, but suspended his legal ambitions when the Civil War broke out. Harrison became the private secretary to Jefferson Davis in Richmond in 1862 and remained an assistant to the Confederate president until the end of the war, even being captured alongside Davis in May 1865. Harrison resumed his legal studies while being held at Fort Delaware by federal authorities for the rest of the year.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104338P2'>Upon his release from prison in 1866, Harrison moved to New York City. He became a practicing attorney there and became active in political and diplomatic matters. In 1872 he served as an envoy to the Dominican Republic and in 1875 he took a position as secretary and counsel for New York City’s Rapid Transit Commission. Harrison attended Democratic Party conventions through the 1870s, but stepped away from politics after 1880. He even rejected offers by President Grover Cleveland to serve as Assistant Secretary of State and ambassador to Italy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104338P3'>Harrison died on March 29, 1904, while visiting Washington, D.C. He was married to Constance Cary and had at least three children. He is buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia.
