                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS100344P0'>Joseph Emerson Brown was governor of Georgia during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P1'>Born on April 15, 1821, in Pickens County, South Carolina, Brown moved as a child with his family to Union County, Georgia. As a young man, he became a teacher and private tutor, and then attended Yale University to study law. He started a very successful law firm in Canton, Georgia, in 1847, accumulating wealth and prestige within the state. In 1849 he was elected to the Georgia Senate and then secured a seat as a state circuit court judge in 1855.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P2'>Brown won the 1857 gubernatorial election in Georgia, becoming governor at the age of 36. He championed public education and railroad development, appointing a savvy businessman he knew from Canton to supervise the state-owned railroad. The effort succeeded, and within three years the Western and Atlantic Railroad went from nearly bankruptcy to a financial profitable institution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P3'>Brown won reelection as governor in 1859 and was in office during the contentious presidential election of 1860. He was a Democrat and slave owner, registering nineteen enslaved African Americans in his household in 1860, and strongly supported secession when the anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won. Brown was one of the south’s leading advocates for state autonomy over federal authority. This state’s rights advocacy put him into conflict with Confederate officials during the subsequent Civil War, as Brown became a leading critic of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and policies that strengthened the government in Richmond and weakened Georgia’s military and political interests. He specifically condemned Confederate laws that allowed confiscation of goods and the impressment of slaves for Confederate labor projects. His opposition to Davis likely inspired officials in Richmond and in other southern states to oppose the Confederate government on key issues, weakening the south’s war effort.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P4'>Brown called for an end of the Civil War in late 1864, after William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union forces captured Atlanta, Georgia, and marched across the state to capture Savannah. He ordered the Georgia militia to withdraw from the military front and assist in growing crops to start rebuilding the state’s infrastructure. When the war ended in 1865, Brown was arrested by federal officials and spent several weeks imprisoned in Washington, D.C.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P5'>Upon his release from prison, Brown switched his political alliances from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. He supported President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction policies, served as a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention, and even scored an appointment as a Republican to serve as chief justice of Georgia’s Supreme Court from 1868 to 1870.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P6'>Brown left the Supreme Court to be president of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. His work there, as well as other business dealings, helped him accrue a personal wealth of over one million dollars by 1880 (nearly three million dollars in modern figures). When Reconstruction ended in 1877, he reestablished himself within the Democratic Party, winning election for the U.S. Senate from Georgia.  He remained in that seat until 1891, when he retired due to health concerns. He passed away on November 30, 1894, at the age of 73. Brown was married to Elizabeth Grisham and had at least eight children. Brown is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.
