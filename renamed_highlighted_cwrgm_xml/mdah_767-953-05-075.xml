                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32004263P0'>Stephen Dill Lee was a Confederate general and president of Mississippi State University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P1'>Born on September 22, 1833, in Charleston, South Carolina, Lee was raised and educated in the south until he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1850 and graduated in 1854. He served in the United States Army for the rest of the 1850s, with assignments in Florida, Kansas, and Dakota Territory. Lee served as a quartermaster (supply officer) during most of his assignments. When southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Lee resigned his commission and joined the Confederate cause. His first appointment, in March 1861, was as assistant adjutant general and assistant inspector general for southern forces at Charleston, South Carolina. In April 1861, he was appointed an aid to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, commander of Confederate forces at Charleston. Lee delivered Beauregard’s message to Major Robert Anderson, commander of federal troops at Fort Sumter, demanding his surrender. The subsequent Confederate bombardment and capture of the fort sparked the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P2'>Lee remained in South Carolina for most of 1861. He then received command of an artillery battery in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1862 and appointed an artillery officer in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed admirably during battles near Richmond, Virginia, in the spring of 1862. Lee was promoted and, despite a brief stint as commander of a Virginia cavalry regiment, continued to be one of the Confederacy’s best artillery officers. He fought at the Battle of Second Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, in August 1862, and played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Antietam, when his cannons engaged in heavy combat near the Dunker Church.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P3'>Following Antietam, Confederate officials promoted Lee to brigadier general and sent him to Mississippi to command of an infantry division. In late December 1862, Lee’s division held off an attack by Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman at Chickasaw Bayou, Mississippi. He took command of a Confederate brigade in January 1863, but was again called to artillery service in May 1863, when he was placed in charge of the Confederate artillery defending Vicksburg, Mississippi. His performance at the Battle of Champion Hill garnered praise, but Lee and the rest of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton’s Confederate soldiers were soon surrounded by Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army at Vicksburg and captured.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P4'>Lee was paroled by Union troops and was not allowed to return to service until formally exchanged by federal and Confederate officials. While on parole, he was promoted to major general. Released from parole in October 1863, Lee took command of cavalry troops within the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana. In May 1864, Lee was placed in overall command of the department. Confederates within his command, led by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, were victorious at the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads on June 10, 1864, but suffered a defeat at Tupelo the following month, this time with Lee on the field.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P5'>On June 23, 1864, Lee was promoted to lieutenant general. He was 30 years old, making him the youngest lieutenant general in the Confederate army. On July 26, 1864, he was given command of a corps in General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, then battling William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army near Atlanta, Georgia. He fought in numerous battles in the Atlanta area, and then during Hood’s campaign into Tennessee, sustaining wounds at least two different times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P6'>After recovering from a wound he suffered in December 1864 near Nashville, Lee was assigned to General Joseph E. Johnston’s army in the Carolinas. He fought during the final campaign in North Carolina, surrendering in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P7'>After the war, Lee moved to Columbus, Mississippi, with his wife Regina Harrison, whom he had married in February 1865 while recovering from his wound. The couple settled on a large plantation given to them by Regina’s father and had one child. Lee struggled to make the plantation financially successful. He turned to the study of agriculture, and became a strong proponent of education. Lee briefly served in the Mississippi State Senate in the late 1870s and then helped found the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (present-day Mississippi State University). In 1880 became the school’s first president, remaining in that role until 1899. Lee kept an interest in state politics, serving as a delegate in Mississippi’s Constitutional Convention in 1890, which disenfranchised thousands of Black voters and more firmly entrenched white supremacy in Mississippi society.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P8'>Lee was active in promoting the preservation of Civil War history, serving as president of the Mississippi Historical Society and president of the Vicksburg National Military Park Association. He helped organize veteran reunions, and wrote several articles about the Civil War. In 1908, he fell sick after giving a speech in Vicksburg to visiting Union veterans. He passed away on May 28, 1908. Lee is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

Slocum conducted an expedition from Vicksburg, Mississippi to destroy a bridge at Pearl River. The Union force was primarily made up of infantry and cavalry soldiers from Illinois and Wisconsin; however, it also included one African American regiment—the 3rd United States Colored Cavalry. The expedition reached Jackson and destroyed the bridge. Meanwhile, Confederate troops under Brigadier General William Wirt Adams and Brigadier General Samuel Gholson took positions outside of Jackson on the road to Clinton. The Union force attacked on July 7 and after two hours of fighting the Confederates withdrew. Slocum’s force returned to Vicksburg, having lost approximately 250 killed, wounded, or missing; Brigadier General Gholson was reportedly wounded, but total Confederate losses are not known.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

<p corresp='TTP32082325P1' xml:id='OTP32082325P1'>THE PUBLIC are notified, that in order to guard against mistakes in the transmission of messages, every message of importance ought to be repeated, by being sent back from the station at which it is to be received, to the station from which it is originally sent. Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while this Company will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mis-takes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding two hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages, from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.
