                    <p xml:id='OTPS52619P0'>William H. McCardle was a writer and newspaper editor famous for his challenges to Reconstruction policies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P1'>Born on June 1, 1815, in Maysville, Kentucky, McCardle established himself as a newspaper editor in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1839 when he became part owner of the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg Daily Whig</hi>, Mississippi’s first daily newspaper. He sold that newspaper three years later, in 1842, but continued to be heavily involved in journalism, including owning the <hi rend='italic'>Weekly True Southron</hi> in the late 1850s. McCardle served as a Confederate officer during the Civil War—and was frequently referred to as colonel or general late in life—but he came to greater fame after the Civil War as an outspoken critic of Republican Reconstruction. On November 1, 1867, federal military authorities arrested McCardle for publishing highly critical articles against U.S. officials in the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg Herald</hi> and charged him with four crimes under the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867: disturbing the peace, inciting insurrection, libel, and impeding reconstruction. He petitioned the civilian court for habeas corpus (a challenge over his confinement), but the United States District Court for Mississippi deferred to the military tribunal. McCardle then appealed his case to the United States Supreme Court.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P2'>The Supreme Court heard McCardle’s case, but before the justices rendered a decision the U.S. Congress rejected the Court’s jurisdiction over the case, according to Article III, Second 2 of the U.S. Constitution. McCardle remained imprisoned for three years, before military authorities released him without ever holding a trial.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P3'>Late in life McCardle co-authored a comprehensive history Mississippi with former governor Robert Lowry. He died on April 28, 1893, at the age of 77, in Jackson, Mississippi. McCardle was married twice, first to Emily Caroline Byrnes, with whom he had five children. Emily passed away in 1852. In 1868 he married Ann Eliza Sharp and had three more children. McCardle is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63475P0'>Thomas Walton Harris was an attorney and Confederate officer from Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63475P1'>Born on April 15, 1825, in Walton County, Georgia, he moved to Mississippi in his youth and became an attorney. Harris was active in public and political activities during the 1850s, including being elected an officer in the Mississippi militia and rising to commandant of the Division of Mississippi Volunteers in 1860. He served as a delegate to Democratic Party conventions in Mississippi and took a “states rights” position, which adopted a harder line position, and supported secessionist sentiments, during the political dispute over slavery in the United States during the 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63475P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Harris volunteered for Confederate service. He served as an officer in the Ninth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and then was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Third Battalion Mississippi Cavalry. He lost an arm due to combat during the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63475P3'>After the Civil War, Harris returned to his law practice. He made frequent speeches at political and social gatherings, and was briefly considered a candidate for attorney general and for Congress in the Greenback Party in the 1870s and 1880s. In the 1880s he formed a law partnership with former Confederate general James Ronald Chalmers in Tennessee. Harris died on April 28, 1890, at the age of 65. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Mason. She passed away in 1853. He later married Susan Watson. Harris had at least three children. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
