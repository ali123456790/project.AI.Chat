                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63158P0'>Samuel J. Gholson was a U.S. representative, U.S. district judge, and Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P1'>Born in Richmond, Kentucky, on May 19, 1808, Gholson spent much of his boyhood in Alabama. He began practicing law in Russellville, Alabama, in 1829 and shortly afterwards opened a law office in Athens, Mississippi. In 1835, he won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives. The following year, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi as a Democrat. He served until 1838, when his seat was declared vacant. In 1839, he received an appointment to a joint seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District and for the Southern District of Mississippi. Gholson served in that capacity until 1861, when Mississippi seceded. He had been a delegate to the state’s secession convention, following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory as president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P2'>Gholson volunteered for Confederate military service. Although enlisting as a private, due to his age and standing as a public official, he was quickly promoted, eventually rising to major general of Mississippi state troops in 1863. Gholson campaigned in the field during his military service, being present at the battles of Fort Donelson, Iuka, and Corinth in 1862. In 1864, he received a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate army and placed in command of cavalry troops. He was badly wounded in the arm and captured during the Battle of Egypt Station in December 1864. His injuries were so severe that Union officers reported him to be mortally wounded. In fact, Gholson survived the wound, but his arm had to be amputated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P3'>Gholson was released by Union forces in May 1865, after the war had ended. He immediately returned to state politics, winning a seat in the legislature that year. He served as the speaker of the house from 1865 to 1866, and then agitated against Republican Reconstruction over the next several years. He won election to the state legislature one more time, in 1878. Gholson died in 1883 and is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi. He had been married to Margraten Ann Ragsdale, but the couple had no surviving children.

<p xml:id='OTPS76769P1'>Born in Giles County, Tennessee, in 1825, Upshaw moved to Mississippi as a young man and studied law. He opened a law practice in Holly Springs in the mid-1840s.

<p xml:id='OTPS76769P2'>Upshaw returned to Holly Springs, Mississippi, in the late 1870s during a yellow fever epidemic and reportedly stayed to help assist victims of the disease.
