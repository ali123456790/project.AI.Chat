</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52702P1'>Born on April 12, 1827, in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Van Horne began working in telegraph offices shortly after the development of telegraphy, starting as a messenger boy and working his way to manager of various telegraph offices in Ohio, Michigan, and Alabama, by the 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52702P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Van Horne became president of the Southwestern Telegraph Company, which continued operation behind Confederate lines. After the war, he helped consolidate several telegraph companies into Western Union and became the general superintendent of the company’s southern division. He was elected to company vice president in 1878. He served in that role until retiring in the late 1890s. Van Horne passed away in 1902 near Louisville, Kentucky. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS70434P1'>The rail line ran from Mobile, Alabama, to Illinois by the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, and remained in service in the South during much of the war. Fleming was credited with continuing operations throughout the conflict to facilitate the transportation of Confederate military supplies within the South. He remained with that rail line after the war, until the early 1870s. Fleming then worked for the Alabama &amp; Chattanooga Railroad. He died on April 28, 1880, from an overdose of laudanum (opium) he used as a treatment for chronic pain. Overall, Fleming was one of the most successful and famous railroad engineers in the South during the nineteenth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P0'>The act of beginning to fight or a period of time in a war, military engagements are also referred to as battles or skirmishes. Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32005193P1'>There were approximately 10,500 engagements during the American Civil War. Fifty of them were major battles, while another one hundred were notable engagements. The rest were small battles or skirmishes. (Cambridge Dictionary; American Battlefield Trust)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32020527P0'>The Battle of Mobile Bay was fought from August 2 – 23, 1864 in Mobile Bay, Mobile and Baldwin counties, Alabama between Union naval forces commanded by RADM. David G. Farragut and land forces commanded by Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger and Confederate naval forces commanded by ADM. Franklin Buchanan and land forces commanded by Brig. Gen. Richard L. Page. The battle resulted in a significant Union victory. By summer 1864 Mobile remained the only major Confederate port not under Union control. Farragut was ordered to capture the bay and close the port. The entrance to Mobile Bay was guarded by Fort Gaines on Dauphin Island to the west and Fort Morgan at Mobile Point on the east. Additionally, the waters were seeded with torpedoes (naval mines). The battle began on August 3 when a Union force under Granger landed at Dauphin Island and began the siege of Fort Gaines. On August 5 Farragut’s Union flotilla defeated the Confederate fleet. On August 8, Fort Gaines was captured. Granger’s troops were then transported to Mobile Point and began the Siege of Fort Morgan which surrendered on August 23. With the surrender of Fort Morgan, the lower Mobile Bay came under Union control until the end of the war. The total number of forces engaged was 7,000; 5,500 Union and 1,500 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 1,822 with 322 Union and 1,500 Confederate. Additionally, the Union captured the Confederate ironclad CSS Tennessee. Control of Mobile Bay provided the Union with another entry point into the South to conduct military operations and closed the port to blockade runners, cutting off a vital supply line for the Confederacy.
