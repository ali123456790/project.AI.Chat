                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32002213P0'>Dabney Herndon Maury was a West Point instructor, military textbook author, and Confederate general. Born on May 21, 1822, in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Maury was raised by his uncle Matthew Fontaine Maury (an oceanography and naval meteorology expert) after his father, a naval officer, died in the West Indies. Maury attended the University of Virginia before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1846 and was commissioned an officer in a mounted regiment. Badly wounded in the arm during the Mexican-American War, Maury was promoted for bravery and sent home to Virginia to recuperate. After recovering from his wound, Maury was appointed an instructor at West Point, where he served from 1847 until 1852. During the 1850s, Maury returned to field service and carried out various assignments in Pacific Northwest and Texas. In the late 1850s, he was stationed at the Cavalry School at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, where he wrote <hi rend='italic'>Tactics for Mounted Rifles</hi>, which became a standard training manual for the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P1'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Maury was in New Mexico Territory serving as assistant adjutant general. He resigned from the U.S. Army and returned to Virginia to volunteer for Confederate service. He received an appointment as a colonel and eventually became chief of staff under General Earl Van Dorn in the Trans-Mississippi region. Following Van Dorn’s loss at Pea Ridge, Maury was promoted to brigadier general and given command of a division. He led troops at the Second Battle of Corinth in October 1862, and was again promoted (to major general) the following month. Maury participated in various operations in Mississippi and Alabama. During the last two years of the war he commanded the Department of the Gulf and performed well in the defense of Mobile.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P2'>At the end of the Civil War, Maury returned to Virginia and founded a school in Fredericksburg. He later pursued a business venture in New Orleans, but the effort failed and Maury struggled financially. He had much greater success as an academic, founding the Southern Historical Society in 1869 and providing many of his own writings on southern history. While articles by former Confederates published by the historical society helped establish Lost Cause mythology (the effort to celebrate the Confederacy and separate the institution of slavery from the cause of the war), Maury did not use his writings to self-promote or attack rivals. His publications were appreciated by former Confederates and former Union officers as being fair and well written. His book <hi rend='italic'>Recollections of a Virginian in the Mexican, Indian, and Civil Wars</hi>, published in 1894, received wide praise for its candor and humor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P3'>Maury maintained an interest in military training, lobbying in the 1870s to reorganize a national militia and the authoring the book <hi rend='italic'>Skirmish Drill for Mounted Troops</hi> in 1886. He also received an appointment as U.S. minister to Colombia from President Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P4'>Maury was married to Nannie Rose Mason. He had five children. Maury died on January 11, 1900, in Peoria, Illinois, at his son’s house. He is buried at Confederate Cemetery in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56587P0'>James Alexander Seddon was an American congressman and then Secretary of State of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P1'>Born near Fredericksburg, Virginia, on July 13, 1815, Seddon grew up in Virginia and graduated from the University of Virginia’s law school. After working as an attorney for several years, Seddon entered politics, winning election as a Democrat to the U. S. House of Representatives in 1845. He declined to run for reelection due to a disagreement with the Democratic platform, but returned to Congress in 1849. In 1851, Seddon left public office, citing poor health, and resided in a plantation along the James River, near Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P2'>Seddon became active in politics again in 1861, during the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. He attended a peace conference in Washington, D.C., in February 1861, which brought together representatives from the upper southern states who wished to avoid a war over secession. However, after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina, and President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down secessionist defiance of federal authority, Virginia seceded. Seddon backed the Confederate cause and served in the Confederate Congress as a representative of Virginia. In 1862, he received an appointment by Confederate president Jefferson Davis to serve as Secretary of State for the Confederacy—the fourth man to hold the position, and ultimately being the longest serving.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P3'>Seddon remained secretary until January 1, 1865, then retired and returned to his home. Union soldiers arrested him in May 1865; he spent several months in prison before being released. Seddon remained out of public life following the Civil War, dying on August 19, 1880, at the age of 65. He was married to Sarah Bruce, and had nine children. Seddon is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

On May 8, 1864 its boundaries were redefined to include parts of Tennessee. It was first commanded by Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk (January 28–May 4, 1864) and later by Maj. Gen. Stephen D.

The public are notified that in order to guard against mistakes in the transmission of messages, every message of importance ought to be repeated by being sent back from the station at which it is to be received to the station from which it is originally sent.  Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while these Companies will as heretofore use every precaution to ensure correctness, they will not be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repeated messages beyond five hundred times the amount paid for sending the message, nor will they be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated mes-sages, from whatever cause they may arise, nor the delays arising from interruptions in the workings of their Tele-graphs, nor for any mistakes or omissions of any other Company over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.  [gap] All messages will hereafter be received by these Companies for transmission subject to the above conditions.
