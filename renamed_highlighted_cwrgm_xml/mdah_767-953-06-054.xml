                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56823P0'>Thomas Hill Watts, Sr., was the governor of Alabama during the second half of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P1'>Born on January 3, 1819, near Pine Flat, Alabama, Watts graduated from the University of Virginia, studied law, and became a practice attorney in Greenville, Alabama, by 1841. He relocated to Montgomery in 1848, where his law firm thrived. Aside from his legal practice, Watts received a large amount of money as a planter, owning a large amount of land and more than 175 slaves.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P2'>Watts was a Unionist during the growing sectional conflict over slavery in the 1850s. However, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the president in November 1860, Watts joined the call for secession. He served as a delegate at the Alabama secession convention, and was among the officials who signed the ordinance of secession in January 1861. Following an unsuccessful bid for governor of Alabama in 1861, Watts raised the Seventeenth Alabama Infantry Regiment and briefly commanded it as colonel. However, he resigned in 1862 when offered the position as attorney general of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. In that role, Watts helped create the Confederate Supreme Court and defended the Confederacy’s Conscription Act of 1862 which was the first draft law in North America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P3'>In 1863, Watts resigned from the attorney general’s position to run for governor of Alabama again. He won against the incumbent, John Gill Shorter, in part due to his more nationalistic views of the Confederacy, which proved popular among many Alabama citizens who were frustrated with Shorter’s handling of state matters. He battled currency inflation issues and faced an anti-war movement in the Alabama legislature in 1864. Overall, his term in office was filled with internal strife as Union forces campaigned across the south and Confederate armies disintegrated from casualties, defeats, and desertions. He was arrested by Union officials on May 1, 1865, and spent a few weeks in prison before being paroled.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P4'>Union forces had destroyed much of Watts’ plantation and liberated his slaves during the war. He sold a great deal of his plantation to pay debts, and returned to practicing law in Montgomery. He remained active in Democratic politics and worked against Republican Reconstruction, although he did not hold major political office again.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P5'>Watts died on September 16, 1892. He was married twice, first to Eliza Brown Allen, who passed away in 1873. He then married Eleanor Clark Noyes in 1875. Watts had a total of eleven children. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Montgomery, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32002213P0'>Dabney Herndon Maury was a West Point instructor, military textbook author, and Confederate general. Born on May 21, 1822, in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Maury was raised by his uncle Matthew Fontaine Maury (an oceanography and naval meteorology expert) after his father, a naval officer, died in the West Indies. Maury attended the University of Virginia before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1846 and was commissioned an officer in a mounted regiment. Badly wounded in the arm during the Mexican-American War, Maury was promoted for bravery and sent home to Virginia to recuperate. After recovering from his wound, Maury was appointed an instructor at West Point, where he served from 1847 until 1852. During the 1850s, Maury returned to field service and carried out various assignments in Pacific Northwest and Texas. In the late 1850s, he was stationed at the Cavalry School at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, where he wrote <hi rend='italic'>Tactics for Mounted Rifles</hi>, which became a standard training manual for the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P1'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Maury was in New Mexico Territory serving as assistant adjutant general. He resigned from the U.S. Army and returned to Virginia to volunteer for Confederate service. He received an appointment as a colonel and eventually became chief of staff under General Earl Van Dorn in the Trans-Mississippi region. Following Van Dorn’s loss at Pea Ridge, Maury was promoted to brigadier general and given command of a division. He led troops at the Second Battle of Corinth in October 1862, and was again promoted (to major general) the following month. Maury participated in various operations in Mississippi and Alabama. During the last two years of the war he commanded the Department of the Gulf and performed well in the defense of Mobile.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P2'>At the end of the Civil War, Maury returned to Virginia and founded a school in Fredericksburg. He later pursued a business venture in New Orleans, but the effort failed and Maury struggled financially. He had much greater success as an academic, founding the Southern Historical Society in 1869 and providing many of his own writings on southern history. While articles by former Confederates published by the historical society helped establish Lost Cause mythology (the effort to celebrate the Confederacy and separate the institution of slavery from the cause of the war), Maury did not use his writings to self-promote or attack rivals. His publications were appreciated by former Confederates and former Union officers as being fair and well written. His book <hi rend='italic'>Recollections of a Virginian in the Mexican, Indian, and Civil Wars</hi>, published in 1894, received wide praise for its candor and humor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P3'>Maury maintained an interest in military training, lobbying in the 1870s to reorganize a national militia and the authoring the book <hi rend='italic'>Skirmish Drill for Mounted Troops</hi> in 1886. He also received an appointment as U.S. minister to Colombia from President Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P4'>Maury was married to Nannie Rose Mason. He had five children. Maury died on January 11, 1900, in Peoria, Illinois, at his son’s house. He is buried at Confederate Cemetery in Fredericksburg, Virginia.
