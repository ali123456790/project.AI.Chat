                    <p xml:id='OTPS52619P0'>William H. McCardle was a writer and newspaper editor famous for his challenges to Reconstruction policies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P1'>Born on June 1, 1815, in Maysville, Kentucky, McCardle established himself as a newspaper editor in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1839 when he became part owner of the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg Daily Whig</hi>, Mississippi’s first daily newspaper. He sold that newspaper three years later, in 1842, but continued to be heavily involved in journalism, including owning the <hi rend='italic'>Weekly True Southron</hi> in the late 1850s. McCardle served as a Confederate officer during the Civil War—and was frequently referred to as colonel or general late in life—but he came to greater fame after the Civil War as an outspoken critic of Republican Reconstruction. On November 1, 1867, federal military authorities arrested McCardle for publishing highly critical articles against U.S. officials in the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg Herald</hi> and charged him with four crimes under the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867: disturbing the peace, inciting insurrection, libel, and impeding reconstruction. He petitioned the civilian court for habeas corpus (a challenge over his confinement), but the United States District Court for Mississippi deferred to the military tribunal. McCardle then appealed his case to the United States Supreme Court.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P2'>The Supreme Court heard McCardle’s case, but before the justices rendered a decision the U.S. Congress rejected the Court’s jurisdiction over the case, according to Article III, Second 2 of the U.S. Constitution. McCardle remained imprisoned for three years, before military authorities released him without ever holding a trial.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52619P3'>Late in life McCardle co-authored a comprehensive history Mississippi with former governor Robert Lowry. He died on April 28, 1893, at the age of 77, in Jackson, Mississippi. McCardle was married twice, first to Emily Caroline Byrnes, with whom he had five children. Emily passed away in 1852. In 1868 he married Ann Eliza Sharp and had three more children. McCardle is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS95215P0'>Pierre Soule Layton was a Confederate officer and chief of ordnance of the Mississippi State Militia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P1'>Born on January 18, 1839, in Charleston, South Carolina, Layton graduated from the South Carolina State Military Academy. Shortly afterwards he moved to Mississippi and became superintendent of the Brandon State Military Institute. He served as captain in a Mississippi militia artillery unit from Brandon. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Layton volunteered for military service and was appointed chief of ordnance for the Mississippi State Militia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P2'>In the fall of 1861, he was elected lieutenant colonel of the Fourth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, which entered Confederate service and marched to Tennessee. The regiment participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson, and was captured by Ulysses S. Grant’s troops who surrounded the fort in February 1862. Layton and the other members of the regiment were held as prisoners of war until exchanged by Union and Confederate officials that fall. The Fourth Mississippi Infantry reassembled in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, in October 1862. The original commander resigned his commission and Layton was elected colonel and placed in command. Layton and the regiment participated in the Vicksburg Campaign, and was again captured by soldiers under Grant, in July 1863. After being exchanged this second time, the soldiers of the Fourth Mississippi Infantry joined Braxton Bragg’s army at Chattanooga. Layton departed the regiment by the time it participated in the Atlanta Campaign in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P3'>After the war Layton settled in Meridian, Mississippi. He held a variety of jobs, including an insurance agent, writer and editor of a newspaper, cartographer and civil engineer, and chief engineer of the Waynesboro, Pascagoula and Gulf Coast Railroad.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P4'>On November 5, 1878, Layton became involved in a deadly dispute with the sheriff of Lauderdale County, Robert Henderson. On a street in Meridian, Mississippi, Layton and Henderson engaged in a gun battle.  Henderson was shot twice in the legs, and Layton was immediately arrested.  He was subsequently convicted of assault with intent to kill. He was sentenced to seven years in the state’s penitentiary. However, he was acquitted after an appeal in 1879.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS95215P5'>Layton moved to Andalusia, Alabama, late in life and died there on April 2, 1906. His death was likely a suicide, as witnesses said he consumed a large amount of alcohol and then an ounce of laudanum (an opiate). One report noted that he apparently was experiencing family problems. Layton had been married three times, the first of which apparently ended in divorce. He had at least five children who survived to adulthood.  Layton is buried in Mount Zion Cemetery in Wayne County, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P0'>The term cavalry referred to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of Civil War armies, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies typically used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P1'>Confederate cavalrymen enjoyed a reputation of superiority over their Union counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that Confederate cavalry soldiers often had to provide their own horses (something less common in the Union army) and therefore were more experienced and comfortable with their steeds. Two other theories are that Southern aristocratic culture placed higher value on horsemanship than northern communities, and that men who grew up in the South’s largely agricultural society were more familiar with horses than those from the industrial North. All of these explanations may have some merit, but exaggerate the differences between North and South, and cannot account for any great disparity in cavalry actions within the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P2'>More important reasons for Confederate cavalry’s positive reputation included some high-profile leaders and notable early war victories. J.E.B. Stuart’s battlefield success in the Eastern Theater during the first two years, coupled with his flamboyant style, made him and his horse soldiers celebrities in the South, while other cavalry commanders, like John Hunt Morgan, John Singleton Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, used aggressive and rapid cavalry raids to disrupt northern supply lines, defeat isolated federal troops, and generally tie up exponentially larger Union forces. Despite these early and famous Confederate successes, Union cavalry forces improved in quality and quantity during the course of the war, culminating in a fight to a draw at Brandy Station—the largest cavalry battle in North America—in June 1863. During the last two years of the war, Confederate cavalry did not enjoy its reputation of dominance, although it still managed to play a large role in scouting, raiding, and resisting Union forces.
