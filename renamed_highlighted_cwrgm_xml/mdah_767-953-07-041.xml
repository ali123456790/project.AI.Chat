                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71951P0'>James Ronald Chalmers was a Confederate officer and served as a U.S. Representative for Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P1'>Born in Halifax County, Virginia, on January 11, 1831, Chalmers moved with his family to Mississippi during his youth, settling in Holly Springs. After graduating from South Carolina College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in Holly Springs in 1853. Five years later, he was elected district attorney. He was selected as a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in 1861, and helped pass the ordinance of secession which declared the state separate from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P2'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, Chalmers volunteered for military service. He was first commissioned as a captain the Confederate army and soon received a promotion to colonel of the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. After commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida, Chalmers was promoted again, to brigadier general. He performed well during the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and again during the Battle of Murfreesboro from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. In 1864, he fought in western Tennessee, including the Battle of Fort Pillow, which involved Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest murdering several African American Union prisoners. In 1865, he was placed in charge of all Mississippi cavalry in the Mississippi and western Tennessee region. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P3'>After the Civil War, Chalmers returned to Mississippi and resumed practicing law. He gained fame among white conservatives through his opposition to Republican Reconstruction, and led an armed group of Democrats to Friar’s Point in 1876 to chase away the sheriff and intimidate African Americans in the area. That same year he won a state senate seat. When Mississippi was readmitted to the Union, Chalmers won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1877 to 1880. Although he again won reelection in 1880, his Republican opponent, John R. Lynch, disputed the election results. A Congressional investigation found in favor for Lynch, but not until 1882 after Chalmers had served most of the term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P4'>Around 1882, Chalmers broke with the traditional Democratic Party in Mississippi. He ran for reelection in 1882, but as an Independent Democrat with support from some Republicans and the Greenback Party (which was a third-party political movement that focused on economic matters). A traditional Democrat candidate, Van H. Manning, won the election, but this time Chalmers contested the results. Congress decided in Chalmer’s favor and he reentered Congress in June 1884, but lost reelection later that fall.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P5'>Chalmers returned to practicing law after the 1884 election. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and died on April 29, 1882. He had been married to Rebecca Arthur; the couple had two children. Chalmers is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)
