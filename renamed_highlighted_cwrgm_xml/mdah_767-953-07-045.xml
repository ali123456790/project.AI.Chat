                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94773P0'>Leonidas Polk was a bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P1'>Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on April 10, 1806, Polk was raised and educated in North Carolina. He spent two years at the University of North Carolina before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While at West Point, Polk joined the Episcopal Church. He graduated from the military academy in July 1827 and received a commission as a U.S. Army artillery officer. Polk resigned from the army in December 1827 and entered the Virginia Theological Seminary. In 1830, shortly before he completed his religious training, he married Frances Ann Devereux. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P2'>In 1831, Pok was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal Church in 1831. The following year Polk and his wife moved to Maury County, Tennessee. He served as a priest in Columbia. During the 1830s, Polk’s personal finances grew, and he became a prominent slaveowner. By 1840, he owned 111 slaves, and by 1850 he reportedly had 400 enslaved people. In 1841, Polk was elected Bishop of Louisiana. His public standing and great wealth made him a prominent public figure outside of the church. He helped establish the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, intended to be a world-class center of higher learning for the southern, slaveholding states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P3'>In 1861, when the southern states seceded from the Union, Polk oversaw the creation of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. He wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis—a West Point classmate—to offer his services and received a commission as major general in the Confederate Army. Placed in charge of Confederate troops between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers, Polk tried to draw the neutral state of Kentucky into the Confederacy. He sent Confederate units into that state. The maneuver was a major strategic blunder, as the Kentucky legislature reacted with hostility and requested support from the Union to repel the Confederate “invaders.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P4'>Polk clashed with other Confederate generals, including his superior officer, General Albert Sidney Johnston, and submitted his letter of resignation to Jefferson Davis in November 1861. Davis rejected the resignation and Polk retained a field command. He led troops in battle against Ulysses S. Grant at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861, scoring a moral victory by repulsing Grant’s attack. However, a few days later, Polk was seriously wounded when a cannon nicknamed “Lady Polk,” in honor of his wife, exploded during a firing demonstration. He spent several weeks convalescing.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P5'>Polk returned to command in early 1862, leading Confederate soldiers at the battles of Shiloh, Perryville, and Murfreesboro. His performance during these engagements proved his bravery (helping him attain the rank of lieutenant general in October 1862), but also revealed weaknesses in handling logistics and strategy. Most significantly, he continued to engage in rivalries with other officers. He lobbied his friend Jefferson Davis to relieve General Braxton Bragg from command in the west; Bragg in return told Davis that Polk was unwilling to follow orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P6'>In the face of the high profile dispute between Bragg and Polk, in late 1863 Davis placed Polk in command of Confederate soldiers in Mississippi. The state was already partially under Union control—Vicksburg having been captured by Grant in July 1863, and the capital city of Jackson having been sacked by William Tecumseh Sherman—and Polk struggled to resist Union periodic federal raids against key Mississippi towns. Then, in May 1864, Polk received orders to join General Joseph E. Johnston in northern Georgia to repel Sherman’s advance to Atlanta. Polk was placed in command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P7'>On June 14, 1864, near Marietta, Georgia, Polk and several other high ranking Confederate officers found a good vantage point on Pine Mountain to observe Union forces. General Sherman noticed the group of Confederates through field glass. He ordered nearby Union artillery to fire on them. A battery from the First Ohio Light Artillery fired at the Confederate officers. One shell landed close by, startling the Confederates, who then began to disperse. A second shell struck Polk directly, passing through his chest from side-to-side, nearly cutting him in half.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P8'>Despite the controversies surrounding Polk as a Confederate general, he was very popular among Confederate troops. His death was widely mourned within the Confederacy. He was initially buried in Saint Paul’s Church in Augusta, Georgia. However, his remains were moved to Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1945.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

It was subdivided into the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Military Districts. Its first commander was Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton who commanded the department from October 1, 1862–December 22, 1863, and Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk later commanded it from December 23, 1863–January 27, 1864. In January 1864 Alabama was merged into the Department and it became known as the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)
