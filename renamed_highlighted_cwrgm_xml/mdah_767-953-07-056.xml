</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013693P1'>Born on December 23, 1822, in Dumfries, Virginia, Dowell became involved in telegraph work before the Civil War. When the war broke out in 1861, he served as the superintendent of the American Telegraph Company. That company was taken over by the Southern Telegraph Company, and Dowell was made general superintendent of the combined corporation in Richmond, Virginia. He continued to oversee telegraph operations within the Confederacy during the Civil War. After the conflict, Dowell became superintendent of Western Union Telegraph Company’s Southern Division. He remained in that position until he passed away on February 25, 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013693P2'>Dowell was very active as a Freemason. He was married to Margaret Ann Sewell and had at least six children. Dowell is buried at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P1'>Born in Virginia on March 17, 1823, he graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1843 and moved to Lynchburg. He received some medical training and worked as a physician, leading to his title as doctor, and served in the Virginia legislature. Morris became more prominent as a businessman involved in the American Telegraph Company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, the company broke into two corporations, and Morris was appointed president of the company’s resources in the Confederacy, under the name Southern Telegraph Company. He worked closely with Confederate officials through the war to transmit news and information through telegraph lines across the south. After the Civil War, Morris became active in the Readjuster movement in Virginia, which was a radical political effort by white and black southerners to reduce the state’s debt, invest in public education for all races, and eliminate certain racially discriminatory practices such as the poll tax.

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P3'>Morris died on December 20, 1893. He was married to Laura Page Waller and had at least six children. He is buried in Presbyterian Cemetery in Lynchburg, Virginia.

During his travel south from New York, he received a commission in the Confederate army and sent to the Army of Tennessee, where he was made chief of ordnance. He achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel and oversaw Confederate ordnance supply issues (artillery, weapons, ammunition, gun powder, etc.) in the western theater for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002458P2'>After the end of the Civil War, Kennard briefly served as adjutant general of the Mississippi militia before moving to St. Louis, Missouri, to work as an editor in a newspaper.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of Southern History</hi>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum)
