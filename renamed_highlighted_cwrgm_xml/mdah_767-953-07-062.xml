                    <p xml:id='OTPS100344P0'>Joseph Emerson Brown was governor of Georgia during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P1'>Born on April 15, 1821, in Pickens County, South Carolina, Brown moved as a child with his family to Union County, Georgia. As a young man, he became a teacher and private tutor, and then attended Yale University to study law. He started a very successful law firm in Canton, Georgia, in 1847, accumulating wealth and prestige within the state. In 1849 he was elected to the Georgia Senate and then secured a seat as a state circuit court judge in 1855.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P2'>Brown won the 1857 gubernatorial election in Georgia, becoming governor at the age of 36. He championed public education and railroad development, appointing a savvy businessman he knew from Canton to supervise the state-owned railroad. The effort succeeded, and within three years the Western and Atlantic Railroad went from nearly bankruptcy to a financial profitable institution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P3'>Brown won reelection as governor in 1859 and was in office during the contentious presidential election of 1860. He was a Democrat and slave owner, registering nineteen enslaved African Americans in his household in 1860, and strongly supported secession when the anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won. Brown was one of the south’s leading advocates for state autonomy over federal authority. This state’s rights advocacy put him into conflict with Confederate officials during the subsequent Civil War, as Brown became a leading critic of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and policies that strengthened the government in Richmond and weakened Georgia’s military and political interests. He specifically condemned Confederate laws that allowed confiscation of goods and the impressment of slaves for Confederate labor projects. His opposition to Davis likely inspired officials in Richmond and in other southern states to oppose the Confederate government on key issues, weakening the south’s war effort.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P4'>Brown called for an end of the Civil War in late 1864, after William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union forces captured Atlanta, Georgia, and marched across the state to capture Savannah. He ordered the Georgia militia to withdraw from the military front and assist in growing crops to start rebuilding the state’s infrastructure. When the war ended in 1865, Brown was arrested by federal officials and spent several weeks imprisoned in Washington, D.C.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P5'>Upon his release from prison, Brown switched his political alliances from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. He supported President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction policies, served as a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention, and even scored an appointment as a Republican to serve as chief justice of Georgia’s Supreme Court from 1868 to 1870.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P6'>Brown left the Supreme Court to be president of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. His work there, as well as other business dealings, helped him accrue a personal wealth of over one million dollars by 1880 (nearly three million dollars in modern figures). When Reconstruction ended in 1877, he reestablished himself within the Democratic Party, winning election for the U.S. Senate from Georgia.  He remained in that seat until 1891, when he retired due to health concerns. He passed away on November 30, 1894, at the age of 73. Brown was married to Elizabeth Grisham and had at least eight children. Brown is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.

<p xml:id='OTPS32013693P1'>Born on December 23, 1822, in Dumfries, Virginia, Dowell became involved in telegraph work before the Civil War. When the war broke out in 1861, he served as the superintendent of the American Telegraph Company. That company was taken over by the Southern Telegraph Company, and Dowell was made general superintendent of the combined corporation in Richmond, Virginia. He continued to oversee telegraph operations within the Confederacy during the Civil War. After the conflict, Dowell became superintendent of Western Union Telegraph Company’s Southern Division. He remained in that position until he passed away on February 25, 1876.

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P1'>Born in Virginia on March 17, 1823, he graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1843 and moved to Lynchburg. He received some medical training and worked as a physician, leading to his title as doctor, and served in the Virginia legislature. Morris became more prominent as a businessman involved in the American Telegraph Company.

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, the company broke into two corporations, and Morris was appointed president of the company’s resources in the Confederacy, under the name Southern Telegraph Company. He worked closely with Confederate officials through the war to transmit news and information through telegraph lines across the south. After the Civil War, Morris became active in the Readjuster movement in Virginia, which was a radical political effort by white and black southerners to reduce the state’s debt, invest in public education for all races, and eliminate certain racially discriminatory practices such as the poll tax.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25010344P0'>Edmund Kirby Smith was a veteran of the U.S. Mexican War and a Confederate Army general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P1'>Born on May 16, 1824 in St. Augustine, Florida, Smith graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York in 1845. Smith entered the U.S. Mexican War with a rank of second lieutenant in the 7th U.S. Infantry. After the war, Smith became a teacher of mathematics at West Point, and he worked as a botanist. He pursued botany throughout the rest of his life. However, in 1855, he was appointed captain of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry and was stationed in Texas, and in May 1859, he was injured while fighting the Comanche in Kansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P2'>When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Smith was a major in the U.S. Army, and he initially refused to cooperate with Texas's secession and its order for him to surrender his troops. However, in April, he resigned his commission and entered the Confederate Army with a rank of major in the regular artillery. That same day, he was transferred to a cavalry unit, carrying the rank of lieutenant colonel. By June, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and was in command of a brigade in the Army of the Shenandoah. Wounded during the First Battle of Manassas (also known as Bull Run), Smith was reassigned to the Department of Middle and East Florida until he recovered. On October 11, he returned to active duty and was promoted to the rank of major general and was made a division commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P3'>In 1862, he was reassigned to the Army of Mississippi (also known as the Army of Tennessee) and took part in the invasion of Kentucky. Smith was awarded for his leadership during the Battle of Richmond in Kentucky (August 30, 1862), and by the end of the year, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P4'>In 1863, Smith was reassigned once again, this time relocating to Shreveport, Louisiana as commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, which included Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, western Louisiana, and the western territories. This included approximately 30,000 men under his command, and after the fall of Vicksburg, Smith was essentially cut off from the rest of the Confederacy. The area became known as "Kirby Smithdom" as a nod to Smith's reputation as a military dictator. He conducted the war west of the Mississippi largely through guerilla warfare and was unable to combat the U.S. Navy's control of the Mississippi River or aid the Confederate Army in the east. In February 1864, he was promoted to the rank of general (one of seven in the Confederate Army). He surrendered his army on May 26, 1865, making him the last full general to surrender.

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P5'>After the war, Smith fled the country for Cuba, but he returned to the U.S. to take the oath of allegiance on November 14, 1865. Smith returned to higher education and entered the telegraph business. From 1866 to 1868, he was president of the Atlantic and Pacific telegraph company, but the company failed. Afterward, he ran a prepatory school in New Castle, Kentucky until it burned in 1870. In the 1870s, he served in leadership positions at the University of Nashville, the Montgomery Bell Academy, and the University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee, where he was a professor of mathematics and botany.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P6'>Smith was married to Cassie (Selden) Smith. The pair had eleven children, including five sons and six daughters who lived to adulthood. Edmund Kirby Smith died on March 22, 1893 in Sewanee, Tennessee. He was buried in the University Cemetery at Sewanee, but he also has a cenotaph in the Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32021788P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32021788P1'>Georgia’s militia dated back to 1733, before the American Revolution. Local units were raised and organized according to counties, all of which ultimately fell under the authority of the governor. Due to several military campaigns in the late 18th and early 19th century—including the American Revolution, War of 1812, and various military actions against Native Americans in the southeast United States—Georgia’s state government carefully regulated and funded its militia system. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Georgia had among the most well-organized and supported state militias within the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32021788P2'>In 1861, the Georgia government created three small state armies from the militia: the Georgia Army; the 4th Brigade, Georgia Volunteers, and the Georgia State Troops. However, most soldiers within these units went into Confederate service—either voluntarily, or by requisition of the Confederate government. Georgia officials opposed efforts by the Confederate government to force Georgia militia troops into national service, especially in the wake of the Conscription Act in 1862. As a result, the Georgia state government created a new militia structure in December 1863. The new model divided the state’s militia into two parts: the “Militia Proper,” which included white men between the ages of seventeen and fifty; and the “Militia Reserve,” composed of sixteen-year old boys and men between fifty and sixty years old. Georgia officials received assurances from the Confederate government that members of the state’s two militia groups would be exempt from national service. This ensured that the Georgia militia men would remain a state defense force with the governor as commander-in-chief. Georgia militia forces took part in several engagements against Union troops around Atlanta in 1864 and other parts of the state until the end of the war in 1865. (William R. Scaife and William Harris Bragg, <hi rend='italic'>Joe Brown’s Pets</hi>, 2-5; Wikipedia)

Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while these Companies will as heretofore use every precaution to insure correctness, they will not be respon-sible for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repeated messages beyond five hundred times the amount paid for sending the message, nor will they be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages, from whatever cause they may arise, nor the delays arising from interruptions in the workings of their Telegraphs, nor for any mistakes or omissions of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination. All messages will hereafter be received by these Companies for transmission subject to the above conditions.
