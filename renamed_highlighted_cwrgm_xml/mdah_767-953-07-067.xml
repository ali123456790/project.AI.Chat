                    <p xml:id='OTPS32013693P0'>James R. Dowell was an executive of the Western Union Telegraph Company in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013693P1'>Born on December 23, 1822, in Dumfries, Virginia, Dowell became involved in telegraph work before the Civil War. When the war broke out in 1861, he served as the superintendent of the American Telegraph Company. That company was taken over by the Southern Telegraph Company, and Dowell was made general superintendent of the combined corporation in Richmond, Virginia. He continued to oversee telegraph operations within the Confederacy during the Civil War. After the conflict, Dowell became superintendent of Western Union Telegraph Company’s Southern Division. He remained in that position until he passed away on February 25, 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013693P2'>Dowell was very active as a Freemason. He was married to Margaret Ann Sewell and had at least six children. Dowell is buried at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P1'>Born in Virginia on March 17, 1823, he graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1843 and moved to Lynchburg. He received some medical training and worked as a physician, leading to his title as doctor, and served in the Virginia legislature. Morris became more prominent as a businessman involved in the American Telegraph Company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, the company broke into two corporations, and Morris was appointed president of the company’s resources in the Confederacy, under the name Southern Telegraph Company. He worked closely with Confederate officials through the war to transmit news and information through telegraph lines across the south. After the Civil War, Morris became active in the Readjuster movement in Virginia, which was a radical political effort by white and black southerners to reduce the state’s debt, invest in public education for all races, and eliminate certain racially discriminatory practices such as the poll tax.

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P3'>Morris died on December 20, 1893. He was married to Laura Page Waller and had at least six children. He is buried in Presbyterian Cemetery in Lynchburg, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53994P0'>Albert Gallatin Brown was governor of Mississippi, a U.S. congressman and senator from Mississippi, and a member of the Confederate Senate. Born on May 31, 1813, in South Carolina, Brown moved with his family to Mississippi in 1823. Over the course of ten years, Brown’s family established a cotton plantation that contained 1,600 acres of land and 23 slaves. He attended Mississippi College and Jefferson College, and studied law to become a practicing attorney in 1834. A year later, he entered politics, winning a seat in Mississippi’s House of Representatives in 1835 and then serving in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1839 to 1841. He was a judge in Mississippi’s Circuit Superior Court from 1842 to 1843 and then, at the age of 31, won Mississippi’s gubernatorial election in 1843 as a Democrat. Brown was a staunch advocate of public education and successfully established the University of Mississippi, which opened in 1848.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P1'>Brown left the governor’s mansion in 1848 and returned to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served there until winning a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1854. He was an outspoken defender of slavery in Washington, D.C., in the latter half of the 1850s, even advocating the expansion of American slavery to Central America. When Mississippi seceded in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Brown resigned his seat in the Senate and returned to Mississippi to organize a militia company. He led his unit to Virginia, but was shortly afterwards elected to represent Mississippi in the Confederate Senate. He remained a member there until the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P2'>Brown was among a small number of Confederate officials who foresaw the fall of the Confederacy in the wake of the battlefield defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. He unsuccessfully recommended a negotiated settlement with the Union. When the war ended in 1865, Brown took a more reconciliatory stance to Reconstruction than many other former Confederates, recommending that the south accept emancipation. Despite having a political career during a controversial and dangerous period in American history, Brown was described as being among the most amicable and fair public figures, refusing to castigate or criticize his political opponents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P3'>After the Civil War, Brown left public life. He practiced law in Mississippi for the next fifteen years. Brown was married twice during his life, first to Elizabeth Frances Thornton Taliaferro, who died less than a year after their wedding. His second wife was Roberta Eugenia Young. The couple had one child.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P4'>Brown died of a stroke on June 12, 1880, at home in Mississippi. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.
