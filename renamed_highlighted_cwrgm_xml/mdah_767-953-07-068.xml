                    <p xml:id='OTPS32013693P0'>James R. Dowell was an executive of the Western Union Telegraph Company in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013693P1'>Born on December 23, 1822, in Dumfries, Virginia, Dowell became involved in telegraph work before the Civil War. When the war broke out in 1861, he served as the superintendent of the American Telegraph Company. That company was taken over by the Southern Telegraph Company, and Dowell was made general superintendent of the combined corporation in Richmond, Virginia. He continued to oversee telegraph operations within the Confederacy during the Civil War. After the conflict, Dowell became superintendent of Western Union Telegraph Company’s Southern Division. He remained in that position until he passed away on February 25, 1876.

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P1'>Born in Virginia on March 17, 1823, he graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1843 and moved to Lynchburg. He received some medical training and worked as a physician, leading to his title as doctor, and served in the Virginia legislature. Morris became more prominent as a businessman involved in the American Telegraph Company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013694P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, the company broke into two corporations, and Morris was appointed president of the company’s resources in the Confederacy, under the name Southern Telegraph Company. He worked closely with Confederate officials through the war to transmit news and information through telegraph lines across the south. After the Civil War, Morris became active in the Readjuster movement in Virginia, which was a radical political effort by white and black southerners to reduce the state’s debt, invest in public education for all races, and eliminate certain racially discriminatory practices such as the poll tax.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS100344P0'>Joseph Emerson Brown was governor of Georgia during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P1'>Born on April 15, 1821, in Pickens County, South Carolina, Brown moved as a child with his family to Union County, Georgia. As a young man, he became a teacher and private tutor, and then attended Yale University to study law. He started a very successful law firm in Canton, Georgia, in 1847, accumulating wealth and prestige within the state. In 1849 he was elected to the Georgia Senate and then secured a seat as a state circuit court judge in 1855.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P2'>Brown won the 1857 gubernatorial election in Georgia, becoming governor at the age of 36. He championed public education and railroad development, appointing a savvy businessman he knew from Canton to supervise the state-owned railroad. The effort succeeded, and within three years the Western and Atlantic Railroad went from nearly bankruptcy to a financial profitable institution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P3'>Brown won reelection as governor in 1859 and was in office during the contentious presidential election of 1860. He was a Democrat and slave owner, registering nineteen enslaved African Americans in his household in 1860, and strongly supported secession when the anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won. Brown was one of the south’s leading advocates for state autonomy over federal authority. This state’s rights advocacy put him into conflict with Confederate officials during the subsequent Civil War, as Brown became a leading critic of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and policies that strengthened the government in Richmond and weakened Georgia’s military and political interests. He specifically condemned Confederate laws that allowed confiscation of goods and the impressment of slaves for Confederate labor projects. His opposition to Davis likely inspired officials in Richmond and in other southern states to oppose the Confederate government on key issues, weakening the south’s war effort.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P4'>Brown called for an end of the Civil War in late 1864, after William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union forces captured Atlanta, Georgia, and marched across the state to capture Savannah. He ordered the Georgia militia to withdraw from the military front and assist in growing crops to start rebuilding the state’s infrastructure. When the war ended in 1865, Brown was arrested by federal officials and spent several weeks imprisoned in Washington, D.C.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P5'>Upon his release from prison, Brown switched his political alliances from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. He supported President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction policies, served as a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention, and even scored an appointment as a Republican to serve as chief justice of Georgia’s Supreme Court from 1868 to 1870.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100344P6'>Brown left the Supreme Court to be president of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. His work there, as well as other business dealings, helped him accrue a personal wealth of over one million dollars by 1880 (nearly three million dollars in modern figures). When Reconstruction ended in 1877, he reestablished himself within the Democratic Party, winning election for the U.S. Senate from Georgia.  He remained in that seat until 1891, when he retired due to health concerns. He passed away on November 30, 1894, at the age of 73. Brown was married to Elizabeth Grisham and had at least eight children. Brown is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25011200P0'>Josiah Gorgas was the chief ordnance officer of the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011200P1'>Born on July 1, 1818, in Pennsylvania, Gorgas graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1841. He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army’s ordnance department, responsible for weaponry, equipment, and ammunition, and served during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. He continued to serve in the army through the 1850s at various arsenals across the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011200P2'>Although Gorgas was from the north, he opposed the Republican party and its strong anti-slavery platform. Additionally, he had preferred assignments in the south and had disputes with his army leadership. Therefore, when the Civil War broke out in 1861, he resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. He accepted a position as chief of ordnance for the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia. With his years of ordnance and arsenal experience, Gorgas led the creation of the Confederacy’s armaments capability. He helped develop domestic production of weapons at places like Tredegar Iron Works in Virginia, and facilitated the importation of European firearms, despite limitations by a Union naval blockade. Gorgas is largely credited with ensuring the Confederacy did not lack the necessary weaponry to wage war during the four year conflict.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011200P3'>After the Civil War, Gorgas initially invested in iron works in Alabama, but soon afterwards became involved in university administration work. He became a chancellor of the University of the South in Tennessee in 1870 and then was elected president of the University of Alabama in 1878. Gorgas died on May 15, 1883. He was married to Amelia Gayle and had at least six children that survived to adulthood. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.
