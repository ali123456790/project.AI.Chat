                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32002147P0'>Franklin Kitchell Gardner was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P1'>Born on January 29, 1823, in New York City, Gardner graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1843. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 7th Infantry Regiment and saw combat during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. Gardner was given a brevet (honorary) promotion to first lieutenant for bravery at the Battle of Monterey, and subsequent brevet promotion to captain after his performances at Vera Cruz, Churubusco, and Molino del Rey.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P2'>After the Mexican-American War, Gardner served at a variety of different U.S. Army posts. In 1861 he was in Utah Territory, but left the army when the south seceded. His mother was from Louisiana and Gardner had married Marie-Celeste Mouton, daughter of Louisiana’s governor Alexander Mouton. He volunteered for Confederate service and was initially commissioned as a captain. He was subsequently promoted, reaching the rank of brigadier general in April 1862 and being named Chief of Cavalry under General P. G. T. Beauregard. After seeing action in the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, Gardner was placed in command of an infantry brigade. He held that command for a short time before being promoted to major general and placed in charge of Confederate fortifications around Port Hudson in Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P3'>Gardner labored to improve the defenses at Port Hudson. He unsuccessfully tried to stop Union gunboats from steaming past Confederate fortifications to threaten Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863. Then, in May 1863, Union troops under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks surrounded Port Hudson and, after a siege lasting 47 days, captured Gardner and his command. Despite his defeat, many Confederates believed Gardner had commanded the defenses of Port Hudson well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P4'>Gardner was a prisoner of war until August 1864, at which point he was formally exchanged and allowed to return to the Confederacy. He commanded troops under Lieutenant General Richard Taylor, and battled Union forces who raided Mississippi and Alabama. He surrendered to federal troops in Meridian, Mississippi, in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P5'>After the war, Gardner lived on a farm near Lafayette, Louisiana. He died on April 29, 1873, at the age of 50. His widow Marie-Celeste, with whom he had four children, lived another 40 years, dying in 1915. Gardner is buried at Saint John Cemetery in Lafayette, Louisiana.
