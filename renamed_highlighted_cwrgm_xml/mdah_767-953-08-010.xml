                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32002213P0'>Dabney Herndon Maury was a West Point instructor, military textbook author, and Confederate general. Born on May 21, 1822, in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Maury was raised by his uncle Matthew Fontaine Maury (an oceanography and naval meteorology expert) after his father, a naval officer, died in the West Indies. Maury attended the University of Virginia before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1846 and was commissioned an officer in a mounted regiment. Badly wounded in the arm during the Mexican-American War, Maury was promoted for bravery and sent home to Virginia to recuperate. After recovering from his wound, Maury was appointed an instructor at West Point, where he served from 1847 until 1852. During the 1850s, Maury returned to field service and carried out various assignments in Pacific Northwest and Texas. In the late 1850s, he was stationed at the Cavalry School at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, where he wrote <hi rend='italic'>Tactics for Mounted Rifles</hi>, which became a standard training manual for the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P1'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Maury was in New Mexico Territory serving as assistant adjutant general. He resigned from the U.S. Army and returned to Virginia to volunteer for Confederate service. He received an appointment as a colonel and eventually became chief of staff under General Earl Van Dorn in the Trans-Mississippi region. Following Van Dorn’s loss at Pea Ridge, Maury was promoted to brigadier general and given command of a division. He led troops at the Second Battle of Corinth in October 1862, and was again promoted (to major general) the following month. Maury participated in various operations in Mississippi and Alabama. During the last two years of the war he commanded the Department of the Gulf and performed well in the defense of Mobile.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P2'>At the end of the Civil War, Maury returned to Virginia and founded a school in Fredericksburg. He later pursued a business venture in New Orleans, but the effort failed and Maury struggled financially. He had much greater success as an academic, founding the Southern Historical Society in 1869 and providing many of his own writings on southern history. While articles by former Confederates published by the historical society helped establish Lost Cause mythology (the effort to celebrate the Confederacy and separate the institution of slavery from the cause of the war), Maury did not use his writings to self-promote or attack rivals. His publications were appreciated by former Confederates and former Union officers as being fair and well written. His book <hi rend='italic'>Recollections of a Virginian in the Mexican, Indian, and Civil Wars</hi>, published in 1894, received wide praise for its candor and humor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P3'>Maury maintained an interest in military training, lobbying in the 1870s to reorganize a national militia and the authoring the book <hi rend='italic'>Skirmish Drill for Mounted Troops</hi> in 1886. He also received an appointment as U.S. minister to Colombia from President Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P4'>Maury was married to Nannie Rose Mason. He had five children. Maury died on January 11, 1900, in Peoria, Illinois, at his son’s house. He is buried at Confederate Cemetery in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32002147P0'>Franklin Kitchell Gardner was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P1'>Born on January 29, 1823, in New York City, Gardner graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1843. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 7th Infantry Regiment and saw combat during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. Gardner was given a brevet (honorary) promotion to first lieutenant for bravery at the Battle of Monterey, and subsequent brevet promotion to captain after his performances at Vera Cruz, Churubusco, and Molino del Rey.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P2'>After the Mexican-American War, Gardner served at a variety of different U.S. Army posts. In 1861 he was in Utah Territory, but left the army when the south seceded. His mother was from Louisiana and Gardner had married Marie-Celeste Mouton, daughter of Louisiana’s governor Alexander Mouton. He volunteered for Confederate service and was initially commissioned as a captain. He was subsequently promoted, reaching the rank of brigadier general in April 1862 and being named Chief of Cavalry under General P. G. T. Beauregard. After seeing action in the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, Gardner was placed in command of an infantry brigade. He held that command for a short time before being promoted to major general and placed in charge of Confederate fortifications around Port Hudson in Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P3'>Gardner labored to improve the defenses at Port Hudson. He unsuccessfully tried to stop Union gunboats from steaming past Confederate fortifications to threaten Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863. Then, in May 1863, Union troops under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks surrounded Port Hudson and, after a siege lasting 47 days, captured Gardner and his command. Despite his defeat, many Confederates believed Gardner had commanded the defenses of Port Hudson well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P4'>Gardner was a prisoner of war until August 1864, at which point he was formally exchanged and allowed to return to the Confederacy. He commanded troops under Lieutenant General Richard Taylor, and battled Union forces who raided Mississippi and Alabama. He surrendered to federal troops in Meridian, Mississippi, in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P5'>After the war, Gardner lived on a farm near Lafayette, Louisiana. He died on April 29, 1873, at the age of 50. His widow Marie-Celeste, with whom he had four children, lived another 40 years, dying in 1915. Gardner is buried at Saint John Cemetery in Lafayette, Louisiana.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)
