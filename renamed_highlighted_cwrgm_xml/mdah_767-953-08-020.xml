                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99666P0'>In warfare, an army moving into an enemy’s home territory is often described as an invasion. During the American Civil War, most examples of military forces moving into enemy territory involved Union armies advancing into Confederate states. Some of these incursions were temporary, such as small cavalry raids to destroy Confederate supplies and even larger campaigns behind Confederate lines to harm Southern infrastructure (such as William T. Sherman’s “March Through Georgia”). However, Union victory in the Civil War depended upon the United States Army conducting offensive operations and occupying large portions of the South. These efforts split apart the Confederacy, placed secessionist communities back under federal control, and reduced the Confederate armies’ ability to wage war. Pro-secessionist Southerners considered these efforts to be federal invasions, and described communities captured by Union armies as being overrun. However, pro-Union Southerners cheered the arrival of Union soldiers, considering them liberators rather than invaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99666P1'>Although the Confederacy fought a defensive war, Southern military forces occasionally conducted incursions into northern communities. Robert E. Lee’s Maryland Campaign in 1862 (which culminated in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862) was seen by many Marylanders as an invasion of their state. His second offensive campaign into the North, in the summer of 1863, was widely reported in the Northern press as a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. That campaign ultimately resulted in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005147P0'>The official definition of a spy in the American Civil War was "a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy' in wartime." (Essential Civil War Curriculum) Espionage remained an important, though far from central, element of the Civil War. Throughout the war, neither the Union nor the Confederacy possessed centralized agencies for obtaining or managing intelligence. Spies typically gathered intelligence and reported it directly to commanding generals, who then parsed out the reliability of that intelligence for themselves. Neither the Union nor the Confederacy held civil laws for those caught spying and thus turned them universally over to military tribunals, where the punishment for espionage was death by hanging. While the Union and Confederacy both hanged numerous alleged spies, many times spies were treated as prisoners-of-war and exchanged like any other soldiers. The intelligence offered by spies seldom influenced the planning or outcome of battles, though in a few cases it did influence individual leaders' decision making therein.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25005147P1'>The intelligence provided by spies took many forms, including intercepting and decoding documents written in cipher, and scouting troop movements and locations. Spies hired by either government worked for a fee ($2 per day for Union spies) that, given the risk of losing their life if caught, greatly exceeded that of an enlisted soldier ($13 per month in the Union). Spying not only provided a lucrative opportunity for those who did not get caught, it also provided that opportunity to those traditionally outside the mechanisms of power. Women spied for both sides of the war, while many self-emancipated formerly-enslaved African Americans served as the primary informants for the Union. Though haphazard at first, General Joseph Hooker in 1863 established the Bureau of Military Information within the Army of the Potomac, composed of both civilians and soldiers, to spy on the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. While espionage in the American Civil War remained largely amateur throughout the Civil War, it nonetheless set the foundation upon which the U. S. military would build in future conflicts (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
