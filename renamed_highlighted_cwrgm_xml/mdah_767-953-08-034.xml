                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92926P0'>During the Civil War, Confederate military authorities used different levels of operational command to oversee their growing military forces and to respond to federal campaigns against the south. The military department proved to be one of the more effective levels of command for territorial areas. The department commanders reported directly to the Confederate War Department and Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Initially Confederate officials created military departments only for areas directly under federal attack. As the war developed, they created departments to cover the entire Confederacy. Confederate authorities restructured the departments as the war developed, and Union forces captured some parts of the Confederacy or military campaigns created new military needs in geographical areas. Some old departments were dissolved, or divided, and territories placed within new departments designed for contemporary needs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92926P1'>The first department to include parts of Mississippi was the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, established on October 1, 1862. It existed until January 28, 1864, when Confederate authorities created the new department of Alabama and East Mississippi. That department lasted until August 15, 1864, and the creation of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana, which lasted until May 1865 and the end of the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32130587P0'>During the American Revolution, the Continental Army created the Adjutant General and the Inspector General as two different positions within the military. The Adjutant General was the administrative and personnel support element of the military, while the Inspector General was responsible for assessing and investigating internal military matters. After American independence and the reduction of the military, the Adjutant General’s Office took over most Inspector General duties. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Union and Confederate officials had to restructure the Adjutant General and Inspector General duties to support the massive expansion of military forces. State militaries, like in Mississippi, also grew rapidly in response to the war, requiring robust administrative and inspection capabilities. Mississippi placed all of those responsibilities onto the Adjutant and Inspector General Office. The Adjutant and Inspector General, as well as his assistants, helped facilitate the recruitment, enlistment, and organization of new troops in Mississippi, as well as oversaw rules and regulations and supply issues.

Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message, and while this company will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmissions or delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding two hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated mes-sages from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination.
