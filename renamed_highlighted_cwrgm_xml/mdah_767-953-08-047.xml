                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32002147P0'>Franklin Kitchell Gardner was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P1'>Born on January 29, 1823, in New York City, Gardner graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1843. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 7th Infantry Regiment and saw combat during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. Gardner was given a brevet (honorary) promotion to first lieutenant for bravery at the Battle of Monterey, and subsequent brevet promotion to captain after his performances at Vera Cruz, Churubusco, and Molino del Rey.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P2'>After the Mexican-American War, Gardner served at a variety of different U.S. Army posts. In 1861 he was in Utah Territory, but left the army when the south seceded. His mother was from Louisiana and Gardner had married Marie-Celeste Mouton, daughter of Louisiana’s governor Alexander Mouton. He volunteered for Confederate service and was initially commissioned as a captain. He was subsequently promoted, reaching the rank of brigadier general in April 1862 and being named Chief of Cavalry under General P. G. T. Beauregard. After seeing action in the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, Gardner was placed in command of an infantry brigade. He held that command for a short time before being promoted to major general and placed in charge of Confederate fortifications around Port Hudson in Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P3'>Gardner labored to improve the defenses at Port Hudson. He unsuccessfully tried to stop Union gunboats from steaming past Confederate fortifications to threaten Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1863. Then, in May 1863, Union troops under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks surrounded Port Hudson and, after a siege lasting 47 days, captured Gardner and his command. Despite his defeat, many Confederates believed Gardner had commanded the defenses of Port Hudson well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P4'>Gardner was a prisoner of war until August 1864, at which point he was formally exchanged and allowed to return to the Confederacy. He commanded troops under Lieutenant General Richard Taylor, and battled Union forces who raided Mississippi and Alabama. He surrendered to federal troops in Meridian, Mississippi, in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002147P5'>After the war, Gardner lived on a farm near Lafayette, Louisiana. He died on April 29, 1873, at the age of 50. His widow Marie-Celeste, with whom he had four children, lived another 40 years, dying in 1915. Gardner is buried at Saint John Cemetery in Lafayette, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99666P0'>In warfare, an army moving into an enemy’s home territory is often described as an invasion. During the American Civil War, most examples of military forces moving into enemy territory involved Union armies advancing into Confederate states. Some of these incursions were temporary, such as small cavalry raids to destroy Confederate supplies and even larger campaigns behind Confederate lines to harm Southern infrastructure (such as William T. Sherman’s “March Through Georgia”). However, Union victory in the Civil War depended upon the United States Army conducting offensive operations and occupying large portions of the South. These efforts split apart the Confederacy, placed secessionist communities back under federal control, and reduced the Confederate armies’ ability to wage war. Pro-secessionist Southerners considered these efforts to be federal invasions, and described communities captured by Union armies as being overrun. However, pro-Union Southerners cheered the arrival of Union soldiers, considering them liberators rather than invaders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99666P1'>Although the Confederacy fought a defensive war, Southern military forces occasionally conducted incursions into northern communities. Robert E. Lee’s Maryland Campaign in 1862 (which culminated in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862) was seen by many Marylanders as an invasion of their state. His second offensive campaign into the North, in the summer of 1863, was widely reported in the Northern press as a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. That campaign ultimately resulted in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.
