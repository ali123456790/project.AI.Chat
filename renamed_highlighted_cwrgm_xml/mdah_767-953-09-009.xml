                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32049569P0'>John Bell Hood was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P1'>Born in June 1831 in Owingsville, Kentucky, Hood graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1853. Not a particularly good student, as he graduated forty-fourth out of fifty-two students, Hood was nonetheless a competent soldier, and was even offered the position of chief cavalry instructor at West Point several years later (although he turned it down). Hood was initially commissioned as a lieutenant in the Fourth U.S. Infantry Regiment, but later joined the Second U.S. Cavalry Regiment in Texas. Within that unit he served under Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston and Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee, both future Confederate generals. Hood saw his first combat while with the cavalry regiment in Texas. In 1857, he was wounded in the hand by an arrow while battling Comanches at Devil’s River, Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P2'>Hood was still on active duty with the U.S. Army when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Although his native state of Kentucky remained in the Union, he sympathized with the Confederacy and resigned his commission. He initially entered the Confederate army as a cavalry officer and won a skirmish against Union troops near Newport News, Virginia, in the summer of 1861. That September, he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the Fourth Texas Infantry Regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P3'>Hood proved to be a good and popular commander. By February 1862 he received command of a new brigade, made up mostly of Texas Regiments—leading it to be called the Texas Brigade. Promoted to brigadier general in March 1862, he personally led his Texans in several battles in Virginia that year. Confederate leaders appreciated Hood’s aggression and success, rewarding him with division command in July 1862 and the promotion to major general. He and his brigade were prominent in several notable battles, such as Second Bull Run and Antietam, earning a reputation as hard fighters. That notoriety, though, came at the cost of heavy casualties.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P4'>Hood was seriously wounded in the arm by a Union artillery shell at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. He spent several weeks recuperating in Richmond, Virginia, before being sent to Tennessee with his division to support Confederate general Braxton Bragg. He participated in the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863 and again was severely wounded in the right leg. Doctors amputated the leg four inches below the hip. Although not expected to survive the wound and surgery, Hood made a strong recovery. During his second time recuperating in Richmond, Virginia, he made a good impression on President Jefferson Davis. Additionally, Hood was promoted to lieutenant general after his actions at Chickamauga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P5'>Although missing a leg and unable to fully use his left arm, Hood returned to the field in the spring of 1864 and participated in the Confederate efforts to defend Atlanta, Georgia, from William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army. Hood’s army commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, fought a tactical withdrawal over several weeks, allowing Sherman to slowly approach the Georgia city. Hood advocated for more aggression, worried of the frequent retreats. He expressed his concerns of Johnston’s tactics to President Davis and others in Richmond. Sharing his concern, Confederate officials relieved Johnston’s from command and placed Hood in command of the Army of Tennessee. True to his reputation of aggression, Hood launched several attacks against Sherman’s army, but ultimately failed to keep the Union force from surrounding Atlanta. In September 1864, Hood abandoned the city, resulting in Sherman scoring one of the biggest Union victories of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P6'>Unable to defeat Sherman’s army in direct combat, Hood led his army north into Tennessee, intending to draw the Union troops out of Georgia. The effort did not work, though, as other Union armies moved forward to contest Hood while Sherman led most of his army in a march across Georgia to Savannah in late 1864. Hood fought seven battles in Tennessee in late 1864—the last two being costly defeats at Franklin and Nashville. Failing to achieve any notable success, Hood led his survivors to Tupelo, Mississippi, for the winter, and was relieved of his command in January 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P7'>In March 1865, Hood traveled to the Trans-Mississippi Theater, hoping to bring soldiers from the far west to support fighting in the east. However, before he could carry out his plan, Confederate forces across the south began surrendering to Union armies. Hood surrendered to federal soldiers in Natchez, Mississippi, and was paroled shortly afterwards.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P8'>Hood worked as a cotton broker and insurance executive in Louisiana after the Civil War. He began writing an autobiography, largely intended to justify his wartime actions, but did not finish the book before his death. Hood married Anna Marie Hennen in 1868 and the couple had eleven children in those ten years (including three sets of twins). In 1878, a yellow fever epidemic struck the Mississippi and Louisiana area. Hood died of the disease on August 30, 1878; his wife and his oldest daughter also passed away. Hood’s ten orphan children were adopted out to seven families. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53950P0'>Richard “Dick” Taylor was Louisiana state senator and a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P1'>Born on January 27, 1826, near Louisville, Kentucky, Richard Taylor was the son of Zachary Taylor—famed Mexican-American War general and president of the United States. Richard, who went by the nickname “Dick,” attended private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts, before attending Harvard College. He transferred to Yale for his university studies and graduated in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P2'>Taylor briefly served in the Mexican-American War under his father, but left Mexico due to health problems. He traveled to Mississippi to manage a cotton plantation owned by his family, and then moved to Louisiana after he inherited a sugar plantation following his father’s death in 1850 while president. Dick Taylor expanded the size of the Louisiana plantation property and its slave population, eventually owning around two hundred enslaved people. Taylor married Louise Marie Mythe Bringer, the daughter of a wealthy family in Louisiana, and became one of the richest men in the state. In the 1855 Taylor won a seat in the Louisiana Senate as a Whig, but changed to the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigrant political party) before joining the Democratic Party by 1860.

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P3'>When the deep southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Taylor opposed secession. However, he placed his loyalty behind the Confederacy at the outbreak of war and received a commission as colonel of the Ninth Louisiana Infantry Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Virginia, missing the First Battle of Bull Run at Manassas by only hours.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P4'>Taylor was promoted to brigadier general in October 1861 and commanded a brigade under Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in Virginia in 1862. He performed well in several battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including the First Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Port Republic. In June 1862, Taylor received a promotion to major general, making him the youngest officer of that rank in the Confederacy. The new rank led to a new assignment, which involved raising soldiers in western Louisiana. When he arrived there, Union forces already occupied several parts of the state. Taylor led Confederate troops in several battles against federal soldiers in Louisiana, and led raids against Ulysses S. Grant’s army and supplies during the Vicksburg campaign. In 1864, Taylor successfully repulsed Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’ Red River Campaign in Louisiana. However, Taylor believed he had lost a chance to decisively beat Banks due to decisions by Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P5'>In 1865, Taylor was briefly placed in command of the remnants of General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, after its disastrous Nashville campaign. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama on May 4, 1865, was paroled a few days later, and returned to Louisiana to find his sugar plantation destroyed. He moved his family to New Orleans and remained there through the Reconstruction period. After his wife died in 1875, Taylor moved with the couple’s three children to Winchester, Virginia. He passed away in 1870 while visiting a friend in New York City. Taylor is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
