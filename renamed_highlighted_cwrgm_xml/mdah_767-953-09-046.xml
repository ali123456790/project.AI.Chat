                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32022518P0'>Edward Richard Sprigg Canby was Union general during the Civil War who oversaw several military departments in the south during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P1'>Born on November 9, 1817, in Piatt’s Landing, Kentucky, Canby attended Wabash College before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1839 and was commissioned as an officer in the Second U.S. Infantry Regiment. Canby served during the Second Seminole War in Florida and the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848. He was promoted three times for bravery for his actions in Mexico, rising to the rank of brevet (honorary) lieutenant colonel. During the late 1840s and early 1850s, he served in New York and in California, often within the adjutant general’s office, handling administrative duties. During the latter part of the 1850s, Canby had assignments in Utah Territory, including campaigns during the U.S. Army’s engagements with Mormon settlers in the Utah War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P2'>Canby was in New Mexico Territory in 1861, when the Civil War broke out. Placed in command of the Department of New Mexico, his first military campaign was against Confederate forces—commanded by one of his former subordinates, Henry Sibley—for the future of the territory. Despite losing the Battle of Valverde in February 1862, Canby scored a crucial victory at the Battle of Glorieta Pass. He was promoted to brigadier general and transferred to the east where he took command of the defenses of New York City’s harbor. After several months there, Canby received an appointment as an aide to the Secretary of War. In 1864, he was promoted to major general and received a field command, relieving Union general Nathaniel P. Banks in Louisiana. Although wounded by Confederate gunfire while aboard the gunboat USS <hi rend='italic'>Cricket</hi> on a river in Arkansas, Canby remained in active service and successfully led Union troops during operations at Mobile, Alabama, in early 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P3'>Although criticized by some of his colleagues, such as Ulysses S. Grant, for being too cautious as a battlefield commander, Canby was widely recognized as an excellent administrator. He oversaw federal military control of Louisiana at the end of the war, and then saw a series of departmental commands, including over Washington, D.C., Maryland, Texas, and Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P4'>Canby’s final assignment was in the Pacific Northwest in the early 1870s, dealing more with Native Americans than post-Civil War Reconstruction. He labored to resolve a conflict between the U.S. government and the Modoc tribe, which had been relocated from California to Oregon. Choosing diplomacy, since his predecessor’s military efforts had not succeeded, Canby offered to meet with Modoc representatives on April 11, 1873, near the border of California and Oregon. Although warned that the Modoc representatives could be violent and that he should not attend the meeting without a large military guard, Canby was determined to make a sincere peace effort with a limited escort. During the meeting, Modoc representatives asked Canby to allow them to return to their preferred homeland. When he admitted that he could not guarantee their request, two Modoc men attacked Canby, shooting him twice in the head and cutting his throat. The Modocs also killed a peace commissioner that had accompanied Canby. The assassination electrified the American public against the Modocs. The U.S. Army captured the assailants and executed most of them, while the Modoc tribe was sent to reservations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P5'>Canby’s body was sent east and buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was married to Louisa Hawkins and had one child who did not survive to adulthood.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53950P0'>Richard “Dick” Taylor was Louisiana state senator and a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P1'>Born on January 27, 1826, near Louisville, Kentucky, Richard Taylor was the son of Zachary Taylor—famed Mexican-American War general and president of the United States. Richard, who went by the nickname “Dick,” attended private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts, before attending Harvard College. He transferred to Yale for his university studies and graduated in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P2'>Taylor briefly served in the Mexican-American War under his father, but left Mexico due to health problems. He traveled to Mississippi to manage a cotton plantation owned by his family, and then moved to Louisiana after he inherited a sugar plantation following his father’s death in 1850 while president. Dick Taylor expanded the size of the Louisiana plantation property and its slave population, eventually owning around two hundred enslaved people. Taylor married Louise Marie Mythe Bringer, the daughter of a wealthy family in Louisiana, and became one of the richest men in the state. In the 1855 Taylor won a seat in the Louisiana Senate as a Whig, but changed to the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigrant political party) before joining the Democratic Party by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P3'>When the deep southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Taylor opposed secession. However, he placed his loyalty behind the Confederacy at the outbreak of war and received a commission as colonel of the Ninth Louisiana Infantry Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Virginia, missing the First Battle of Bull Run at Manassas by only hours.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P4'>Taylor was promoted to brigadier general in October 1861 and commanded a brigade under Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in Virginia in 1862. He performed well in several battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including the First Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Port Republic. In June 1862, Taylor received a promotion to major general, making him the youngest officer of that rank in the Confederacy. The new rank led to a new assignment, which involved raising soldiers in western Louisiana. When he arrived there, Union forces already occupied several parts of the state. Taylor led Confederate troops in several battles against federal soldiers in Louisiana, and led raids against Ulysses S. Grant’s army and supplies during the Vicksburg campaign. In 1864, Taylor successfully repulsed Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’ Red River Campaign in Louisiana. However, Taylor believed he had lost a chance to decisively beat Banks due to decisions by Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith.

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P5'>In 1865, Taylor was briefly placed in command of the remnants of General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, after its disastrous Nashville campaign. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama on May 4, 1865, was paroled a few days later, and returned to Louisiana to find his sugar plantation destroyed. He moved his family to New Orleans and remained there through the Reconstruction period. After his wife died in 1875, Taylor moved with the couple’s three children to Winchester, Virginia. He passed away in 1870 while visiting a friend in New York City. Taylor is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD56820P0'>Salt was a vital commodity to nineteenth century Americans for its use in preserving food, especially meat, and for processing animal hides. When the Civil War broke out, Mississippi had no salt mines or salt producing company within its borders. It had relied upon salt imports from Europe or northern states. By the end of 1862, Mississippi citizens were running low on their salt reserves. The state government sent agents to Alabama, Louisiana, and Virginia—known to have their own salt works—to purchase large quantities of the substance. Only the agent sent to Louisiana was successful, returning to Mississippi with twenty tons. This amount only offered a slight reprieve to Mississippians, and the governor continued to pursue reliable options for acquiring or producing salt. The governor tried to work with foreign agents who offered to run the federal blockade in the Gulf of Mexico. The state government ultimately spent $20,000 and fifty bales of cotton for this effort, but received no salt in return. The governor also worked with some local companies in Mississippi and Alabama to produce salt locally. None of these projects provided a reliable source of salt, and some were a complete bust.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD56820P1'>In late 1863, the Mississippi government abandoned efforts to work with contractors for salt and placed $500,000 into a domestic manufacturing project. The plan involved appointing a general agent to select one or two manufacturers of salt, and then overseeing the distribution of the product to each county in the state. The agent and manufacturers were each required to give a $60,000 bond to better secure the state’s interests. This plan, along with rough refining efforts by many Mississippi communities, provided a low level of salt provisions to the state through the rest of the war.
