                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P0'>Cotton is a native plant to the Americas which produces puffy bolls of soft white fibers used for clothing and fabric production since the prehistoric era. There are two main species of cotton—distinguished primarily by their fiber length. Short staple cotton has shorter fibers but can grow across a broader geographical area in the southern United States. Long staple cotton is considered by many to produce higher quality, softer fibers, but is more tropical and frost sensitive, isolating it to the warm coastal areas of the lower south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P1'>Long staple cotton became a highly prized cash crop for seventeenth and eighteenth century farmers in the lower south, particularly along the South Carolina and Georgia coastline. Sea Island cotton was carefully cultivated and developed by planters who imported long fiber plants from Central and South America to improve the quality. This lucrative crop was labor intensive, requiring laborers to pick the bolls by hand—a task increasingly given to enslaved people. Once collected, the cotton bolls had to be processed to remove seeds so the fibers could be spun into thread and the seeds used for planting or for cottonseed oil production. Early American cotton planters used a simple cotton gin (or cotton engine), originally designed in India in the fifth century, to mechanically separate seeds from the long staple fibers. This basic gin did not work with short fiber cotton. Because of this, short staple cotton was not a popular crop during the colonial era, as the manual labor required to separate seeds from the bolls was time and cost prohibitive.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P2'>This changed in the 1790s when inventor Eli Whitney designed a new cotton gin that could efficiently separate seeds from short staple cotton. The design immediately made the heartier short fiber cotton plant a viable cash crop and spurred the expansion of cotton farming—on large plantations to small farms—across the south. The pursuit of new farmland for cotton production drove westward migration, the displacement of Native Americans in the south, and helped the creation of new states, including Alabama and Mississippi. The cotton gin only mechanized the processing of cotton. Harvesting the cotton bolls was still done by hand (machine harvesting would not become prevalent until the twentieth century). Therefore, the expansion of cotton farms across the south brought with it the rapid growth of slavery.

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P3'>Planters produced 750,000 bales of cotton in 1830. Twenty years later, in 1850, the south produced 2.85 million bales annually. In 1860, American planters delivered 5.3 million bales. At 400 pounds per bale, the United States produced more than two billion pounds of cotton in 1860. The crop dominated southern agriculture and made the United States one of the world’s top exporters of the product, chiefly to textile mills in England and France. At the eve of the Civil War, southern politicians believed the importance of the south’s cotton exports gave it diplomatic leverage over European powers. Senator James Hammond of South Carolina famously quipped that “no power on earth dares to make war upon [cotton]. Cotton is king.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P4'>Southern secessionist ideas of cotton’s diplomatic influence during the Civil War proved misplaced. The decrease of cotton exports, due to the Union naval blockade and even efforts by Confederate politicians to create international demand by burning 2.5 million bales of southern cotton, failed to coerce England or France to formally side with the Confederacy or make war upon the Union. Strong cotton crops in the 1850s had led to a surplus of cotton in Europe, and Great Britain chose to find alternate sources of cotton (such as India and Egypt) rather than engage embroil itself in the American Civil War. Some desperate southern farmers even traded with federal officials, and occupying Union forces confiscated cotton crops and transferred them north to textile manufacturers in the northeast.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P5'>After the Civil War, cotton production remained an important agricultural interest for the south. The abolition of slavery did not end the role African Americans played as the primary source of labor for cotton harvesting. Freed peoples grew their own cotton crops as tenant farmers or sharecroppers across the south through the late nineteenth century, resulting in the south continually exporting millions of bales each year. Although a lucrative crop, the cotton farmers—white and black—rarely enjoyed wealth from their labor, due to periodic market crashes and competition. Cotton farming did not substantially change until the early twentieth century with the advent of mechanized cotton harvesters. (Wikipedia; census.gov; Eugene R. Dattel, “Cotton and the Civil War,” Mississippi History Now; “Cotton Sector at a Glance,” Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P0'>Upon its creation in early 1861, the government of the Confederate States of America sought ways to generate finances to pay for it growing military forces and operations needed for the impending war against the Union. The earliest plans involved taking loans (like $500,000 borrowed from the state of Alabama) and issuing treasury bonds. The first bonds were part of the “Banker Loan” plan, which involved issuing bonds to banks and commercial businesses, who could pay with specie (or hard currency). However, Confederate officials, including the Secretary of the Treasury Christopher G. Memminger, knew these efforts would fall short of providing the Confederacy the millions of dollars needed. Many southerners did not have great amounts of cash or currency to purchase bonds. However, a significant number of white southerners did produce agricultural goods for sale and export. Therefore, in May 1861, the Confederate Congress passed legislation for the first “Produce Loan,” which authorized the Treasury Department to issue $50 million in bonds, payable at 20 years with an interest rate of eight percent, that could be purchased by southern citizens who paid for them with crops or raw goods. The Confederate Treasury did not directly accept crops for bonds with this first Produce Loan, but instead circulated subscription lists for farmers to pledge a specific portion of their products for the bond. The raw goods (most often cotton and tobacco) were placed into a warehouse and the sold by the farmer by a certain date. The net profit from that sale would then be given to the Confederate Treasury in exchange for the bond. This arrangement provided the Confederacy millions of dollars in currency in short order.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P1'>The Confederate Treasury created the Produce Loan Office to manage this new type of loan. Part of its success involved generating public interest; therefore, loan officials held rallies and events to play upon Confederate patriotism. The response was strong initially. Within a few weeks, Confederate president Jefferson Davis reported to Congress that the effort promised to raise as much as $50 million. In reality, the initial Produce Loan brought slightly less than $17 million to the Confederate Treasury, but the sudden surge of cash boosted confidence in the government and provided badly needed revenue to fund the Confederate military.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P2'>In August 1861, the Confederate Congress authorized another Produce Loan, this one for $100 million worth of treasury bonds. It functioned the same as the original $50 million Produce Loan but expanded the type of payment accepted for the bonds, including treasury notes, specie, and foreign bills of exchange. The second Produce Loan netted the Confederate government around $17.5 million. A third Produce Loan passed Congress in April 1862, this one for $250 million in bonds, which took payment options even further. This third loan accepted payment in kind—farmers or planters could directly trade cotton, tobacco, and wool for treasury bonds. The Produce Loan Office recorded nearly $36 million in revenue from this last loan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P3'>The Produce Loan Office continued to oversee produce loan operations for the Confederacy until the end of the war. It played a vital role in financing the government, and in trying to reduce inflation rates among treasury notes. Additionally, the office was tasked with managing other loan and tax efforts, such as the Cotton Loans and Tithe Taxes in 1863 and 1864, which involved the Confederate government receiving millions of dollars worth of raw goods. Overall, the Produce Loan Office oversaw the receipt of $71.5 million dollars in revenue.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P4'>The Produce Loan Office (which had officially been upgraded to a bureau in 1863) spent the last months of the war trying to sell or relocate large stores of Confederate cotton and other supplies before encroaching Union armies could capture or destroy it. With the collapse of the Confederacy, so too did the Produce Loan Office dissolve. (Michael A. Martorelli, “Financing the Civil War,” Essential Civil War Curriculum; Richard C. Todd, “The Produce Loans: A Means of Financing the Confederacy,” <hi rend='italic'>The North Carolina Historical Review</hi>, 46–74)
