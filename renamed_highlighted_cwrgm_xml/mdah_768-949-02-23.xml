                    <p xml:id='OTPS32004263P0'>Stephen Dill Lee was a Confederate general and president of Mississippi State University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P1'>Born on September 22, 1833, in Charleston, South Carolina, Lee was raised and educated in the south until he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1850 and graduated in 1854. He served in the United States Army for the rest of the 1850s, with assignments in Florida, Kansas, and Dakota Territory. Lee served as a quartermaster (supply officer) during most of his assignments. When southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Lee resigned his commission and joined the Confederate cause. His first appointment, in March 1861, was as assistant adjutant general and assistant inspector general for southern forces at Charleston, South Carolina. In April 1861, he was appointed an aid to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, commander of Confederate forces at Charleston. Lee delivered Beauregard’s message to Major Robert Anderson, commander of federal troops at Fort Sumter, demanding his surrender. The subsequent Confederate bombardment and capture of the fort sparked the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P2'>Lee remained in South Carolina for most of 1861. He then received command of an artillery battery in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1862 and appointed an artillery officer in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed admirably during battles near Richmond, Virginia, in the spring of 1862. Lee was promoted and, despite a brief stint as commander of a Virginia cavalry regiment, continued to be one of the Confederacy’s best artillery officers. He fought at the Battle of Second Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, in August 1862, and played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Antietam, when his cannons engaged in heavy combat near the Dunker Church.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P3'>Following Antietam, Confederate officials promoted Lee to brigadier general and sent him to Mississippi to command of an infantry division. In late December 1862, Lee’s division held off an attack by Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman at Chickasaw Bayou, Mississippi. He took command of a Confederate brigade in January 1863, but was again called to artillery service in May 1863, when he was placed in charge of the Confederate artillery defending Vicksburg, Mississippi. His performance at the Battle of Champion Hill garnered praise, but Lee and the rest of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton’s Confederate soldiers were soon surrounded by Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army at Vicksburg and captured.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P4'>Lee was paroled by Union troops and was not allowed to return to service until formally exchanged by federal and Confederate officials. While on parole, he was promoted to major general. Released from parole in October 1863, Lee took command of cavalry troops within the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana. In May 1864, Lee was placed in overall command of the department. Confederates within his command, led by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, were victorious at the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads on June 10, 1864, but suffered a defeat at Tupelo the following month, this time with Lee on the field.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P5'>On June 23, 1864, Lee was promoted to lieutenant general. He was 30 years old, making him the youngest lieutenant general in the Confederate army. On July 26, 1864, he was given command of a corps in General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, then battling William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army near Atlanta, Georgia. He fought in numerous battles in the Atlanta area, and then during Hood’s campaign into Tennessee, sustaining wounds at least two different times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P6'>After recovering from a wound he suffered in December 1864 near Nashville, Lee was assigned to General Joseph E. Johnston’s army in the Carolinas. He fought during the final campaign in North Carolina, surrendering in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P7'>After the war, Lee moved to Columbus, Mississippi, with his wife Regina Harrison, whom he had married in February 1865 while recovering from his wound. The couple settled on a large plantation given to them by Regina’s father and had one child. Lee struggled to make the plantation financially successful. He turned to the study of agriculture, and became a strong proponent of education. Lee briefly served in the Mississippi State Senate in the late 1870s and then helped found the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (present-day Mississippi State University). In 1880 became the school’s first president, remaining in that role until 1899. Lee kept an interest in state politics, serving as a delegate in Mississippi’s Constitutional Convention in 1890, which disenfranchised thousands of Black voters and more firmly entrenched white supremacy in Mississippi society.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P8'>Lee was active in promoting the preservation of Civil War history, serving as president of the Mississippi Historical Society and president of the Vicksburg National Military Park Association. He helped organize veteran reunions, and wrote several articles about the Civil War. In 1908, he fell sick after giving a speech in Vicksburg to visiting Union veterans. He passed away on May 28, 1908. Lee is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32122868P0'>The Trans-Mississippi Department was a geographical command of the Confederate Army established on May 26, 1862 and organized from the merger of the Trans-Mississippi District of the former Department No. 2 with the Department of Texas. It encompassed the entirety of the states of Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, and included Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) and Louisiana west of the Mississippi River. It also included the Confederate-claimed Arizona Territory (part of present-day Arizona and New Mexico), which overlapped the New Mexico Territory of the United States. It was first headquartered at Little Rock Arkansas, and later, at Alexandria and Shreveport, Louisiana. Its first commander was Brig. Gen. Paul O Hébert (May 26, 1862–June 20, 1862). It was later commanded by Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman (July 20–July 16, 1862), Lt. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes (July 16, 1862–February 9, 1863), Lt. Gen. Edmund K.

The fall of Vicksburg on July 4, 1865 gave Union forces control over the entire Mississippi River and cut off the Department from the rest of the Confederacy. With the loss of support of the Confederate government in Richmond, it established bureaus that mirrored those of the War Department to perform support functions for the Army. These bureaus were legalized by an act of the First Confederate Congress on February 17, 1864. It became defunct when it surrendered to Union forces on May 26, 1865.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70883P0'>The Confederate Navy was the military naval force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It was established by the Confederate Congress on February 21, 1861, and was primarily responsible for protecting the Confederacy’s coastlines and harbors from federal attack and disrupting the United States Navy’s blockade of Southern ports. At its creation, the Confederate Navy had thirty ships, only fourteen of which were seaworthy. In contrast, the United States Navy had approximately ninety ships ready for service. Despite manufacturing limitations, the Confederate Navy eventually increased its size to slightly over one hundred ships and approximately 5,000 sailors. Still, it could not compete directly with the Union Navy, which enlarged to more than 650 ships and around 20,000 sailors.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P1'>Because of its smaller size, the Confederate Navy sought new and unconventional methods to challenge Union naval supremacy. This included inviting privateers—privately owned ships that engaged in warfare—to attack Union ships, particularly merchant vessels, for the Confederate cause. More famously, the Confederate Navy built ironclad vessels (wooden ships protected by iron plates) and the first submarine (named the <hi rend='italic'>Hunley</hi>) in an effort to defeat Union ships through technological innovation. These efforts did not change the trajectory of the war, though, due in part to the Confederacy’s inability to build these new ships in great number and by the Union Navy’s own development of ironclad warships.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P2'>Confederate Navy ships also performed blockade running operations and attacked Union vessels traversing the Atlantic to and from Europe. These efforts were intended to open avenues for Confederate merchant vessels to carry on foreign trade and to draw Union ships away from the Confederacy’s coast. However, efforts to overcome the Union blockade proved ineffective. Federal ships managed to reduce the South’s trade to only five percent of its pre-war levels.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70883P3'>The Confederate Navy was the last vestige of the Confederacy. It ceased to exist on November 6, 1865, with the surrender of the CSS <I>Shenandoah</I> in Liverpool, England. That event also marked the end of the Civil War. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E.
