                    <p xml:id='OTPS71087P0'>Winfield Scott Featherston was a U.S. congressman from Mississippi and a general in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P1'>Born on August 8, 1820, near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Featherston volunteered for militia service as a teenager during the Second Creek War in Alabama in 1836. After that conflict, he moved to Mississippi and studied law, becoming a practicing attorney in 1840. Soon after, Featherston became involved in local politics, and won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi in 1846. He served until 1851, then returned to his home in Houston, Mississippi, after losing reelection in 1850. In 1856, he moved to Holly Springs and opened a successful law firm.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P2'>Featherston remained a political figure in Mississippi, particularly during the secession movement following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860. He traveled to Kentucky, as an agent of Mississippi, to encourage secession in that state. When the war broke out in 1861, Featherston received a commission as a colonel and took command of the Seventeenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Sent to Virginia, he led Confederate troops at the First Battle of Bull Run and Ball’s Bluff in Virginia. He was promoted to brigadier general in March 1862 and participated in several major engagements that year, including the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond, the Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P3'>In early 1863, Featherston was transferred to Mississippi. He commanded a brigade during the Vicksburg campaign, seeing combat at Champion’s Hill, and participated in the Atlanta Campaign in 1864. He remained with General John Bell Hood’s army during the disastrous campaign into Tennessee in late 1864, and commanded a brigade in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army during the final weeks of the war in the Carolinas. He surrendered to Union troops in late April 1865, was paroled shortly afterwards, and returned to Holly Springs, Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P4'>Featherston immediately returned to politics after the war, running an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate. He practiced law, and remained active in local political activities opposing Republican Reconstruction. In 1876, he won a seat in the Mississippi legislature and remained there until 1882, when he received an appointment as a district judge. One of his final political acts was as a delegate to Mississippi’s 1890 constitutional convention, which reinstituted many discriminatory policies against African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P5'>Featherston was married to Elizabeth McEwen and had seven children. He died in 1891 and is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

Whether you accept his proposition or mine we will operate under the same contract.
