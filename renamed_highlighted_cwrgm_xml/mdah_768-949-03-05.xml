                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94773P0'>Leonidas Polk was a bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P1'>Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on April 10, 1806, Polk was raised and educated in North Carolina. He spent two years at the University of North Carolina before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While at West Point, Polk joined the Episcopal Church. He graduated from the military academy in July 1827 and received a commission as a U.S. Army artillery officer. Polk resigned from the army in December 1827 and entered the Virginia Theological Seminary. In 1830, shortly before he completed his religious training, he married Frances Ann Devereux. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P2'>In 1831, Pok was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal Church in 1831. The following year Polk and his wife moved to Maury County, Tennessee. He served as a priest in Columbia. During the 1830s, Polk’s personal finances grew, and he became a prominent slaveowner. By 1840, he owned 111 slaves, and by 1850 he reportedly had 400 enslaved people. In 1841, Polk was elected Bishop of Louisiana. His public standing and great wealth made him a prominent public figure outside of the church. He helped establish the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, intended to be a world-class center of higher learning for the southern, slaveholding states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P3'>In 1861, when the southern states seceded from the Union, Polk oversaw the creation of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. He wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis—a West Point classmate—to offer his services and received a commission as major general in the Confederate Army. Placed in charge of Confederate troops between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers, Polk tried to draw the neutral state of Kentucky into the Confederacy. He sent Confederate units into that state. The maneuver was a major strategic blunder, as the Kentucky legislature reacted with hostility and requested support from the Union to repel the Confederate “invaders.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P4'>Polk clashed with other Confederate generals, including his superior officer, General Albert Sidney Johnston, and submitted his letter of resignation to Jefferson Davis in November 1861. Davis rejected the resignation and Polk retained a field command. He led troops in battle against Ulysses S. Grant at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861, scoring a moral victory by repulsing Grant’s attack. However, a few days later, Polk was seriously wounded when a cannon nicknamed “Lady Polk,” in honor of his wife, exploded during a firing demonstration. He spent several weeks convalescing.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P5'>Polk returned to command in early 1862, leading Confederate soldiers at the battles of Shiloh, Perryville, and Murfreesboro. His performance during these engagements proved his bravery (helping him attain the rank of lieutenant general in October 1862), but also revealed weaknesses in handling logistics and strategy. Most significantly, he continued to engage in rivalries with other officers. He lobbied his friend Jefferson Davis to relieve General Braxton Bragg from command in the west; Bragg in return told Davis that Polk was unwilling to follow orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P6'>In the face of the high profile dispute between Bragg and Polk, in late 1863 Davis placed Polk in command of Confederate soldiers in Mississippi. The state was already partially under Union control—Vicksburg having been captured by Grant in July 1863, and the capital city of Jackson having been sacked by William Tecumseh Sherman—and Polk struggled to resist Union periodic federal raids against key Mississippi towns. Then, in May 1864, Polk received orders to join General Joseph E. Johnston in northern Georgia to repel Sherman’s advance to Atlanta. Polk was placed in command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P7'>On June 14, 1864, near Marietta, Georgia, Polk and several other high ranking Confederate officers found a good vantage point on Pine Mountain to observe Union forces. General Sherman noticed the group of Confederates through field glass. He ordered nearby Union artillery to fire on them. A battery from the First Ohio Light Artillery fired at the Confederate officers. One shell landed close by, startling the Confederates, who then began to disperse. A second shell struck Polk directly, passing through his chest from side-to-side, nearly cutting him in half.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P8'>Despite the controversies surrounding Polk as a Confederate general, he was very popular among Confederate troops. His death was widely mourned within the Confederacy. He was initially buried in Saint Paul’s Church in Augusta, Georgia. However, his remains were moved to Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1945.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS84072P0'>Absolom Madden West was a Confederate general, a Mississippi politician, railroad executive, and vice presidential candidate. Born in Alabama in 1818, West moved to Mississippi around 1837 to establish a plantation with property he acquired from federal land grants. He entered Mississippi state politics as a Whig and won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1847. He married Caroline O. Glover in the 1840s and the couple had four surviving children, born between 1849 and 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P1'>In 1853, he took an office job with the new Mississippi Central Railroad, gaining experience not only in railroad development but corporate and logistical operations. As a Whig, West originally opposed secession. However, after Mississippi left the Union in 1861, during the secession crisis that split the country following Abraham Lincon’s election to president in November 1860, West offered his loyalty and services to the state. He was promoted a brigadier general in the Mississippi state militia, and helped raised a regiment of volunteers. Recognizing his skill and experience in administrative and logistical work, state officials appointed him to several different managerial roles, such as quartermaster general, paymaster general, and commissary general of the militia. He made recommendations to the state legislature to improve the accounting of funds, and was the only state officer to have his accounting books in order and submitted at the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P2'>West took the role of president over the Mississippi Central Railroad around 1864. He remained in that position until around the end of the war, then returned to state politics—again serving in the Mississippi Senate—after the Illinois Central purchased the Mississippi Central. West was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the early effort by the Mississippi government in 1865 to earn readmission to the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, he was among the Mississippi delegation refused seats in Congress when Republicans in Washington, D.C., objected to Mississippi’s “Black Codes”—a series of highly discriminatory laws passed in the summer of 1865 to restrict the civil rights of African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P3'>West became involved in labor rights during Reconstruction, helping form a branch of the National Labor Union. Reentering the Mississippi Senate in the early 1870s, around 1876 he broke away from the Democratic Party and joined the emerging “Greenback Party”—an independent, anti-monopoly political party. It united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters, namely the expansion of paper currency believed to help farmers and small businesses. Attesting to the party’s ability to bring former enemies together, the party’s national convention in 1884 nominated former Union general Benjamin Butler (who had been despised within the Confederacy during his occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War) for its presidential candidate and the former Confederate militia general West as vice president. The party polled only a 1.7% of the popular vote in 1884.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
