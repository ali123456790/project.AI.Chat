                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52212P0'>James Zachariah George was a Confederate officer and U.S. senator from Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P1'>Born in Monroe County, Georgia, on October 20, 1826, George moved to Mississippi as a child, first to Noxubee County and then to Carroll County. He volunteered for military service in 1846 for the Mexican-American War and served under the command of Colonel Jefferson Davis, who later was elected president of the Confederate States of America. George saw combat at the Battle of Monterey. Following the Mexican-American War, George returned to Mississippi and studied law. He was appointed a reporter of Mississippi’s Supreme Court in 1854 and spent two decades compiling a multi-volume collection of legal cases.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P2'>George was selected to be a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in January 1861. He was a slave owner and supported the state’s separation from the Union, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to president in November 1860. When the Civil War erupted in the spring of 1861, George volunteered for military service. He received a commission as captain over Company C, 20th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, but resigned in October 1862 when offered a commission as brigadier general in the Mississippi State Troops. He remained in the state service for one year before rejoining the Confederate army (reportedly due to frustration with the Mississippi militia’s poor organization and resources), taking the rank of colonel to command the 5th Mississippi Cavalry. George was captured by Union forces during the Civil War, and spent time in a prisoner of war camp.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P3'>After the Civil War, George practiced law in Mississippi and formed a very successful law firm with Wiley P. Harris. He was a vocal defendant of white supremacy during Reconstruction, and reportedly influenced Republican Governer Adelbert Ames to not arm African American militias in Mississippi during tensions over the 1875 election. Democrats used promises like this to weaken resistance to a campaign of violence and intimidation against African American and Republican voters. As a result, Democrats scored a major electoral victory in Mississippi, helping overturn federal Reconstruction policies designed to protect Black civil rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P4'>In 1879, George received an appointment to the Mississippi Supreme Court. However, he did not remain there long, since he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1880. He won reelection in 1886 and 1892. He was a vocal proponent for a Mississippi constitutional convention in 1890 to disenfranchise Black southerners, and successfully argued in its defense in front of the Senate and the Supreme Court. George was popular among conservative white Mississippians, in part because he crafted legal exceptions to Mississippi’s voting laws that protect poor whites while denying suffrage to African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P5'>George died in 1897 in Mississippi City, Mississippi. He had been married to Elizabeth B. Young. The couple had seven children between 1848 and 1862, five of whom survived to adulthood. George is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in North Carrollton, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P0'>As the American Civil War extended into its third year, the Confederate government found itself deeply indebted and unable to provide food, clothing, and other necessities for its army. On March 26, 1863, the Confederate government passed the Impressment Law. Under this law, state boards of impressment, with the assistance of local commissioners, impressed food, fuel, enslaved persons, and other commodities to support the war effort and to pay off its debts. Commissioners met with local farmers to fix prices for their commodities, subject to revision every two months. One month later, the Confederate government enacted a tax-in-kind. The tax-in-kind required farmers to donate ten percent (to be judged by a collector) of their produce in lieu of taxes paid in currency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P1'>Both of these policies increased tensions between white southerners and the Confederate government. Farmers and their families often felt cheated by government agents offering far less than market value for their goods. Areas close to fighting also disproportionately experienced impressment, as Confederate armies on the ground often stripped their farms clean. The Confederacy also impressed enslaved persons to perform labor, and the brutality of that labor often resulted in the death, injury, or mistreatment of the enslaved, who, if returned at all, did so in much worse condition than they left. The Confederate government also routinely failed to pay for impressed goods and kept enslaved persons longer than their agreed impressment period. Impressment, then, led to protests among rural white southerners, some of whom hoarded their goods from collectors or impersonated collectors in order to acquire food for themselves and their families. The tax-in-kind alone garnered roughly $62 million for the Confederacy from 1863 to 1865, yet combined with impressment, these policies alienated much of the Confederacy's local support and failed to fully pay its debts or win the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests. (Tracy L. Barnett, “Mississippi ‘Milish’: Militiamen in the Civil War,” <hi rend='italic'>Civil War History</hi>, Vol. 66, No. 4 (Dec 2020), 343-379; Michael B. Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)
