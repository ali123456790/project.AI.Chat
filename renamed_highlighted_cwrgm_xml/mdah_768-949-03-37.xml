                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32004263P0'>Stephen Dill Lee was a Confederate general and president of Mississippi State University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P1'>Born on September 22, 1833, in Charleston, South Carolina, Lee was raised and educated in the south until he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1850 and graduated in 1854. He served in the United States Army for the rest of the 1850s, with assignments in Florida, Kansas, and Dakota Territory. Lee served as a quartermaster (supply officer) during most of his assignments. When southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Lee resigned his commission and joined the Confederate cause. His first appointment, in March 1861, was as assistant adjutant general and assistant inspector general for southern forces at Charleston, South Carolina. In April 1861, he was appointed an aid to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, commander of Confederate forces at Charleston. Lee delivered Beauregard’s message to Major Robert Anderson, commander of federal troops at Fort Sumter, demanding his surrender. The subsequent Confederate bombardment and capture of the fort sparked the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P2'>Lee remained in South Carolina for most of 1861. He then received command of an artillery battery in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1862 and appointed an artillery officer in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed admirably during battles near Richmond, Virginia, in the spring of 1862. Lee was promoted and, despite a brief stint as commander of a Virginia cavalry regiment, continued to be one of the Confederacy’s best artillery officers. He fought at the Battle of Second Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, in August 1862, and played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Antietam, when his cannons engaged in heavy combat near the Dunker Church.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P3'>Following Antietam, Confederate officials promoted Lee to brigadier general and sent him to Mississippi to command of an infantry division. In late December 1862, Lee’s division held off an attack by Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman at Chickasaw Bayou, Mississippi. He took command of a Confederate brigade in January 1863, but was again called to artillery service in May 1863, when he was placed in charge of the Confederate artillery defending Vicksburg, Mississippi. His performance at the Battle of Champion Hill garnered praise, but Lee and the rest of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton’s Confederate soldiers were soon surrounded by Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army at Vicksburg and captured.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P4'>Lee was paroled by Union troops and was not allowed to return to service until formally exchanged by federal and Confederate officials. While on parole, he was promoted to major general. Released from parole in October 1863, Lee took command of cavalry troops within the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana. In May 1864, Lee was placed in overall command of the department. Confederates within his command, led by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, were victorious at the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads on June 10, 1864, but suffered a defeat at Tupelo the following month, this time with Lee on the field.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P5'>On June 23, 1864, Lee was promoted to lieutenant general. He was 30 years old, making him the youngest lieutenant general in the Confederate army. On July 26, 1864, he was given command of a corps in General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, then battling William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army near Atlanta, Georgia. He fought in numerous battles in the Atlanta area, and then during Hood’s campaign into Tennessee, sustaining wounds at least two different times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P6'>After recovering from a wound he suffered in December 1864 near Nashville, Lee was assigned to General Joseph E. Johnston’s army in the Carolinas. He fought during the final campaign in North Carolina, surrendering in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P7'>After the war, Lee moved to Columbus, Mississippi, with his wife Regina Harrison, whom he had married in February 1865 while recovering from his wound. The couple settled on a large plantation given to them by Regina’s father and had one child. Lee struggled to make the plantation financially successful. He turned to the study of agriculture, and became a strong proponent of education. Lee briefly served in the Mississippi State Senate in the late 1870s and then helped found the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (present-day Mississippi State University). In 1880 became the school’s first president, remaining in that role until 1899. Lee kept an interest in state politics, serving as a delegate in Mississippi’s Constitutional Convention in 1890, which disenfranchised thousands of Black voters and more firmly entrenched white supremacy in Mississippi society.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P8'>Lee was active in promoting the preservation of Civil War history, serving as president of the Mississippi Historical Society and president of the Vicksburg National Military Park Association. He helped organize veteran reunions, and wrote several articles about the Civil War. In 1908, he fell sick after giving a speech in Vicksburg to visiting Union veterans. He passed away on May 28, 1908. Lee is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51698P0'>Thomas Jesse Wharton was attorney general of Mississippi during the Civil War and a circuit judge after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P1'>Born on May 18, 1817, in Nashville, Tennessee, Wharton was a good student and graduated from Nashville law school at the age of 19. He moved to Clinton, Mississippi, in 1836 to practice law, but returned to Tennessee the following year, where he married Mary Edgar. The couple had nine children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P2'>Around 1839 Wharton and his wife moved to Raymond, Mississippi. In 1856, he was appointed the state’s attorney general and his family moved to Jackson. He remained in that position for eight years, including during most of the Civil War. During the secession crisis of 1861, Wharton also served as a commissioner to Tennessee, tasked with encouraging his native state to secede and join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51698P3'>After the Civil War, Wharton returned to law practice. In 1882, after Reconstruction, he was selected judge of the Seventh Judicial District. He held that position until 1886. Wharton died on January 28, 1900. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P0'>When the American Civil War began in the spring of 1861, many northerners and southerners expected the conflict to be short, settled after a rapid military campaign and perhaps one great battle. When those expectations proved incorrect, Union military authorities began conducting broad offensive operations designed to capture key locations within the Confederacy. The first targets held military or political value, such as fortifications, port cities, and capitals. Union armies advancing toward those objectives began capturing pro-secessionist communities. Because federal activities in the South focused on military objectives, Union armies initially had little guidance on how to govern the Confederate areas they occupied. As a result, federal officers relied upon their own interpretation of law and their military authority. Many took a conservative approach, enacting few changes to the local community, while others governed with a heavy hand—either as punishment to secessionists or to enact their favored political policies. One such example included General John C. Frémont’s declaration of martial law and emancipation of slaves in Missouri. The order was quickly overturned by President Abraham Lincoln’s administration, but the incident revealed the varied actions that occurred in pro-secessionist areas occupied by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P1'>As the war progressed, Union armies advanced deeper into the Confederacy. Lincoln began developing plans for reconstruction and reconciliation of Union-controlled areas, but restructuring local governments was only part of the effect occupation had on Southern communities. Federal armies needed supplies. Union officers acquisitioned resources within occupied areas—sometimes with payment, other times by confiscation—to feed and support their military forces. In cases where Union troops could not maintain a permanent presence, they burned or otherwise destroyed Southern crops, buildings, and railroads to deny their use by Confederates.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P2'>Union-occupied areas of the South also saw an influx of northern businessmen anxious to capitalize on Southern resources. Since the Union navy blockaded Confederate ports and prevented exports to Europe, many Southerners had surplus supplies and limited market options. Cotton speculators shadowed Union armies—and in some cases colluded with federal military officials—to negotiate with these desperate Southern planters to send their crop north. This illicit business practice became rampant in occupied areas, prompting the War Department to establish rules for business transactions within Union lines. Illegal trade continued. In December 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant issued General Orders No. 11 in response to continued concerns about market speculation in occupied portions of the Confederacy. The order was highly controversial because it unfairly blamed the Jewish population for the problematic business practices and called for the expulsion of all Jewish citizens from his military department. The Lincoln administration immediately rescinded the order, but Grant lived with the negative effects of his discriminatory proclamation for the rest of his life. The event highlighted the tensions of market speculation and illicit trade in Union occupied areas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P3'>The most significant effect Union occupation had on Southern communities was the disruption of slavery. Enslaved African Americans fled to Union armies to escape bondage. Early in the war, Union commanders had no guiding policy for handling runaway slaves. Some returned them to their owners; others, with abolitionist principles, happily facilitated their escape north or protection behind Union lines. However, in May 1861, Union general Benjamin Butler developed a new legal approach to fugitive slaves when a small number sought refuge within his lines at Union-occupied Fort Monroe, Virginia. He refused to return them to their secessionist owner, declaring them “contraband of war”—property which could be confiscated according to laws of war. News of this policy saw widespread support across the North, as punishment to secessionists but also as a practical way to deny the Confederacy its chief source of labor. The United States Congress soon followed Butler’s actions with legislation authorizing Union armies to confiscate Confederate property and slaves. As the war continued, federal policies against slavery expanded, until Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared all slaves within Confederate areas forever free. Even with Lincoln’s hope for a quick restoration and reconciliation of the Union, occupied areas of the South were forever changed during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P4'>At the end of the war, the United States Army occupied the whole South. However, sustained occupation was not possible, especially as the War Department reduced the army by discharging hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers. The army kept troops in the south to enforce federal law—especially to protect African American rights—as former Confederates began to move back into local political offices. However, their role in Southern communities declined until 1877, when southern Democrats and Republican supporters of presidential candidate Rutherford Hayes agreed upon a plan to withdraw the last United States soldiers from the South and end Reconstruction. Federal occupation of the South, which had begun in 1861 in response to secession and the Civil War, was over. (Wikipedia; National Park Service; Army Heritage Center Foundation)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

<p corresp='TTP32417989P3' xml:id='OTP32417989P3'>In looking through the <rs ref='#S55222'>Audi-tors</rs> office this morning for a book he requested me to send to him, I found the enclosed bond in a mess of papers left by the <rs ref='#S71916'>Yankees</rs>, when they <rs ref='#S25025264'>occupied</rs> it last summer. They had [indently?] been abstracted from the Enemy office. Deeming this of value, Lenders then to you.

<p corresp='TTP32417989P4' xml:id='OTP32417989P4'>The town has been full of enemy for the last three days of an advance in this direction from <rs ref='#S51788'>Vicksburg</rs>. The enemy has been largely uniformed at that point. I have no doubt but I do not think it is their purpose to occupy Jackson immediately. They can do so at their leisure, &amp; without much [?]. Just now, I think Genl <rs ref='#S32004263'>Lee</rs> would give them a warm reception
