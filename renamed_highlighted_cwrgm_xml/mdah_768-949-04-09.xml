              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99399P0'>Plantations are farms that typically grow cash crops, and often specialize in a single product, such as cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane. Plantation farming continues in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century, especially for crops like coffee beans, rubber trees, and cocoa. In American history the term plantation is most often associated with estates in the American south. Historical descriptions of plantations generate images of large farming operations. However, even moderately-sized southern farms that planted cash crops were sometimes referred to as plantations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P1'>Southern plantations before the Civil War were strongly tied to the institution of slavery. As profit-driven agricultural operations, plantations required large numbers of laborers. This fed the demand for African slave importation to the British colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and bolstered the defense of slavery among southern planters in the nineteenth century. Plantation crops varied by region within the south, with rice being popular in Georgia and South Carolina along the Atlantic coast, tobacco being an early cash crop in Virginia, and then—after the invention of the cotton gin at the end of the eighteenth century which quickly separated seeds from the cotton fibers—the boom in cotton growing across the Deep South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P2'>By 1860, there were approximately 46,200 plantations across the south. More than 20,000 had twenty to thirty slaves. Only about 2,300, or five percent, had one hundred or more slaves. The enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work. The plantations were their home. The same was not always true for the plantation owners. The very large operations frequently had wealthy absentee owners, who resided in cities or other states, leaving plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers. Slave cabins, or slave quarters, were a ubiquitous part of a plantation. They represented the heart of the laborers’ community on the property, but were usually of basic construction and few amenities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P3'>Following the abolition of slavery after the Civil War, many freed people continued to live on plantations. Sharecropping became a popular arrangement between the landowners and the laborers. The property was often divided into plots with tenants assigned to certain sections. The system involved a contract or arrangement which allowed the laborer, or tenant, to keep a portion of the crop they raised. The system was abused, and developed a negative reputation for the level of poverty many sharecroppers (mostly Black, but some white) experienced on plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Representatives of the Freedmen’s Bureau sought to protect Black sharecroppers by regulating contracts during Reconstruction, but the withdrawal of federal officials after 1876 left many African American tenants more subject to unfair sharecropping contracts on the old plantations.

Once dissolved, soldiers returned to their state capitals to deposit their weapons and other publicly owned property. Units were disbanded for a number of reasons throughout the war, including the end of their service agreement and surrender. Frequently, officers disbanded a unit with diminished strength and reorganized it to form a full strength unit. As the Lieber Code did not recognize un-uniformed guerrilla fighters, it was also common for leaders of guerrilla units, like Confederate Col. John Singleton Mosby, to disband their command rather than formally surrender.

<p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P1'>Following Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in April 1864, the enormous process of demobilizing all Confederate armies began. The terms for disbanding Confederate military units Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant offered Lee were mimicked by other Union commanders. Rather that disbanding the men without any restraints, Grant classified them as paroled prisoners of war, which would legally forbid them for taking up arms against the United States again.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD51118P0'>In April 1862, the Confederate government passed its First Conscription Act which made all white men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to compulsory military service for up to three years. Subsequent acts, passed in September 1862 and February 1864, expanded the individuals liable to conscription and length of service. To oversee conscription activities within the Confederacy, the government established the Bureau of Conscription under the Adjutant and Inspector General’s Department in December 1862. The office operated only east of the Mississippi River (conscription activities west of the river were handled by other officials who reported directly to the commanding general of the Trans-Mississippi Department). The bureau faced opposition from some military commanders, including Brigadier General Gideon J. Pillow who took on military authority over conscription efforts in January 1863 in General Joseph E. Johnston’s military department over Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The dispute between civil and military conscription authorities, both claiming hegemony over conscription duties and acting independently from each other, aggravated many southerners already opposed to the prospect of compulsory military service. Additionally, Pillow’s conscription agents used the threat of conscription as a shaming device to generate volunteer enlistments, further tarnishing public attitudes toward the draft. By the time Pillow’s conscription authorities were removed in December 1863 and the Bureau of Conscription resumed full control over the draft in that region, opposition to conscription had reached new heights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD51118P1'>Beyond drawing men from civilian life into military service, the Bureau of Conscription engaged in arresting deserters and returning them to military service. These activities required a large administrative structure, and by early 1864, more than 2,800 people worked for the bureau. By February 1865, bureau officials reported that the organization had drafted nearly 82,000 men into Confederate service. Additionally, officials claimed to have returned more than 33,000 deserters to service. The accounting report also listed several other matters tracked or managed by the bureau. For instance, 76,000 men had joined the Confederacy without being drafted, more than 66,000 men had been exempted from conscription, and around 20,000 had been detailed for agricultural or specialized work projects.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD51118P2'>The Confederate government abolished the Bureau of Conscription in March 1865. Conscription and enlistment duties for the Confederacy fell onto the shoulders of generals commanding the reserves in the various southern states. (William L. Shaw, “The Confederate Conscription and Exemption Acts,” <hi rend='italic'>The American Journal of Legal History</hi>, 385–389; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32047990P0'>Early in the American Civil War, thousands of enslaved African Americans behind Confederate lines fled to Union Armies and forced military and political leaders to adopt a policy toward them.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32047990P1'>In May 1861, General Benjamin Butler at Fort Monroe, Virginia became the first to formally address the issue when three enslaved persons escaped to the fort and their enslaver demanded they be returned. Butler denied his request on grounds that the fugitive slave law of 1850 no longer applied to states claiming to have left the Union. He then classified these newly freed people as "contraband of war" and assigned them to labor for the military.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32047990P2'>President Lincoln resisted action on behalf of the enslaved for fear of isolating neutral slave states like Kentucky and Missouri, yet Congress adopted Butler's policy by passing two Confiscation Acts in August 1861 and July 1862, the first authorizing Union seizure of Confederate property of military value, including the enslaved, and the second freeing all of the enslaved within Union lines. However, these laws largely codified into law the emancipationist policies already being practiced by both the enslaved and many Union generals.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32047990P3'>The Union Army set up what became known as "contraband camps" in which newly freed people of contraband status lived. Contraband camps often presented squalid living conditions within which formerly enslaved persons performed hard labor for the military, faced hostility from white Union soldiers, and were still considered property. However, contraband camps also offered the promise of legal freedom and "became the first great cultural and political meeting grounds that the war produced" for newly freed African Americans who had never been concentrated in such numbers (Hahn, <hi rend='italic'>A Nation Under Our Feet</hi>, 73).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32047990P4'>The contraband system ultimately highlights the efforts of the enslaved at self-emancipation, as enslaved African Americans' escapes to Union lines early in the war forced the nation to reckon with the question of slavery and the war's aims, and only by freeing themselves did enslaved people reach Union forces and push the nation toward emancipation (Berlin, <hi rend='italic'>The Long Emancipation</hi>, 158-162; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 355; <hi rend='italic'>Wikipedia</hi>).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005147P0'>The official definition of a spy in the American Civil War was "a person who secretly, in disguise or under false pretense, seeks information with the intention of communicating it to the enemy' in wartime." (Essential Civil War Curriculum) Espionage remained an important, though far from central, element of the Civil War. Throughout the war, neither the Union nor the Confederacy possessed centralized agencies for obtaining or managing intelligence. Spies typically gathered intelligence and reported it directly to commanding generals, who then parsed out the reliability of that intelligence for themselves. Neither the Union nor the Confederacy held civil laws for those caught spying and thus turned them universally over to military tribunals, where the punishment for espionage was death by hanging. While the Union and Confederacy both hanged numerous alleged spies, many times spies were treated as prisoners-of-war and exchanged like any other soldiers. The intelligence offered by spies seldom influenced the planning or outcome of battles, though in a few cases it did influence individual leaders' decision making therein.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25005147P1'>The intelligence provided by spies took many forms, including intercepting and decoding documents written in cipher, and scouting troop movements and locations. Spies hired by either government worked for a fee ($2 per day for Union spies) that, given the risk of losing their life if caught, greatly exceeded that of an enlisted soldier ($13 per month in the Union). Spying not only provided a lucrative opportunity for those who did not get caught, it also provided that opportunity to those traditionally outside the mechanisms of power. Women spied for both sides of the war, while many self-emancipated formerly-enslaved African Americans served as the primary informants for the Union. Though haphazard at first, General Joseph Hooker in 1863 established the Bureau of Military Information within the Army of the Potomac, composed of both civilians and soldiers, to spy on the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. While espionage in the American Civil War remained largely amateur throughout the Civil War, it nonetheless set the foundation upon which the U. S. military would build in future conflicts (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
