                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94773P0'>Leonidas Polk was a bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P1'>Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on April 10, 1806, Polk was raised and educated in North Carolina. He spent two years at the University of North Carolina before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While at West Point, Polk joined the Episcopal Church. He graduated from the military academy in July 1827 and received a commission as a U.S. Army artillery officer. Polk resigned from the army in December 1827 and entered the Virginia Theological Seminary. In 1830, shortly before he completed his religious training, he married Frances Ann Devereux. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P2'>In 1831, Pok was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal Church in 1831. The following year Polk and his wife moved to Maury County, Tennessee. He served as a priest in Columbia. During the 1830s, Polk’s personal finances grew, and he became a prominent slaveowner. By 1840, he owned 111 slaves, and by 1850 he reportedly had 400 enslaved people. In 1841, Polk was elected Bishop of Louisiana. His public standing and great wealth made him a prominent public figure outside of the church. He helped establish the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, intended to be a world-class center of higher learning for the southern, slaveholding states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P3'>In 1861, when the southern states seceded from the Union, Polk oversaw the creation of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. He wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis—a West Point classmate—to offer his services and received a commission as major general in the Confederate Army. Placed in charge of Confederate troops between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers, Polk tried to draw the neutral state of Kentucky into the Confederacy. He sent Confederate units into that state. The maneuver was a major strategic blunder, as the Kentucky legislature reacted with hostility and requested support from the Union to repel the Confederate “invaders.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P4'>Polk clashed with other Confederate generals, including his superior officer, General Albert Sidney Johnston, and submitted his letter of resignation to Jefferson Davis in November 1861. Davis rejected the resignation and Polk retained a field command. He led troops in battle against Ulysses S. Grant at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861, scoring a moral victory by repulsing Grant’s attack. However, a few days later, Polk was seriously wounded when a cannon nicknamed “Lady Polk,” in honor of his wife, exploded during a firing demonstration. He spent several weeks convalescing.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P5'>Polk returned to command in early 1862, leading Confederate soldiers at the battles of Shiloh, Perryville, and Murfreesboro. His performance during these engagements proved his bravery (helping him attain the rank of lieutenant general in October 1862), but also revealed weaknesses in handling logistics and strategy. Most significantly, he continued to engage in rivalries with other officers. He lobbied his friend Jefferson Davis to relieve General Braxton Bragg from command in the west; Bragg in return told Davis that Polk was unwilling to follow orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P6'>In the face of the high profile dispute between Bragg and Polk, in late 1863 Davis placed Polk in command of Confederate soldiers in Mississippi. The state was already partially under Union control—Vicksburg having been captured by Grant in July 1863, and the capital city of Jackson having been sacked by William Tecumseh Sherman—and Polk struggled to resist Union periodic federal raids against key Mississippi towns. Then, in May 1864, Polk received orders to join General Joseph E. Johnston in northern Georgia to repel Sherman’s advance to Atlanta. Polk was placed in command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P7'>On June 14, 1864, near Marietta, Georgia, Polk and several other high ranking Confederate officers found a good vantage point on Pine Mountain to observe Union forces. General Sherman noticed the group of Confederates through field glass. He ordered nearby Union artillery to fire on them. A battery from the First Ohio Light Artillery fired at the Confederate officers. One shell landed close by, startling the Confederates, who then began to disperse. A second shell struck Polk directly, passing through his chest from side-to-side, nearly cutting him in half.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P8'>Despite the controversies surrounding Polk as a Confederate general, he was very popular among Confederate troops. His death was widely mourned within the Confederacy. He was initially buried in Saint Paul’s Church in Augusta, Georgia. However, his remains were moved to Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1945.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32048232P0'>Enslaved persons could be contracted out, or "hired out," to other individuals for their labor. The contracting out system grew as enslavement became less profitable in the agricultural pursuits of Upper South states, as it created a way for enslavers to continue profiting from enslaved labor while reinforcing racial hierarchy. Many of those who hired enslaved labor through contracting out did so not only to make money, but also to increase their social standing in a slave society. Those who could not afford to purchase enslaved persons could still reap the social capital conferred by enslaving through temporarily hiring an enslaved person. Contracting of the enslaved occurred most heavily in areas near urban centers like Charleston, South Carolina, with high numbers of artisans who could profit from contract labor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32048232P1'>While many enslaved persons faced danger from spiteful masters and the hardships of being sent away from their families and communities, contracting out offered the enslaved many more opportunities to capitalize on their situation than those limited to their enslavers' properties. Numerous contracted out enslaved persons collected small wages for their contract work, which, though subject to theft from enslavers, some saved to purchase their or their families' freedom. Though enslavers retained the most power, the contracting out system gave the enslaved laborer more negotiating power with both enslavers and hirers, and the enslaved often played the two against each other to better their situations. Contracting out also became a primary vehicle for the enslaved to pass news and information, as contracted enslaved persons would collect news from the often-urban settings in which they worked and then bring that news back to their home communities. Therefore, rumors of Civil War and emancipation often reached enslaved communities through enslaved contract laborers in areas where the Union Army had not reached. While status as a contracted enslaved laborer remained far less desirable than freedom, enslaved African Americans frequently used it to exercise autonomy and to improve the situations of themselves and others (National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P0'>As the American Civil War extended into its third year, the Confederate government found itself deeply indebted and unable to provide food, clothing, and other necessities for its army. On March 26, 1863, the Confederate government passed the Impressment Law. Under this law, state boards of impressment, with the assistance of local commissioners, impressed food, fuel, enslaved persons, and other commodities to support the war effort and to pay off its debts. Commissioners met with local farmers to fix prices for their commodities, subject to revision every two months. One month later, the Confederate government enacted a tax-in-kind. The tax-in-kind required farmers to donate ten percent (to be judged by a collector) of their produce in lieu of taxes paid in currency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P1'>Both of these policies increased tensions between white southerners and the Confederate government. Farmers and their families often felt cheated by government agents offering far less than market value for their goods. Areas close to fighting also disproportionately experienced impressment, as Confederate armies on the ground often stripped their farms clean. The Confederacy also impressed enslaved persons to perform labor, and the brutality of that labor often resulted in the death, injury, or mistreatment of the enslaved, who, if returned at all, did so in much worse condition than they left. The Confederate government also routinely failed to pay for impressed goods and kept enslaved persons longer than their agreed impressment period. Impressment, then, led to protests among rural white southerners, some of whom hoarded their goods from collectors or impersonated collectors in order to acquire food for themselves and their families. The tax-in-kind alone garnered roughly $62 million for the Confederacy from 1863 to 1865, yet combined with impressment, these policies alienated much of the Confederacy's local support and failed to fully pay its debts or win the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004747P0'>The Confederacy extended the practice of hiring enslaved persons, common in urban areas of the Upper South throughout the antebellum period, to its war industries during the American Civil War (1861-1865). Early in the war, private companies involved in war industries like ironworks, as well as some military departments and individual soldiers, hired enslaved laborers in the absence of white employees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004747P1'>However, after the Confederate Impressment Law of March 26, 1863, the Confederate government impressed thousands of enslaved persons to work on its fortifications. Enslaved persons endured awful living and working conditions during their impressments, and the mortality and illness rates among impressed enslaved persons soared. Fearful of an enslaved uprising, Confederate officials restricted the few freedoms previously afforded the enslaved. Impressed enslaved persons also faced increased rates of separation from their wives and children, who were then forced to work harder in their absence.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004747P2'>However, many impressed enslaved persons manipulated the displacement of impressment to their favor, escaping from fortifications and thereby self-emancipating. Impressment also angered many enslaving white Southerners. The Confederate government often failed to pay for or return impressed enslaved persons after their agreed-upon periods of impressment and returned others weakened by sickness and overwork. The Confederacy's widespread impressment of the enslaved thereby created division among Southerners at a pivotal time in the war when battlefield losses had already depleted morale. Regardless, the Confederate government ultimately requested 20,000 enslaved persons in 1864 alone, subject to impressment. (Encyclopedia Virginia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
