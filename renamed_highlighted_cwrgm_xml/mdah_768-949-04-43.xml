                    <p xml:id='OTPS82983P0'>Christopher Haynes "Kit" Mott was a lawyer, Mississippi State Representative, Judge, and Confederate officer. Born on June 22, 1826 in Livingston County, Kentucky, Mott moved to Holly Springs, Marshall County, Mississippi with his family when he was a child. He became a lawyer but also served in the Mexican-American War, ending the conflict with a rank of Colonel. In 1849, Mott became a state Representative for Marshall County. In the 1850s, Mott became a Probate Judge, and in 1858, he received a temporary federal appointment as the U.S. Commissioner to investigate arrearages of debts in relation to Indian Affairs in the Oregon and Washington Territories. By 1860, he had returned to Mississippi, and with the outbreak of the Civil War, he was appointed a Brigadier General commanding the Ninth and Tenth Mississippi Infantries (state militia). By 1862, however, he had resigned his commission and taken a position as Colonel of the Nineteenth Mississippi Infantry, CSA.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS82983P1'>Mott was married to Sally (Govan) Mott (later Billups). The pair did not have any children. Mott died at the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, 1862. He was buried in Virginia, but his remains were moved to Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi after the war.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56354P0'>John McGuirk was a Confederate officer from Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56354P1'>Born on June 24, 1827, McGuirk lived in Holly Springs, Mississippi, and was involved in the state militia on the eve of the Civil War. When the war broke out, McGuirk was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Seventeenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment and saw combat in the Eastern Theater in 1861 and 1862. In June 1863, he took command of a Mississippi militia unit designated the Third Mississippi State Cavalry Regiment, which mustered into Confederate service as the Third Mississippi Cavalry Regiment in 1864. The regiment fought against Union forces campaigning in Mississippi and Tennessee for the rest of the war, eventually retreating through Alabama and then disbanding in Florida.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56354P2'>McGuirk became involved in railroad development after the Civil War. He was also involved in a personal dispute with another former officer, Colonel Harvey W. Walker, which reportedly led to at least two violent interactions and the death of Walker. McGuirk moved to Tennessee after the war and passed away near Memphis on October 16, 1871 at the age of 44. He was married to Louisa Virginia Mahaffey and had at least three children that survived to adulthood. McGuirk is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD68643P0'>Military elections were a common practice within volunteer and militia units of both the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War, a tradition with its roots going back to the Revolutionary War. These elections took place at the company and regimental levels. Company officers were elected by the unit’s soldiers, and in turn, these company officers elected the regiment’s Colonel, Lt. Colonel, and Majors. Officially, Governors had the authority to appoint a Colonel to command a regiment but usually deferred to the officer elected by the regiment's men. Often, these elections put men without military experience or otherwise unqualified to lead their units into battle with disastrous outcomes. Also, junior officers found it difficult to enforce military discipline as they were beholden to the soldiers for their position, which they could be voted out of.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD68643P1'>Union and Confederate authorities sought to limit the detrimental effects of these officer elections. On July 22, 1861, the day after the Union loss at the First Battle of Bull Run, the United States Congress authorized an examination board for officers. Many were deemed unfit and removed, while others resigned. The Confederate Congress established a similar board on October 13, 1862. Military elections continued during the war but to a lesser extent due to government oversight on both sides. They eventually ended in favor of ensuring qualified officers were put in command positions. (James M. McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</hi>; <hi rend='italic'>Public Laws of the Confederate States of America</hi>, 1862 Public Laws, S2, 85-87; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57068P0'>Many southern states viewed Republican Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency in November 1860 as a threat to the institution of slavery and the climax of a series of sectional crises throughout the 1850s. Mississippians had debated the merits of secession as early as 1850, and Lincoln's election renewed calls for secession. A week after Lincoln's election, Governor John J. Pettus encouraged the state's politicians to hold a secession convention. South Carolina's secession in December 1860 provoked further calls for Mississippi to follow. Delegates met in the Mississippi House of Representatives in Jackson, Mississippi on January 7, 1861 to decide the state's future. Only two days into the Convention, on January 9, 1861, delegates voted 83-15 to secede from the United States, making Mississippi the second state to do so. The Convention then passed an ordinance of secession laying out the state's motivations, each of which tied directly to the institution of slavery (National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)
