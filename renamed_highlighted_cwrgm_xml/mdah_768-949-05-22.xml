                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56587P0'>James Alexander Seddon was an American congressman and then Secretary of State of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P1'>Born near Fredericksburg, Virginia, on July 13, 1815, Seddon grew up in Virginia and graduated from the University of Virginia’s law school. After working as an attorney for several years, Seddon entered politics, winning election as a Democrat to the U. S. House of Representatives in 1845. He declined to run for reelection due to a disagreement with the Democratic platform, but returned to Congress in 1849. In 1851, Seddon left public office, citing poor health, and resided in a plantation along the James River, near Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P2'>Seddon became active in politics again in 1861, during the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. He attended a peace conference in Washington, D.C., in February 1861, which brought together representatives from the upper southern states who wished to avoid a war over secession. However, after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina, and President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down secessionist defiance of federal authority, Virginia seceded. Seddon backed the Confederate cause and served in the Confederate Congress as a representative of Virginia. In 1862, he received an appointment by Confederate president Jefferson Davis to serve as Secretary of State for the Confederacy—the fourth man to hold the position, and ultimately being the longest serving.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P3'>Seddon remained secretary until January 1, 1865, then retired and returned to his home. Union soldiers arrested him in May 1865; he spent several months in prison before being released. Seddon remained out of public life following the Civil War, dying on August 19, 1880, at the age of 65. He was married to Sarah Bruce, and had nine children. Seddon is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25011848P0'>William Tecumseh Sherman was a Union general most famous for capturing Atlanta, Georgia, and conducting a military campaign across Georgia, helping bringing an end to the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P1'>Born on February 8, 1820, in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman was the son of a large and prestigious family. However, his father died suddenly in 1829, leading to Sherman and his siblings being sent to live with friends and family. Sherman moved in with Thomas Ewing, who later became a United States senator. Ewing helped Sherman receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1840 and saw service in Florida during the Seminole Wars.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P2'>Sherman was sent to California during the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s and missed the field experience and promotions many of his military colleagues enjoyed during campaigns in Mexico. He married Ellen Boyle Ewing, one Ewing’s daughters, in 1850. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage. He remained in military service in California until 1853, when he resigned and went into banking. He proved moderately successful, but left California in the late 1850s and moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, to work as an office manager in a law firm operated by two of his wife’s brothers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P3'>In 1859, Sherman received an offer to be superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning &amp; Military Academy in Pineville, Louisiana. (The school would later become Louisiana State University.) He proved to be an effective teacher and school administrator, and was popular among students and faculty. However, when the Civil War broke out in 1861, Sherman resigned from the position and traveled north to volunteer for Union military service. He was commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S. Infantry Regiment, and then placed in command of a brigade of volunteers in Virginia. He led the brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The battle was an embarrassing defeat for the Union Army, but Sherman performed well and was promoted to brigadier general. He was sent to Kentucky to assist federal military operations in the west.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P4'>While in Kentucky, Sherman expressed his belief that the conflict would be long and bloody. He received criticism for this unpopular opinion, although he was later proven entirely correct. In late 1861, Sherman began to suffer from depression, contemplating suicide, and resigned from his position in Kentucky. After recuperating for several weeks, he returned to service in December 1861 and was placed in charge of logistical operations in the Department of the Mississippi. In that role he supported Ulysses S. Grant’s successful capture of Fort Donelson, and was so impressed by the victory that he requested to serve under Grant, despite technically having higher seniority in rank. In March 1862, the War Department granted Sherman’s wish and was given command of a division within Grant’s Army of West Tennessee, helping establish one of the most effective partnerships in U.S. military history.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P5'>Only a month later, in April 1862, Sherman’s division was overrun by Confederate troops under Albert Sidney Johnston during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh. Sherman rallied many of his soldiers and, alongside Grant, the next day counterattacked and pushed the southern troops back to win the battle. Sherman was wounded twice at Shiloh, and had three horses shot from under him. Grant was impressed with Sherman’s performance, and the War Department promoted him to major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P6'>Over the next two years, Sherman became one of Grant’s most trusted subordinates, leading part of Grant’s army during the Vicksburg campaign and during engagements around Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1863. In the spring of 1864, when Grant received promotion as overall commander of Union armies, Sherman was placed in command of federal troops in the western theater. Grant relocated to Virginia to lead Union forces against Robert E. Lee’s famed Army of Northern Virginia while Sherman crafted a plan to drive an army into the heart of the Confederacy. In early 1864, he launched a campaign from Chattanooga to capture the major industrial city of Atlanta. Over the course of several weeks, he commanded three Union armies in a coordinated advance against Confederate forces under Joseph E. Johnston. Sherman captured Atlanta in September 1864, strongly boosting northern morale and aiding to Abraham Lincoln’s reelection in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P7'>Following his capture of Atlanta, Sherman embarked on an even bolder campaign. Leaving two of his three armies to watch a Confederate army under John Bell Hood in Tennessee, Sherman personally took command of his third army and ordered it to march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah. The effort involved a great deal of risk, as it saw Sherman’s army cut off from other Union forces, with no base of supply or reinforcements. With 60,000 soldiers, Sherman advanced across Georgia, destroying buildings, burning crops, and generally bringing destruction to southern communities not yet exposed to the realities of war. His army killed relatively few people compared to that seen in other Civil War campaigns, as southern commanders could not field a sufficient force in Georgia to attack the federals in force. However, the psychological effect was monumental, and his capture of Savannah on December 21, 1864, electrified the north and convinced many southerners that the Confederacy was doomed.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P8'>After reaching Savannah, Sherman turned his army northward and marched through South Carolina, the first state to secede. His troops again burned buildings and crops on his way to Columbia. They captured the city on February 17, 1865, and the city burned that night and the next day. While many blamed Sherman’s Union soldiers for destroying South Carolina’s capital out of vengeance, some of the fires may have been caused by Confederate soldiers trying to destroy large stores of cotton before abandoning the city. Sherman then continued northward into North Carolina and defeated Joseph E. Johnston’s army shortly after Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P9'>Despite his reputation for destruction during the war, Sherman held no animosity toward former Confederates. In fact, his initial terms of surrender to Confederate forces in North Carolina were considered too lenient and were overruled by federal officials, who were especially enraged by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln only days earlier.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P10'>After the war, Sherman remained in the army and was promoted to lieutenant general. During the late 1860s, he oversaw U.S. military operations in the west against Native Americans. In 1869, after Grant won election as president of the United States, Sherman was promoted to full general and made Commanding General of the United States Army. He remained in that position until 1883. Three years before he retired, during a speech to a large crowd in Columbus, Ohio, Sherman stated, “There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.” Within months, the line had become immortalized as “War is hell.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P11'>Sherman spent his last years in New York City, attending social events and entertaining guests and notable public figures. Among the people he routinely conversed with was his former enemy, Joseph E. Johnston. The two ex-generals highly respected each other. Sherman was briefly considered as a candidate for president in 1884, but stated that he would refuse to serve in that office even if elected.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P12'>Sherman died on February 14, 1891, at the age of 71. Joseph E. Johnston attended a large funeral for Sherman in New York as an honorary pallbearer, and stood in the cold rain without a hat out of respect. When cautioned that he should cover up to prevent getting sick, Johnston reportedly said, “If I were in [Sherman’s] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat.” Johnston in fact did become sick shortly after Sherman’s funeral and passed away from pneumonia a few weeks later. Sherman's remains were transported to Missouri for final interment. Today he is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027652P0'>William Yerger served as a justice on Mississippi’s Supreme Court and in the Mississippi legislature during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P1'>Born on November 22, 1816, in Lebanon, Tennessee, Yerger attended the University of Nashville, studied law, and became a practicing attorney at the age of 21. He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1837 and established a successful law practice. He belonged to the Whig Party, an association some in Mississippi later said slowed his ascent within the state’s strong Democratic public and political setting. However, in 1850 he was elected to Mississippi’s High Bench of Errors and Appeals (later called the Supreme Court). He served on the Court for three years, before returning to legal practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P2'>During the Civil War, Yerger served in the Mississippi legislature, and was active in the immediate postwar effort to reconstruct the state government under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient policies for readmission to the Union. He established a very strong reputation as an attorney and jurist in Mississippi, so much so that the state’s Supreme Court adjourned for a day in his honor upon receiving word of his death on June 7, 1872, at the age of 55. Yerger had been married to Malvina Hogan Rucks and had five children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery at Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32123699P0'>Gas lighting companies provided fuel gas to residential and commercial consumers for indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures in the nineteenth century. Types of fuel included, but were not limited to, methane, propane, hydrogen, and natural gas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123699P1'>Gas had emerged as a viable source for lighting in eighteenth century Europe, as inventors experimented with natural gas and fumes extracted from coal, peat, and wood to fuel lanterns. Engineers successfully used gas for light fixtures at the Soho Foundry in Cornwall, England, around 1800. This sparked a surge of factories in England incorporating gas lighting to extend production hours and by 1812 businesses in America began using the technology. In 1816 an artisan in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the first American to use gas lighting in his home and the following year, 1817, Baltimore, Maryland, created the first gas street light in the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123699P2'>Over the next few decades, gas lighting companies opened across the United States to provide fuel for the growing number of homes, businesses, and public facilities using gas-lit fixtures. Engineers continued to refine gas lighting technology, leading to two main sources of fuel—coal gas and oil gas. These efforts improved the quality of the fuel, leading to brighter illumination, and lower costs. Gas lighting was significantly cheaper than oil lamps or candles, helping its commercial success. (Natural gas did not surpass oil gas and coal gas in popularity for lighting purposes until around the twentieth century.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123699P3'>By the late nineteenth century, most American cities used gas lighting for street lamps, railway stations, and other public facilities. Gas companies remained a vital and ubiquitous feature of American in communities, helping sustain the country’s dependence upon fuel for life and work. Although experiments in electrical power by inventors such as Thomas Edison sparked interest in new forms of power, gas continued to provide the most economical method of lighting until the early twentieth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P0'>By 1862 the initial waves of men who enlisted into Confederate military service diminished as enthusiasm for the war diminished, and both the Union and Confederacy enacted drafts to fill their armies. Nearly one year before the Union (March 1863), the Confederacy instituted a national draft in April 1862. There were important social implications to this policy, especially within the exemptions the Union and Confederacy provided. Similar to the Union, the Confederate act allowed drafted men to hire substitutes to serve in their place (often lower-class men willing to serve for much-needed income) and excused men from military service for medical reasons, "workers deemed necessary to maintain society," including select government employees. And unlike the Union, beginning in October 1862, men who enslaved a minimum of twenty (later fifteen) people were exempt.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P1'>The Twenty-Slave Law exemption was a reaction to President Abraham Lincoln's recent announcement of the<lb/>
Emancipation Proclamation. While many southern whites worried about enslaved people uprising with so many white men away at war, these policies cultivated a feeling among impoverished people that they were doing the majority of fighting and suffering for a “rich man's war.” Scholars like Joseph Glathaar proved this was not the case in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia where the wealthy were overrepresented compared with impoverished soldiers, but it is unclear if this was the case in areas like Mississippi, and the perception of unfair protections for the wealthy fueled resentment.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.
