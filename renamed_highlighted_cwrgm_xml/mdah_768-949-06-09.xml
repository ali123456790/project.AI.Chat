                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56823P0'>Thomas Hill Watts, Sr., was the governor of Alabama during the second half of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P1'>Born on January 3, 1819, near Pine Flat, Alabama, Watts graduated from the University of Virginia, studied law, and became a practice attorney in Greenville, Alabama, by 1841. He relocated to Montgomery in 1848, where his law firm thrived. Aside from his legal practice, Watts received a large amount of money as a planter, owning a large amount of land and more than 175 slaves.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P2'>Watts was a Unionist during the growing sectional conflict over slavery in the 1850s. However, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the president in November 1860, Watts joined the call for secession. He served as a delegate at the Alabama secession convention, and was among the officials who signed the ordinance of secession in January 1861. Following an unsuccessful bid for governor of Alabama in 1861, Watts raised the Seventeenth Alabama Infantry Regiment and briefly commanded it as colonel. However, he resigned in 1862 when offered the position as attorney general of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. In that role, Watts helped create the Confederate Supreme Court and defended the Confederacy’s Conscription Act of 1862 which was the first draft law in North America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P3'>In 1863, Watts resigned from the attorney general’s position to run for governor of Alabama again. He won against the incumbent, John Gill Shorter, in part due to his more nationalistic views of the Confederacy, which proved popular among many Alabama citizens who were frustrated with Shorter’s handling of state matters. He battled currency inflation issues and faced an anti-war movement in the Alabama legislature in 1864. Overall, his term in office was filled with internal strife as Union forces campaigned across the south and Confederate armies disintegrated from casualties, defeats, and desertions. He was arrested by Union officials on May 1, 1865, and spent a few weeks in prison before being paroled.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P4'>Union forces had destroyed much of Watts’ plantation and liberated his slaves during the war. He sold a great deal of his plantation to pay debts, and returned to practicing law in Montgomery. He remained active in Democratic politics and worked against Republican Reconstruction, although he did not hold major political office again.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P5'>Watts died on September 16, 1892. He was married twice, first to Eliza Brown Allen, who passed away in 1873. He then married Eleanor Clark Noyes in 1875. Watts had a total of eleven children. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Montgomery, Alabama.

<p corresp='TTP32548818P5' xml:id='OTP32548818P5'>By reference to the repost you will see that the prisoners were Not employed in work, [permissably?] for the reason that there was Not work enough for our own prisoners to do. As they earned nothing and had to be clothed and fed, the Warden thought it proper, to charge the State with just what they cost the State of Alabama, The account is I believe made out up to the first inst, and amount to $10,281.
