                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027652P0'>William Yerger served as a justice on Mississippi’s Supreme Court and in the Mississippi legislature during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P1'>Born on November 22, 1816, in Lebanon, Tennessee, Yerger attended the University of Nashville, studied law, and became a practicing attorney at the age of 21. He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1837 and established a successful law practice. He belonged to the Whig Party, an association some in Mississippi later said slowed his ascent within the state’s strong Democratic public and political setting. However, in 1850 he was elected to Mississippi’s High Bench of Errors and Appeals (later called the Supreme Court). He served on the Court for three years, before returning to legal practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P2'>During the Civil War, Yerger served in the Mississippi legislature, and was active in the immediate postwar effort to reconstruct the state government under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient policies for readmission to the Union. He established a very strong reputation as an attorney and jurist in Mississippi, so much so that the state’s Supreme Court adjourned for a day in his honor upon receiving word of his death on June 7, 1872, at the age of 55. Yerger had been married to Malvina Hogan Rucks and had five children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery at Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the first military drafts occurred during the American Civil War, in which both the Union and Confederate governments issued conscription laws.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P1'>The Confederacy, receiving fewer enlistments than it expected at the beginning of the war, passed the First Conscription Act in April 1862, rendering all able-bodied white males between the ages of 18 and 35 eligible to be compelled into military service, but it included a provision by which a draftee could hire a substitute or obtain an exemption. Fearing insurrections by the enslaved population, the Confederacy passed a Second Conscription Act in September 1862 exempting one white enslaver for every twenty enslaved persons on a property, also known as the "Twenty Slave Law". Both the substitute and twenty slave laws isolated impoverished white southerners and rendered the draft deeply unpopular among non-elite southerners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P2'>In the North, conscription began in July 1862 when Congress authorized the president to enlist any militia company into the United States' service. Conscription extended to the general public in March 1863 with the Enrollment Act, rendering any able-bodied white male citizen or immigrant between the ages of 20 and 45 subject to the draft. This law similarly included a provision allowing one to purchase a substitute or commutation for the then-sizeable fee of $300. Draftees could also be exempt by proving that they were the sole support of family members or other dependents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25004889P3'>Many individuals in the North and South saw their respective drafts as affronts to the freedom and individual liberties upon which the United States was founded, while tensions also arose between those of different races, ethnicities, religions, and social classes that were differently represented in the draft. The draft also brought home the realities of war to many families, North and South, who relied on men to support them, as fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers were sent to fight, where they would make the little money paid to soldiers and possibly lose their lives. Conscription in the American Civil War led to the violence of the New York Draft Riots of July 1863, and resulted in widespread and varied resistance in North and South (Bill of Rights Institute).
