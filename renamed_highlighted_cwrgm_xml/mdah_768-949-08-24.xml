                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63300P0'>William Wirt Adams was a Mississippi state legislator and general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P1'>Born on March 22, 1819, in Frankfort, Kentucky, Adams moved as a child with his family to Natchez, Mississippi. He graduated from Bardstown College in Kentucky in 1839 and shortly afterwards traveled to the Republic of Texas. He volunteered for military service in Texas, participating in campaigns against Native Americans. Adams later returned to Mississippi, married Sarah Huger Mayarant in 1850, and became a successful businessman in Jackson and Vicksburg. The couple had five children over the next few years, and in 1858, Adams won a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives, serving two terms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P2'>When Mississippi seceded from the Union in January 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Adams received an appointment as state commissioner to Louisiana to help facilitate that state’s separation from the Union. In February 1861, Adams received an invitation from the Confederate States of America’s president, Jefferson Davis, to serve as Confederate Postmaster General, but he turned the offer down. Instead, Adams raised a cavalry regiment in Mississippi. Accepted into Confederate service in August 1861, Adams led his regiment in several engagements over the next several months, including Shiloh and Corinth. During Ulysses S. Grant’s campaign to capture Vicksburg, Adams’ regiment conducted patrols, scouted Union activities, and guarded key locations in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P3'>Adams received a promotion to brigadier general in September 1863. He commanded Confederate troops during engagements at Port Hudson and Baton Rouge, and unsuccessfully tried to stop William Tecumseh Sherman’s campaign to Meridian, Mississippi, in February 1864. Adams did score a moral victory when he and his men captured a Union gunboat, USS <hi rend='italic'>Petrel</hi>, on the Yazoo River. The Confederate soldiers carried away eight naval guns and then burned the ship. During the latter part of the war, Adams served alongside famed Confederate cavalry commander Nathan Bedford Forrest in Alabama, before surrendering to Union troops in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P4'>Following the Civil War, Adams returned to Mississippi. He variously stayed in Vicksburg and Jackson. In 1880 he received an appointment as a state revenue agent; five years later he accepted an appointment as postmaster in Jackson by President Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P5'>During the late 1880s, Adams became embroiled in a personal dispute with John H. Martin, the editor of the <hi rend='italic'>New Mississippian</hi>. On May 1, 1888, the two men encountered each other on a street in Jackson. The two men began arguing and then each pulled pistols and fired. Both men died at the scene. Adams is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <value>From the Mississippi Department of Archives and History Governor Clark Collection. Letter from Sheriff William Taylor of Madison County, Mississippi, at Canton, Mississippi, to Mississippi Governor Charles Clark at Macon, Mississippi, requesting assistance to have a still destroyed. Taylor alleges that B. F. Passmore and R. C. Sanders are illegally making whiskey which they have an enslaved person sell to other African Americans. Taylor suggests that Clark ask Confederate General Wirt Adams to have the still destroyed. On the reverse, a note from Clark dated July 7, 1864, directs Adams to destroy said still. A subsequent note from Captain Allen T. Bowie, Jr., dated July 21, 1864, indicates that a detail will be sent to comply with Clark&#39;s order.</value>
