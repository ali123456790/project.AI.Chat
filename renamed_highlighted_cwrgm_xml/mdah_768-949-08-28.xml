                    <p xml:id='OTPS32013822P0'>Benjamin Henry Grierson was a Union cavalry officer during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P1'>Born on July 8, 1826, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, Grierson first pursued a career in music. By 1851 he was a music teacher and band leader in Illinois. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Union military service. He initially served on the staff of Major General Benjamin M. Prentiss, and in late 1861 was promoted to major and assigned to the Sixth Illinois Cavalry. He rose in the ranks to colonel and placed in command of the regiment in April 1862. Grierson proved to be a very capable cavalry officer, leading his troops through several engagements in Tennessee and Mississippi that year. He received command of the Army of the Tennessee’s cavalry division in November 1862, responsible for protecting Ulysses S. Grant’s supply line during the Union campaign into Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P2'>Grierson became famous for leading bold cavalry raids deep into Confederate territory. In the spring of 1863, he led 1,700 Union cavalry troops in a 17-day, 800-mile long raid from La Grange, Tennessee, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, destroying Confederate supplies, rail lines, and capturing several Confederate soldiers. The physical damage from the raid was less significant than the psychological effect it had on Confederate citizens, by demonstrating the Union forces had the capabilities and determination to attack almost anywhere within the Confederacy. Union general William Tecumseh Sherman praised Grierson’s raid, which may have inspired his own “march to the sea” campaign across Georgia a year and a half later. Grierson’s raid through Mississippi in 1863 was also significant in drawing Confederate soldiers away from Grant’s drive toward Vicksburg.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P3'>In the wake of this success, Grierson received a promotion to brigadier general. He supported Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’s operations around Port Hudson and then participated in the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads and the Battle of Tupelo. Shortly before Christmas 1864 Grierson led another bold campaign behind enemy lines, which lasted until January 5, 1865, and resulted in his men overrunning a Confederate encampment at Verona, Mississippi, and capturing more than 500 Confederate soldiers after attacking a train near Egypt Station, Mississippi. Union commanders were so pleased with Grierson’s successes that they promoted him to major general of volunteers shortly afterwards.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P4'>Grierson chose to stay in the U.S. Regular Army after the Civil War ended and the Union army severely downsized. Unlike many other professional officers, he had not attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, or any other military academy. His citizen-soldier background, added to his assignment as colonel over an African American unit—the Tenth U.S. Cavalry Regiment—made him a sort of outcast within the highly competitive army officer ranks. Over the next two decades he served at various posts in Kansas, Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma), Texas, Missouri, New Mexico, and Arizona.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32013822P5'>Grierson retired from the army in 1890 at the age of 64. He died on August 31, 18911, in Michigan. He was married twice, first to Alice Kirk, who passed away in 1888. In 1897 he married Lillian Atwood. Grierson had at least seven children. He is buried in Jacksonville East Cemetery in Jacksonville, Illinois.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS100143P0'>Ellijah A. Peyton was a Confederate officer during the Civil War and a Republican politician in Mississippi during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100143P1'>Born on May 9, 1823, in Tennessee, Peyton moved to Mississippi as a young man. He served in the First Mississippi Regiment, under Jefferson Davis, during the Mexican American War in the 1840s. Following the war, Peyton served as a marshal in Mississippi during the 1850s. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Confederate service and was commissioned as an officer in the Third Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Peyton rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, temporarily taking command of the regiment. He later commanded a Mississippi state cavalry battalion, leading operations in the Mississippi and Tennessee region late in the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS100143P2'>After the Civil War ended, Peyton swore loyalty to the U.S. Constitution and returned to public service. Unlike most other former Confederates, he joined the Republican Party and supported federal Reconstruction efforts. Peyton served in state political office during the Reconstruction era and received an appointment as marshal for Mississippi’s Southern District. He died on February 28, 1906. He is buried in Greenfield Cemetery in Glen Allan, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P0'>As the American Civil War extended into its third year, the Confederate government found itself deeply indebted and unable to provide food, clothing, and other necessities for its army. On March 26, 1863, the Confederate government passed the Impressment Law. Under this law, state boards of impressment, with the assistance of local commissioners, impressed food, fuel, enslaved persons, and other commodities to support the war effort and to pay off its debts. Commissioners met with local farmers to fix prices for their commodities, subject to revision every two months. One month later, the Confederate government enacted a tax-in-kind. The tax-in-kind required farmers to donate ten percent (to be judged by a collector) of their produce in lieu of taxes paid in currency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P1'>Both of these policies increased tensions between white southerners and the Confederate government. Farmers and their families often felt cheated by government agents offering far less than market value for their goods. Areas close to fighting also disproportionately experienced impressment, as Confederate armies on the ground often stripped their farms clean. The Confederacy also impressed enslaved persons to perform labor, and the brutality of that labor often resulted in the death, injury, or mistreatment of the enslaved, who, if returned at all, did so in much worse condition than they left. The Confederate government also routinely failed to pay for impressed goods and kept enslaved persons longer than their agreed impressment period. Impressment, then, led to protests among rural white southerners, some of whom hoarded their goods from collectors or impersonated collectors in order to acquire food for themselves and their families. The tax-in-kind alone garnered roughly $62 million for the Confederacy from 1863 to 1865, yet combined with impressment, these policies alienated much of the Confederacy's local support and failed to fully pay its debts or win the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD68643P0'>Military elections were a common practice within volunteer and militia units of both the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War, a tradition with its roots going back to the Revolutionary War. These elections took place at the company and regimental levels. Company officers were elected by the unit’s soldiers, and in turn, these company officers elected the regiment’s Colonel, Lt. Colonel, and Majors. Officially, Governors had the authority to appoint a Colonel to command a regiment but usually deferred to the officer elected by the regiment's men. Often, these elections put men without military experience or otherwise unqualified to lead their units into battle with disastrous outcomes. Also, junior officers found it difficult to enforce military discipline as they were beholden to the soldiers for their position, which they could be voted out of.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD68643P1'>Union and Confederate authorities sought to limit the detrimental effects of these officer elections. On July 22, 1861, the day after the Union loss at the First Battle of Bull Run, the United States Congress authorized an examination board for officers. Many were deemed unfit and removed, while others resigned. The Confederate Congress established a similar board on October 13, 1862. Military elections continued during the war but to a lesser extent due to government oversight on both sides. They eventually ended in favor of ensuring qualified officers were put in command positions. (James M. McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</hi>; <hi rend='italic'>Public Laws of the Confederate States of America</hi>, 1862 Public Laws, S2, 85-87; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102538P0'>The terms “leave” and “furlough” during the Civil War meant permission for soldiers to be absent from duty. Soldiers on leave were allowed to depart camp and partake in recreational activities or, more often, travel home to visit family. Time off was a privilege for soldiers, and often more available for officers than enlisted men. Soldiers could request leave to handle matters at home in times of hardship or emergency, but permission depended upon the military situation and the commander’s discretion. Furloughs were for limited periods of time—usually no longer than thirty days—and soldiers would be reprimanded for being absent longer than their authorized leave, a violation known as “absent without leave,” or AWOL. Punishments for the crime included loss of pay, additional duties, or temporary imprisonment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P1'>The lack of furloughs contributed to low morale, especially early in the war. Some soldiers deserted or accepted the punishment for being AWOL when denied leave, especially after receiving news of hardships at home. In response, Union and Confederate officials provided more furloughs to soldiers during the latter half of the Civil War. Military officers occasionally granted leave as an award for good behavior, or issued furloughs through a lottery to raise spirits. Commanders used these options sparingly, typically allowing no more than five percent of a unit to be on leave, to maintain the unit’s effectiveness and to reduce jealousy or homesickness among those who remained behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD102538P2'>Some soldiers abused the furlough system to avoid military duties. In rare cases, men conspired with unprincipled officers to generate furloughs without authority from higher command. Other soldiers tried to buy furloughs from their comrades who had received them legitimately, offering as much as two months of pay. The more common practice was having family members write letters to an officer, appealing for the soldier to be granted leave. Once home, some soldiers sought ways to extend their leave. A favorite method involved having a doctor send a note to the soldier’s unit attesting to a medical ailment. Others blamed weather, problems with travel, or other acts of nature. The greatest violation of the furlough system involved soldiers failing to return. Officers had to determine, usually after waiting an extended period of time, whether a soldier was AWOL or had deserted. This issue plagued the Confederacy during the final year of the war, as many soldiers lost faith in victory and chose to go home with a furlough or without.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024545P0'>Draft resistance became especially prominent in the United States during the American Civil War. Both the Confederate and Union governments implemented conscription policies at different points during the conflict and included provisions deeply unpopular to non-elite Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024545P1'>The First Conscription Act, passed by the Confederate Congress in April 1862, allowed draftees to pay for a substitute, while the Second Conscription Act, passed in September 1862, exempted enslavers who owned more than twenty enslaved persons (the so-called "Twenty Slave Law"). This second act intended to prevent slave insurrections; yet in practice it isolated rural, non-elite farmers who could not afford to pay for a substitute and were not wealthy enough to own twenty enslaved persons. (National Battlefield Trust).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024545P2'>In the North, Congress passed the Enrollment Act in March 1863 to conscript citizens into the military. This act, following closely on the heels of the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863, outraged many northerners, particularly white immigrants, who viewed African Americans as economic and social competitors and refused to fight for the freedom of the enslaved. Like the Confederacy, the Union Army draft provided that draftees could purchase a substitute or commutation, but in the North, the bulk of those serving as substitutes were white men of lower socioeconomic class or immigrants. These policies produced tension among the large working class and immigrant populations of the North, leading to extreme violence, including the murder of African Americans and widespread arson in New York City in July 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024545P3'>Up to 20 percent of draftees took measures to avoid enrolling in military service, including fleeing to the West or hiding from local provost marshals (Bill of Rights Institute). Conscription undermined nationalism and deeply affected citizens on the home front, and those individuals and their families who, based on either government's policies, viewed the prolonged Civil War as "a rich man's war but a poor man's fight" often resisted fighting for either cause.

This man Davis has been lying in the woods since the passage of the law declaring all men between the ages of 35 and 40 liable to Confederate services—And this man Davis told me this morning that the Sheriff told him to stay in the Woods until he could get the order from you to appoint Deputy. Sheriffs—he done go—and his appointment was made while he was in the woods—His having lost the furlough that Capt Maxey had given him—And during the time Capt Cooper was stationed at Westville—this man Davis was brought into Capt Coopers—Quarters by some of his friends—and their accord a protection pass for second day. pledg-ing his honor—and his friends also vouching for him to report again at the exparation of his pass—soon commits himself with some Confederate Organizations.
