                    <p xml:id='OTPS48994P0'>Gideon Johnson Pillow was a general in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War and later served as a general for the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P1'>Born June 8, 1806, in Williamson County, Tennessee, Pillow grew up in Tennessee and graduated from the University of Nashville in 1827. He entered the legal profession in Columbia, Tennessee, becoming partners with future-president James K. Polk. In the early 1830s, Pillow’s public standing increased as he received an appointment as a district attorney general in Tennessee and received a commission as a brigadier general in the Tennessee Militia. His future was further boosted by the election of his friend James K. Polk as U.S. president in 1844.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P2'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Polk appointed Pillow a brigadier general. He led troops in several battles, and was wounded at both Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. Pillow was promoted to major general in 1847, but soon ran into conflict with Major General Winfield Scott when the latter accused Pillow exaggerating his role at various engagements—a charge supported by the fact that Pillow likely wrote an anonymous letter to a New Orleans newspaper crediting himself with the American battle victories at Contreras and Churubusco. When Scott arrested Pillow for insubordination and violating military regulations, Pillow wrote to President Polk with accusations that Scott had tried to bribe Mexican leader Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to end the war. In response, Polk relieved Scott of command of U.S. forces in Mexico in February 1848. The matter was eventually settled with Pillow’s charges dropped and Scott reinstated as general-in-chief of the army, but critics of Pillow—including Scott—argued that he was self-serving and willing to lie for personal gain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P3'>Pillow returned to Tennessee after the Mexican-American War and became involved in politics during the 1850s. He attended the 1850 Nashville Convention, which was a meeting among southern leaders to discuss possible responses if the federal government prohibited slavery in territories won from Mexico in the recent war. Some delegates proposed secession, but Pillow and a majority of the other attendees opposed disunion and supported a compromise with the north. Pillow was active in Democratic politics, unsuccessfully vying to be a vice presidential candidate in 1852 and 1856, as well as a failed bid to secure a seat in the U.S. Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P4'>Pillow supported Tennessee when the state declared itself seceded from the Union at the outbreak of the Civil War. He received a commission as a major general in the state’s militia, and then in July 1861 received an appointment as brigadier general in the Confederate army. In September 1861, under orders from Major General Leonidas Polk, Pillow led Confederate troops into Kentucky as an effort to secure that state for the Confederacy. The move proved to be a monumental blunder, as the Kentucky government and many of its citizens saw the incursion as an assault upon their state’s neutrality, thereby securing Kentucky for the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P5'>Pillow gained some fame in the Confederacy following the Battle of Belmont in December 1861, when his force held off an attack by Ulysses S. Grant. He was then placed in command of Confederate troops at Fort Donelson in February 1862, where he led a successful attack to break out of the fort before Grant’s entire force could surround it. Despite achieving that initial objective, Pillow inexplicably withdrew his soldiers for resupply, allowing Union forces to close the gap. With defeat inevitable, Pillow passed command of the fort to a subordinate and escaped before the Confederates surrendered.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P6'>The events at Fort Donelson marred Pillow’s reputation, and he was briefly suspended from command by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. However, in December 1862, Pillow received another chance at command when he was placed in charge of a brigade within the Army of Tennessee under General Braxton Bragg. During the Battle of Murfreesboro, December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863, Pillow reportedly hid behind a tree while his brigade participated in an assault. Receiving criticism for his performance, Pillow was removed from field command and placed in charge of recruiting and conscription for the Army of Tennessee. During the final months of the war he served as Commissary General of Prisoners, before surrendering to Union forces in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS48994P7'>Pillow, who had been one of the wealthiest landowners in Tennessee in 1860, was bankrupt after the war. He rebuilt some of his wealth with a successful law practice in Memphis with former Tennessee governor Isham G. Harris. He died of yellow fever on October 8, 1878, in Arkansas. Pillow had been married twice, first to Mary Martin (who died in 1869) and then to Mary Eliza Dickson (who was forty years his junior). Pillow had eleven children with his first wife and three with his second wife. Pillow is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56823P0'>Thomas Hill Watts, Sr., was the governor of Alabama during the second half of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P1'>Born on January 3, 1819, near Pine Flat, Alabama, Watts graduated from the University of Virginia, studied law, and became a practice attorney in Greenville, Alabama, by 1841. He relocated to Montgomery in 1848, where his law firm thrived. Aside from his legal practice, Watts received a large amount of money as a planter, owning a large amount of land and more than 175 slaves.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P2'>Watts was a Unionist during the growing sectional conflict over slavery in the 1850s. However, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the president in November 1860, Watts joined the call for secession. He served as a delegate at the Alabama secession convention, and was among the officials who signed the ordinance of secession in January 1861. Following an unsuccessful bid for governor of Alabama in 1861, Watts raised the Seventeenth Alabama Infantry Regiment and briefly commanded it as colonel. However, he resigned in 1862 when offered the position as attorney general of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. In that role, Watts helped create the Confederate Supreme Court and defended the Confederacy’s Conscription Act of 1862 which was the first draft law in North America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P3'>In 1863, Watts resigned from the attorney general’s position to run for governor of Alabama again. He won against the incumbent, John Gill Shorter, in part due to his more nationalistic views of the Confederacy, which proved popular among many Alabama citizens who were frustrated with Shorter’s handling of state matters. He battled currency inflation issues and faced an anti-war movement in the Alabama legislature in 1864. Overall, his term in office was filled with internal strife as Union forces campaigned across the south and Confederate armies disintegrated from casualties, defeats, and desertions. He was arrested by Union officials on May 1, 1865, and spent a few weeks in prison before being paroled.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P4'>Union forces had destroyed much of Watts’ plantation and liberated his slaves during the war. He sold a great deal of his plantation to pay debts, and returned to practicing law in Montgomery. He remained active in Democratic politics and worked against Republican Reconstruction, although he did not hold major political office again.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P5'>Watts died on September 16, 1892. He was married twice, first to Eliza Brown Allen, who passed away in 1873. He then married Eleanor Clark Noyes in 1875. Watts had a total of eleven children. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Montgomery, Alabama.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32005182P0'>Z. A. Phillips was a businessman, entrepreneur, and state official in Mississippi in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32005182P1'>Part owner of the Southern Agricultural Implement Factory, an agricultural machinery company, in Jackson, Mississippi, by 1860, Phillips was commissioned as a salt agent by the state government during the Civil War to acquire large quantities of the mineral for public and private use.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32005182P2'>Shortly after the war, he returned to his business pursuits in Jackson, operating the Pearl River Manufacturing Company with partner Joshua Green. Philips also pursued an appointment as superintendent of the Mississippi penitentiary, acquiring that office by 1870. He mixed his state office with business, instituting Mississippi's convict leasing system and advertising the sale of manufactured goods from the penitentiary. Phillips died in 1873.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD56820P0'>Salt was a vital commodity to nineteenth century Americans for its use in preserving food, especially meat, and for processing animal hides. When the Civil War broke out, Mississippi had no salt mines or salt producing company within its borders. It had relied upon salt imports from Europe or northern states. By the end of 1862, Mississippi citizens were running low on their salt reserves. The state government sent agents to Alabama, Louisiana, and Virginia—known to have their own salt works—to purchase large quantities of the substance. Only the agent sent to Louisiana was successful, returning to Mississippi with twenty tons. This amount only offered a slight reprieve to Mississippians, and the governor continued to pursue reliable options for acquiring or producing salt. The governor tried to work with foreign agents who offered to run the federal blockade in the Gulf of Mexico. The state government ultimately spent $20,000 and fifty bales of cotton for this effort, but received no salt in return. The governor also worked with some local companies in Mississippi and Alabama to produce salt locally. None of these projects provided a reliable source of salt, and some were a complete bust.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD56820P1'>In late 1863, the Mississippi government abandoned efforts to work with contractors for salt and placed $500,000 into a domestic manufacturing project. The plan involved appointing a general agent to select one or two manufacturers of salt, and then overseeing the distribution of the product to each county in the state. The agent and manufacturers were each required to give a $60,000 bond to better secure the state’s interests. This plan, along with rough refining efforts by many Mississippi communities, provided a low level of salt provisions to the state through the rest of the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
