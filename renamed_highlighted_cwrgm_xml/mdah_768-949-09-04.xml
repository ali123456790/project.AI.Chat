                    <p xml:id='OTPS32004263P0'>Stephen Dill Lee was a Confederate general and president of Mississippi State University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P1'>Born on September 22, 1833, in Charleston, South Carolina, Lee was raised and educated in the south until he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1850 and graduated in 1854. He served in the United States Army for the rest of the 1850s, with assignments in Florida, Kansas, and Dakota Territory. Lee served as a quartermaster (supply officer) during most of his assignments. When southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Lee resigned his commission and joined the Confederate cause. His first appointment, in March 1861, was as assistant adjutant general and assistant inspector general for southern forces at Charleston, South Carolina. In April 1861, he was appointed an aid to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, commander of Confederate forces at Charleston. Lee delivered Beauregard’s message to Major Robert Anderson, commander of federal troops at Fort Sumter, demanding his surrender. The subsequent Confederate bombardment and capture of the fort sparked the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P2'>Lee remained in South Carolina for most of 1861. He then received command of an artillery battery in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1862 and appointed an artillery officer in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed admirably during battles near Richmond, Virginia, in the spring of 1862. Lee was promoted and, despite a brief stint as commander of a Virginia cavalry regiment, continued to be one of the Confederacy’s best artillery officers. He fought at the Battle of Second Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, in August 1862, and played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Antietam, when his cannons engaged in heavy combat near the Dunker Church.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P3'>Following Antietam, Confederate officials promoted Lee to brigadier general and sent him to Mississippi to command of an infantry division. In late December 1862, Lee’s division held off an attack by Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman at Chickasaw Bayou, Mississippi. He took command of a Confederate brigade in January 1863, but was again called to artillery service in May 1863, when he was placed in charge of the Confederate artillery defending Vicksburg, Mississippi. His performance at the Battle of Champion Hill garnered praise, but Lee and the rest of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton’s Confederate soldiers were soon surrounded by Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army at Vicksburg and captured.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P4'>Lee was paroled by Union troops and was not allowed to return to service until formally exchanged by federal and Confederate officials. While on parole, he was promoted to major general. Released from parole in October 1863, Lee took command of cavalry troops within the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana. In May 1864, Lee was placed in overall command of the department. Confederates within his command, led by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, were victorious at the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads on June 10, 1864, but suffered a defeat at Tupelo the following month, this time with Lee on the field.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P5'>On June 23, 1864, Lee was promoted to lieutenant general. He was 30 years old, making him the youngest lieutenant general in the Confederate army. On July 26, 1864, he was given command of a corps in General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, then battling William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army near Atlanta, Georgia. He fought in numerous battles in the Atlanta area, and then during Hood’s campaign into Tennessee, sustaining wounds at least two different times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P6'>After recovering from a wound he suffered in December 1864 near Nashville, Lee was assigned to General Joseph E. Johnston’s army in the Carolinas. He fought during the final campaign in North Carolina, surrendering in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P7'>After the war, Lee moved to Columbus, Mississippi, with his wife Regina Harrison, whom he had married in February 1865 while recovering from his wound. The couple settled on a large plantation given to them by Regina’s father and had one child. Lee struggled to make the plantation financially successful. He turned to the study of agriculture, and became a strong proponent of education. Lee briefly served in the Mississippi State Senate in the late 1870s and then helped found the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (present-day Mississippi State University). In 1880 became the school’s first president, remaining in that role until 1899. Lee kept an interest in state politics, serving as a delegate in Mississippi’s Constitutional Convention in 1890, which disenfranchised thousands of Black voters and more firmly entrenched white supremacy in Mississippi society.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P8'>Lee was active in promoting the preservation of Civil War history, serving as president of the Mississippi Historical Society and president of the Vicksburg National Military Park Association. He helped organize veteran reunions, and wrote several articles about the Civil War. In 1908, he fell sick after giving a speech in Vicksburg to visiting Union veterans. He passed away on May 28, 1908. Lee is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD93403P0'>The Union and Confederacy allowed drafted men to supply another man to fight in their place, referred to as a military substitute. As this provision required capital, it led to the popular criticism that the war was a "rich man's war and a poor man's fight."
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93403P1'>Under Confederate conscription (or draft) laws, a draftee could hire another man who was exempt from the draft, often due to their age, trade/profession, or lack of citizenship, to serve in their place. Once arranged, they would pay a fee to the Confederate government and a large sum (typically ranging between $800–$1,500 but sometimes reaching as high as $3,000 specie) to the man serving in their place. While this practice was widespread, historians estimate between 50,000–150,000 men in Confederate service were military substitutes, it was publicly unpopular. In late 1863, the CSA Congress abolished substitution and in January 1864 a second act required that the men who had hired substitutes report for military duty. (Library of Congress; NCpedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93403P2'>The Union passed similar substitute provisions. When the US Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863, they similarly included a provision allowing draftees to permanently escape conscription by hiring a willing substitute to serve in their place. (National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

The friends of Davis attempted to have this matter investigated before Davis was taken from home and as they State had an understanding with A B Watts that he would not be taken off until the following day but was taKen off during the night before.

He never having been enrolled or never having enlisted in any Company. with these facts it appears to me that the conduct in the arrest of Davis is extremely unjust, As to the Charges against Davis of being of bad characteer I presume this is immaterial, but I can Say with confidence that but few men in the County Could establish better character than Davis or have done as much for benevolent purposes—Such as assisting <rs ref='#S25013472'>soldiers families</rs>) as Davis. I should have Stated also that upon Davis arrival in Branden (early yesterday morning.) he attempted to have his case herd here but it was denied him, and he hurried to the cars before he could even have time to consult with those who were dis-posed to See that his rights were respected. If Davis has been brought to <rs ref='#S51740'>Macon</rs> you can <del rend='overstrike'>if</del> gather the additional proof by holding ^him^. if held otherwise you can take such course as you think the justice of the Case admits.
