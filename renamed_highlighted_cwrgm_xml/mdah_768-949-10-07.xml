                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71951P0'>James Ronald Chalmers was a Confederate officer and served as a U.S. Representative for Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P1'>Born in Halifax County, Virginia, on January 11, 1831, Chalmers moved with his family to Mississippi during his youth, settling in Holly Springs. After graduating from South Carolina College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in Holly Springs in 1853. Five years later, he was elected district attorney. He was selected as a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in 1861, and helped pass the ordinance of secession which declared the state separate from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P2'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, Chalmers volunteered for military service. He was first commissioned as a captain the Confederate army and soon received a promotion to colonel of the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. After commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida, Chalmers was promoted again, to brigadier general. He performed well during the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and again during the Battle of Murfreesboro from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. In 1864, he fought in western Tennessee, including the Battle of Fort Pillow, which involved Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest murdering several African American Union prisoners. In 1865, he was placed in charge of all Mississippi cavalry in the Mississippi and western Tennessee region. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P3'>After the Civil War, Chalmers returned to Mississippi and resumed practicing law. He gained fame among white conservatives through his opposition to Republican Reconstruction, and led an armed group of Democrats to Friar’s Point in 1876 to chase away the sheriff and intimidate African Americans in the area. That same year he won a state senate seat. When Mississippi was readmitted to the Union, Chalmers won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1877 to 1880. Although he again won reelection in 1880, his Republican opponent, John R. Lynch, disputed the election results. A Congressional investigation found in favor for Lynch, but not until 1882 after Chalmers had served most of the term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P4'>Around 1882, Chalmers broke with the traditional Democratic Party in Mississippi. He ran for reelection in 1882, but as an Independent Democrat with support from some Republicans and the Greenback Party (which was a third-party political movement that focused on economic matters). A traditional Democrat candidate, Van H. Manning, won the election, but this time Chalmers contested the results. Congress decided in Chalmer’s favor and he reentered Congress in June 1884, but lost reelection later that fall.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P5'>Chalmers returned to practicing law after the 1884 election. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and died on April 29, 1882. He had been married to Rebecca Arthur; the couple had two children. Chalmers is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS54036P0'>Nathan Bedford Forrest was a Confederate cavalry commander and later the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P1'>Born on July 13, 1821, in Bedford County, Tennessee, he became his family’s caretaker at age sixteen when his father died. He pursued numerous types of business as a young man, including gambling, farming, and slave trading. When the Civil War began in 1861, Forrest was one of the wealthiest men in the south, owning more than three thousand acres in Mississippi, as well as plantations in Tennessee and Arkansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P2'>He volunteered for Confederate service in 1861 and soon received command of the Third Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. He had no formal military training—and little formal education—yet, proved a natural leader and military tactician. He scored numerous military victories as a cavalry commander, and showed skill in avoiding capture or defeat by Union troops. In February 1862, when Ulysses S. Grant’s troops besieged Confederate troops at Fort Donelson, Forrest led nearly four thousand southern soldiers in escaping across the Cumberland River before the fort fell to the federal units. During the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi in 1863, Forrest was a brigadier general leading Confederate raids on Grant’s supply lines, causing havoc and frustrating federal efforts to stop his cavalry force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P3'>By 1864, Forrest had been promoted to major general. He continued to see great success in raids behind Union lines and through mounting attacks against smaller contingents of Union soldiers. In April 1864, he led Confederate troops against a federal garrison at Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Forrest’s men overran the fort and, according to many witness accounts, began murdering Black Union soldiers who had surrendered to the Confederates. The event became one of the most famous atrocities of the Civil War, widely publicized and investigated by federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P4'>While much of the Confederacy’s military future grew dim in 1864, as William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army advanced upon Atlanta, and Grant’s Union forces backed Robert E. Lee into a defensive position around Richmond, Virginia, Forrest remained mobile and dangerous, scoring notable victories even when outnumbered, such as the Battle of Brice’s Cross Roads in June 1864 in Mississippi. He was promoted to lieutenant general in February 1865, and remained in the field until April 1865, when he surrendered to Union forces in the wake of the Confederacy’s collapse. By the time the Civil War ended, Forrest had been wounded four times, reportedly had twenty-nine horses shot out from under him, and claimed to have killed or defeated thirty Union soldiers in hand-to-hand combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P5'>Following the war, Forrest lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and pursued a career in railroad development. His ventures ultimately were not successful, and he was nearly bankrupt. He moved onto a large plantation on the Mississippi River that used convicts for labor, in a system similar to slavery. Apart from his financial efforts, Forrest’s early postwar activities involved a prominent role in the Ku Klux Klan. Elected the terror organization’s first Grand Wizard in 1867. He helped recruit former Confederates and white southern men to the group as an effort to resist Reconstruction and Republican policies. However, Forrest became disenchanted with the lack of order and discipline he saw during the Klan’s its rapid expansion. In 1869, he tried to dissolve the Klan and ordered its members to destroy their robes and hoods. By the mid-1870s, Forrest began making public speeches advocating for better protection of Black civil rights. These actions caused rebuke from many of his former Confederate colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P6'>Forrest died of diabetes October 29, 1877. He was married to Mary Ann Montgomery and had two children. Forrest was initially buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Then, in 1904, city officials moved his remains (and those of his wife) to a city park named in his honor. In 2021, his remains were moved again, this time to Columbia, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32172106P0'>Forrest’s Cavalry Corps (Confederate) was a semi-independent unit formed on September 28, 1863 under the command of Brig. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest and served in the Western Theater as part of Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. The Corps was unofficially formed when Gen. Braxton Bragg, commanding the Army of Tennessee, transferred most of Forrest’s Division to Maj. Gen Joseph Wheeler’s Cavalry Corps, prompting Forrest to request a transfer to west Tennessee. Bragg granted this request and Forrest headed west with what remained of Gen. Earl Van Dorn’s cavalry which formed the nucleus of his corps and an artillery battery. After evading Union forces for over two months Forrest retreated to Mississippi in December where, at Holly Springs, he began recruiting and organizing his corps. It was first comprised of two divisions, commanded by Maj. Gen. James R. Chalmers and Brig. Gen. Abraham Buford, but at times operated with as many as four divisions. Forrest’s Corps primarily engaged in raiding Union supply lines in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee and destroying railroads. In November 1864 it joined with the Army of Tennessee, now commanded by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood, to replace Wheeler’s Corps then on detached duty in Georgia. After the Confederate failure in Tennessee, Forrest’s Corps continued operations in Mississippi and in spring 1865 conducted an unsuccessful raid into Alabama. It surrendered to Union forces at Gainesville, Alabama on May 9, 1865.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
