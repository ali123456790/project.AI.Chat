                    <p xml:id='OTPS32022518P0'>Edward Richard Sprigg Canby was Union general during the Civil War who oversaw several military departments in the south during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P1'>Born on November 9, 1817, in Piatt’s Landing, Kentucky, Canby attended Wabash College before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1839 and was commissioned as an officer in the Second U.S. Infantry Regiment. Canby served during the Second Seminole War in Florida and the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848. He was promoted three times for bravery for his actions in Mexico, rising to the rank of brevet (honorary) lieutenant colonel. During the late 1840s and early 1850s, he served in New York and in California, often within the adjutant general’s office, handling administrative duties. During the latter part of the 1850s, Canby had assignments in Utah Territory, including campaigns during the U.S. Army’s engagements with Mormon settlers in the Utah War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P2'>Canby was in New Mexico Territory in 1861, when the Civil War broke out. Placed in command of the Department of New Mexico, his first military campaign was against Confederate forces—commanded by one of his former subordinates, Henry Sibley—for the future of the territory. Despite losing the Battle of Valverde in February 1862, Canby scored a crucial victory at the Battle of Glorieta Pass. He was promoted to brigadier general and transferred to the east where he took command of the defenses of New York City’s harbor. After several months there, Canby received an appointment as an aide to the Secretary of War. In 1864, he was promoted to major general and received a field command, relieving Union general Nathaniel P. Banks in Louisiana. Although wounded by Confederate gunfire while aboard the gunboat USS <hi rend='italic'>Cricket</hi> on a river in Arkansas, Canby remained in active service and successfully led Union troops during operations at Mobile, Alabama, in early 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P3'>Although criticized by some of his colleagues, such as Ulysses S. Grant, for being too cautious as a battlefield commander, Canby was widely recognized as an excellent administrator. He oversaw federal military control of Louisiana at the end of the war, and then saw a series of departmental commands, including over Washington, D.C., Maryland, Texas, and Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P4'>Canby’s final assignment was in the Pacific Northwest in the early 1870s, dealing more with Native Americans than post-Civil War Reconstruction. He labored to resolve a conflict between the U.S. government and the Modoc tribe, which had been relocated from California to Oregon. Choosing diplomacy, since his predecessor’s military efforts had not succeeded, Canby offered to meet with Modoc representatives on April 11, 1873, near the border of California and Oregon. Although warned that the Modoc representatives could be violent and that he should not attend the meeting without a large military guard, Canby was determined to make a sincere peace effort with a limited escort. During the meeting, Modoc representatives asked Canby to allow them to return to their preferred homeland. When he admitted that he could not guarantee their request, two Modoc men attacked Canby, shooting him twice in the head and cutting his throat. The Modocs also killed a peace commissioner that had accompanied Canby. The assassination electrified the American public against the Modocs. The U.S. Army captured the assailants and executed most of them, while the Modoc tribe was sent to reservations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022518P5'>Canby’s body was sent east and buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was married to Louisa Hawkins and had one child who did not survive to adulthood.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS54036P0'>Nathan Bedford Forrest was a Confederate cavalry commander and later the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P1'>Born on July 13, 1821, in Bedford County, Tennessee, he became his family’s caretaker at age sixteen when his father died. He pursued numerous types of business as a young man, including gambling, farming, and slave trading. When the Civil War began in 1861, Forrest was one of the wealthiest men in the south, owning more than three thousand acres in Mississippi, as well as plantations in Tennessee and Arkansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P2'>He volunteered for Confederate service in 1861 and soon received command of the Third Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. He had no formal military training—and little formal education—yet, proved a natural leader and military tactician. He scored numerous military victories as a cavalry commander, and showed skill in avoiding capture or defeat by Union troops. In February 1862, when Ulysses S. Grant’s troops besieged Confederate troops at Fort Donelson, Forrest led nearly four thousand southern soldiers in escaping across the Cumberland River before the fort fell to the federal units. During the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi in 1863, Forrest was a brigadier general leading Confederate raids on Grant’s supply lines, causing havoc and frustrating federal efforts to stop his cavalry force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P3'>By 1864, Forrest had been promoted to major general. He continued to see great success in raids behind Union lines and through mounting attacks against smaller contingents of Union soldiers. In April 1864, he led Confederate troops against a federal garrison at Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Forrest’s men overran the fort and, according to many witness accounts, began murdering Black Union soldiers who had surrendered to the Confederates. The event became one of the most famous atrocities of the Civil War, widely publicized and investigated by federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P4'>While much of the Confederacy’s military future grew dim in 1864, as William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army advanced upon Atlanta, and Grant’s Union forces backed Robert E. Lee into a defensive position around Richmond, Virginia, Forrest remained mobile and dangerous, scoring notable victories even when outnumbered, such as the Battle of Brice’s Cross Roads in June 1864 in Mississippi. He was promoted to lieutenant general in February 1865, and remained in the field until April 1865, when he surrendered to Union forces in the wake of the Confederacy’s collapse. By the time the Civil War ended, Forrest had been wounded four times, reportedly had twenty-nine horses shot out from under him, and claimed to have killed or defeated thirty Union soldiers in hand-to-hand combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P5'>Following the war, Forrest lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and pursued a career in railroad development. His ventures ultimately were not successful, and he was nearly bankrupt. He moved onto a large plantation on the Mississippi River that used convicts for labor, in a system similar to slavery. Apart from his financial efforts, Forrest’s early postwar activities involved a prominent role in the Ku Klux Klan. Elected the terror organization’s first Grand Wizard in 1867. He helped recruit former Confederates and white southern men to the group as an effort to resist Reconstruction and Republican policies. However, Forrest became disenchanted with the lack of order and discipline he saw during the Klan’s its rapid expansion. In 1869, he tried to dissolve the Klan and ordered its members to destroy their robes and hoods. By the mid-1870s, Forrest began making public speeches advocating for better protection of Black civil rights. These actions caused rebuke from many of his former Confederate colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P6'>Forrest died of diabetes October 29, 1877. He was married to Mary Ann Montgomery and had two children. Forrest was initially buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Then, in 1904, city officials moved his remains (and those of his wife) to a city park named in his honor. In 2021, his remains were moved again, this time to Columbia, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32002213P0'>Dabney Herndon Maury was a West Point instructor, military textbook author, and Confederate general. Born on May 21, 1822, in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Maury was raised by his uncle Matthew Fontaine Maury (an oceanography and naval meteorology expert) after his father, a naval officer, died in the West Indies. Maury attended the University of Virginia before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1846 and was commissioned an officer in a mounted regiment. Badly wounded in the arm during the Mexican-American War, Maury was promoted for bravery and sent home to Virginia to recuperate. After recovering from his wound, Maury was appointed an instructor at West Point, where he served from 1847 until 1852. During the 1850s, Maury returned to field service and carried out various assignments in Pacific Northwest and Texas. In the late 1850s, he was stationed at the Cavalry School at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, where he wrote <hi rend='italic'>Tactics for Mounted Rifles</hi>, which became a standard training manual for the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P1'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Maury was in New Mexico Territory serving as assistant adjutant general. He resigned from the U.S. Army and returned to Virginia to volunteer for Confederate service. He received an appointment as a colonel and eventually became chief of staff under General Earl Van Dorn in the Trans-Mississippi region. Following Van Dorn’s loss at Pea Ridge, Maury was promoted to brigadier general and given command of a division. He led troops at the Second Battle of Corinth in October 1862, and was again promoted (to major general) the following month. Maury participated in various operations in Mississippi and Alabama. During the last two years of the war he commanded the Department of the Gulf and performed well in the defense of Mobile.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P2'>At the end of the Civil War, Maury returned to Virginia and founded a school in Fredericksburg. He later pursued a business venture in New Orleans, but the effort failed and Maury struggled financially. He had much greater success as an academic, founding the Southern Historical Society in 1869 and providing many of his own writings on southern history. While articles by former Confederates published by the historical society helped establish Lost Cause mythology (the effort to celebrate the Confederacy and separate the institution of slavery from the cause of the war), Maury did not use his writings to self-promote or attack rivals. His publications were appreciated by former Confederates and former Union officers as being fair and well written. His book <hi rend='italic'>Recollections of a Virginian in the Mexican, Indian, and Civil Wars</hi>, published in 1894, received wide praise for its candor and humor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P3'>Maury maintained an interest in military training, lobbying in the 1870s to reorganize a national militia and the authoring the book <hi rend='italic'>Skirmish Drill for Mounted Troops</hi> in 1886. He also received an appointment as U.S. minister to Colombia from President Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P4'>Maury was married to Nannie Rose Mason. He had five children. Maury died on January 11, 1900, in Peoria, Illinois, at his son’s house. He is buried at Confederate Cemetery in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32122868P0'>The Trans-Mississippi Department was a geographical command of the Confederate Army established on May 26, 1862 and organized from the merger of the Trans-Mississippi District of the former Department No. 2 with the Department of Texas. It encompassed the entirety of the states of Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, and included Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) and Louisiana west of the Mississippi River. It also included the Confederate-claimed Arizona Territory (part of present-day Arizona and New Mexico), which overlapped the New Mexico Territory of the United States. It was first headquartered at Little Rock Arkansas, and later, at Alexandria and Shreveport, Louisiana. Its first commander was Brig. Gen. Paul O Hébert (May 26, 1862–June 20, 1862). It was later commanded by Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman (July 20–July 16, 1862), Lt. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes (July 16, 1862–February 9, 1863), Lt. Gen. Edmund K. Smith (February 9, 1863–April 19, 1865), Lt. Gen. Simon B. Buckner (April 19– 22, 1865) and Gen. (April 22–May 26, 1865). The fall of Vicksburg on July 4, 1865 gave Union forces control over the entire Mississippi River and cut off the Department from the rest of the Confederacy. With the loss of support of the Confederate government in Richmond, it established bureaus that mirrored those of the War Department to perform support functions for the Army. These bureaus were legalized by an act of the First Confederate Congress on February 17, 1864. It became defunct when it surrendered to Union forces on May 26, 1865.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99586P0'>Operating nationally, the Provisional Confederate Congress established the War Department by an act on February 21, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama. The department was led by the Secretary of War, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It was initially led by LeRoy Pope Walker from February 25–September 16, 1861 and later led by Judah P. Benjamin (September 17, 1861–March 24, 1862), George W. Randolph (March 24–November 15, 1862), James Seddon (November 21, 1862–February 5, 1865), and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge (February 6–May 10, 1865). The War Department was responsible for the administration of the Confederate Army and managed all matters pertaining to American Indian tribes within the boundaries of the Confederate States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013536P0'>The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of Southern History</hi>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum)
