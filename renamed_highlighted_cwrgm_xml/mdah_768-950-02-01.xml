                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS54036P0'>Nathan Bedford Forrest was a Confederate cavalry commander and later the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P1'>Born on July 13, 1821, in Bedford County, Tennessee, he became his family’s caretaker at age sixteen when his father died. He pursued numerous types of business as a young man, including gambling, farming, and slave trading. When the Civil War began in 1861, Forrest was one of the wealthiest men in the south, owning more than three thousand acres in Mississippi, as well as plantations in Tennessee and Arkansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P2'>He volunteered for Confederate service in 1861 and soon received command of the Third Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. He had no formal military training—and little formal education—yet, proved a natural leader and military tactician. He scored numerous military victories as a cavalry commander, and showed skill in avoiding capture or defeat by Union troops. In February 1862, when Ulysses S. Grant’s troops besieged Confederate troops at Fort Donelson, Forrest led nearly four thousand southern soldiers in escaping across the Cumberland River before the fort fell to the federal units. During the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi in 1863, Forrest was a brigadier general leading Confederate raids on Grant’s supply lines, causing havoc and frustrating federal efforts to stop his cavalry force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P3'>By 1864, Forrest had been promoted to major general. He continued to see great success in raids behind Union lines and through mounting attacks against smaller contingents of Union soldiers. In April 1864, he led Confederate troops against a federal garrison at Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Forrest’s men overran the fort and, according to many witness accounts, began murdering Black Union soldiers who had surrendered to the Confederates. The event became one of the most famous atrocities of the Civil War, widely publicized and investigated by federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P4'>While much of the Confederacy’s military future grew dim in 1864, as William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army advanced upon Atlanta, and Grant’s Union forces backed Robert E. Lee into a defensive position around Richmond, Virginia, Forrest remained mobile and dangerous, scoring notable victories even when outnumbered, such as the Battle of Brice’s Cross Roads in June 1864 in Mississippi. He was promoted to lieutenant general in February 1865, and remained in the field until April 1865, when he surrendered to Union forces in the wake of the Confederacy’s collapse. By the time the Civil War ended, Forrest had been wounded four times, reportedly had twenty-nine horses shot out from under him, and claimed to have killed or defeated thirty Union soldiers in hand-to-hand combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P5'>Following the war, Forrest lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and pursued a career in railroad development. His ventures ultimately were not successful, and he was nearly bankrupt. He moved onto a large plantation on the Mississippi River that used convicts for labor, in a system similar to slavery. Apart from his financial efforts, Forrest’s early postwar activities involved a prominent role in the Ku Klux Klan. Elected the terror organization’s first Grand Wizard in 1867. He helped recruit former Confederates and white southern men to the group as an effort to resist Reconstruction and Republican policies. However, Forrest became disenchanted with the lack of order and discipline he saw during the Klan’s its rapid expansion. In 1869, he tried to dissolve the Klan and ordered its members to destroy their robes and hoods. By the mid-1870s, Forrest began making public speeches advocating for better protection of Black civil rights. These actions caused rebuke from many of his former Confederate colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P6'>Forrest died of diabetes October 29, 1877. He was married to Mary Ann Montgomery and had two children. Forrest was initially buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Then, in 1904, city officials moved his remains (and those of his wife) to a city park named in his honor. In 2021, his remains were moved again, this time to Columbia, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53950P0'>Richard “Dick” Taylor was Louisiana state senator and a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P1'>Born on January 27, 1826, near Louisville, Kentucky, Richard Taylor was the son of Zachary Taylor—famed Mexican-American War general and president of the United States. Richard, who went by the nickname “Dick,” attended private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts, before attending Harvard College. He transferred to Yale for his university studies and graduated in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P2'>Taylor briefly served in the Mexican-American War under his father, but left Mexico due to health problems. He traveled to Mississippi to manage a cotton plantation owned by his family, and then moved to Louisiana after he inherited a sugar plantation following his father’s death in 1850 while president. Dick Taylor expanded the size of the Louisiana plantation property and its slave population, eventually owning around two hundred enslaved people. Taylor married Louise Marie Mythe Bringer, the daughter of a wealthy family in Louisiana, and became one of the richest men in the state. In the 1855 Taylor won a seat in the Louisiana Senate as a Whig, but changed to the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigrant political party) before joining the Democratic Party by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P3'>When the deep southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Taylor opposed secession. However, he placed his loyalty behind the Confederacy at the outbreak of war and received a commission as colonel of the Ninth Louisiana Infantry Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Virginia, missing the First Battle of Bull Run at Manassas by only hours.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P4'>Taylor was promoted to brigadier general in October 1861 and commanded a brigade under Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in Virginia in 1862. He performed well in several battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including the First Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Port Republic. In June 1862, Taylor received a promotion to major general, making him the youngest officer of that rank in the Confederacy. The new rank led to a new assignment, which involved raising soldiers in western Louisiana. When he arrived there, Union forces already occupied several parts of the state. Taylor led Confederate troops in several battles against federal soldiers in Louisiana, and led raids against Ulysses S. Grant’s army and supplies during the Vicksburg campaign. In 1864, Taylor successfully repulsed Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’ Red River Campaign in Louisiana. However, Taylor believed he had lost a chance to decisively beat Banks due to decisions by Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P5'>In 1865, Taylor was briefly placed in command of the remnants of General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, after its disastrous Nashville campaign. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama on May 4, 1865, was paroled a few days later, and returned to Louisiana to find his sugar plantation destroyed. He moved his family to New Orleans and remained there through the Reconstruction period. After his wife died in 1875, Taylor moved with the couple’s three children to Winchester, Virginia. He passed away in 1870 while visiting a friend in New York City. Taylor is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32049569P0'>John Bell Hood was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P1'>Born in June 1831 in Owingsville, Kentucky, Hood graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1853. Not a particularly good student, as he graduated forty-fourth out of fifty-two students, Hood was nonetheless a competent soldier, and was even offered the position of chief cavalry instructor at West Point several years later (although he turned it down). Hood was initially commissioned as a lieutenant in the Fourth U.S. Infantry Regiment, but later joined the Second U.S. Cavalry Regiment in Texas. Within that unit he served under Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston and Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee, both future Confederate generals. Hood saw his first combat while with the cavalry regiment in Texas. In 1857, he was wounded in the hand by an arrow while battling Comanches at Devil’s River, Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P2'>Hood was still on active duty with the U.S. Army when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Although his native state of Kentucky remained in the Union, he sympathized with the Confederacy and resigned his commission. He initially entered the Confederate army as a cavalry officer and won a skirmish against Union troops near Newport News, Virginia, in the summer of 1861. That September, he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the Fourth Texas Infantry Regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P3'>Hood proved to be a good and popular commander. By February 1862 he received command of a new brigade, made up mostly of Texas Regiments—leading it to be called the Texas Brigade. Promoted to brigadier general in March 1862, he personally led his Texans in several battles in Virginia that year. Confederate leaders appreciated Hood’s aggression and success, rewarding him with division command in July 1862 and the promotion to major general. He and his brigade were prominent in several notable battles, such as Second Bull Run and Antietam, earning a reputation as hard fighters. That notoriety, though, came at the cost of heavy casualties.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P4'>Hood was seriously wounded in the arm by a Union artillery shell at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. He spent several weeks recuperating in Richmond, Virginia, before being sent to Tennessee with his division to support Confederate general Braxton Bragg. He participated in the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863 and again was severely wounded in the right leg. Doctors amputated the leg four inches below the hip. Although not expected to survive the wound and surgery, Hood made a strong recovery. During his second time recuperating in Richmond, Virginia, he made a good impression on President Jefferson Davis. Additionally, Hood was promoted to lieutenant general after his actions at Chickamauga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P5'>Although missing a leg and unable to fully use his left arm, Hood returned to the field in the spring of 1864 and participated in the Confederate efforts to defend Atlanta, Georgia, from William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army. Hood’s army commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, fought a tactical withdrawal over several weeks, allowing Sherman to slowly approach the Georgia city. Hood advocated for more aggression, worried of the frequent retreats. He expressed his concerns of Johnston’s tactics to President Davis and others in Richmond. Sharing his concern, Confederate officials relieved Johnston’s from command and placed Hood in command of the Army of Tennessee. True to his reputation of aggression, Hood launched several attacks against Sherman’s army, but ultimately failed to keep the Union force from surrounding Atlanta. In September 1864, Hood abandoned the city, resulting in Sherman scoring one of the biggest Union victories of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P6'>Unable to defeat Sherman’s army in direct combat, Hood led his army north into Tennessee, intending to draw the Union troops out of Georgia. The effort did not work, though, as other Union armies moved forward to contest Hood while Sherman led most of his army in a march across Georgia to Savannah in late 1864. Hood fought seven battles in Tennessee in late 1864—the last two being costly defeats at Franklin and Nashville. Failing to achieve any notable success, Hood led his survivors to Tupelo, Mississippi, for the winter, and was relieved of his command in January 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P7'>In March 1865, Hood traveled to the Trans-Mississippi Theater, hoping to bring soldiers from the far west to support fighting in the east. However, before he could carry out his plan, Confederate forces across the south began surrendering to Union armies. Hood surrendered to federal soldiers in Natchez, Mississippi, and was paroled shortly afterwards.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P8'>Hood worked as a cotton broker and insurance executive in Louisiana after the Civil War. He began writing an autobiography, largely intended to justify his wartime actions, but did not finish the book before his death. Hood married Anna Marie Hennen in 1868 and the couple had eleven children in those ten years (including three sets of twins). In 1878, a yellow fever epidemic struck the Mississippi and Louisiana area. Hood died of the disease on August 30, 1878; his wife and his oldest daughter also passed away. Hood’s ten orphan children were adopted out to seven families. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25011848P0'>William Tecumseh Sherman was a Union general most famous for capturing Atlanta, Georgia, and conducting a military campaign across Georgia, helping bringing an end to the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P1'>Born on February 8, 1820, in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman was the son of a large and prestigious family. However, his father died suddenly in 1829, leading to Sherman and his siblings being sent to live with friends and family. Sherman moved in with Thomas Ewing, who later became a United States senator. Ewing helped Sherman receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1840 and saw service in Florida during the Seminole Wars.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P2'>Sherman was sent to California during the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s and missed the field experience and promotions many of his military colleagues enjoyed during campaigns in Mexico. He married Ellen Boyle Ewing, one Ewing’s daughters, in 1850. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage. He remained in military service in California until 1853, when he resigned and went into banking. He proved moderately successful, but left California in the late 1850s and moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, to work as an office manager in a law firm operated by two of his wife’s brothers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P3'>In 1859, Sherman received an offer to be superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning &amp; Military Academy in Pineville, Louisiana. (The school would later become Louisiana State University.) He proved to be an effective teacher and school administrator, and was popular among students and faculty. However, when the Civil War broke out in 1861, Sherman resigned from the position and traveled north to volunteer for Union military service. He was commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S. Infantry Regiment, and then placed in command of a brigade of volunteers in Virginia. He led the brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The battle was an embarrassing defeat for the Union Army, but Sherman performed well and was promoted to brigadier general. He was sent to Kentucky to assist federal military operations in the west.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P4'>While in Kentucky, Sherman expressed his belief that the conflict would be long and bloody. He received criticism for this unpopular opinion, although he was later proven entirely correct. In late 1861, Sherman began to suffer from depression, contemplating suicide, and resigned from his position in Kentucky. After recuperating for several weeks, he returned to service in December 1861 and was placed in charge of logistical operations in the Department of the Mississippi. In that role he supported Ulysses S. Grant’s successful capture of Fort Donelson, and was so impressed by the victory that he requested to serve under Grant, despite technically having higher seniority in rank. In March 1862, the War Department granted Sherman’s wish and was given command of a division within Grant’s Army of West Tennessee, helping establish one of the most effective partnerships in U.S. military history.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P5'>Only a month later, in April 1862, Sherman’s division was overrun by Confederate troops under Albert Sidney Johnston during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh. Sherman rallied many of his soldiers and, alongside Grant, the next day counterattacked and pushed the southern troops back to win the battle. Sherman was wounded twice at Shiloh, and had three horses shot from under him. Grant was impressed with Sherman’s performance, and the War Department promoted him to major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P6'>Over the next two years, Sherman became one of Grant’s most trusted subordinates, leading part of Grant’s army during the Vicksburg campaign and during engagements around Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1863. In the spring of 1864, when Grant received promotion as overall commander of Union armies, Sherman was placed in command of federal troops in the western theater. Grant relocated to Virginia to lead Union forces against Robert E. Lee’s famed Army of Northern Virginia while Sherman crafted a plan to drive an army into the heart of the Confederacy. In early 1864, he launched a campaign from Chattanooga to capture the major industrial city of Atlanta. Over the course of several weeks, he commanded three Union armies in a coordinated advance against Confederate forces under Joseph E. Johnston. Sherman captured Atlanta in September 1864, strongly boosting northern morale and aiding to Abraham Lincoln’s reelection in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P7'>Following his capture of Atlanta, Sherman embarked on an even bolder campaign. Leaving two of his three armies to watch a Confederate army under John Bell Hood in Tennessee, Sherman personally took command of his third army and ordered it to march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah. The effort involved a great deal of risk, as it saw Sherman’s army cut off from other Union forces, with no base of supply or reinforcements. With 60,000 soldiers, Sherman advanced across Georgia, destroying buildings, burning crops, and generally bringing destruction to southern communities not yet exposed to the realities of war. His army killed relatively few people compared to that seen in other Civil War campaigns, as southern commanders could not field a sufficient force in Georgia to attack the federals in force. However, the psychological effect was monumental, and his capture of Savannah on December 21, 1864, electrified the north and convinced many southerners that the Confederacy was doomed.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P8'>After reaching Savannah, Sherman turned his army northward and marched through South Carolina, the first state to secede. His troops again burned buildings and crops on his way to Columbia. They captured the city on February 17, 1865, and the city burned that night and the next day. While many blamed Sherman’s Union soldiers for destroying South Carolina’s capital out of vengeance, some of the fires may have been caused by Confederate soldiers trying to destroy large stores of cotton before abandoning the city. Sherman then continued northward into North Carolina and defeated Joseph E. Johnston’s army shortly after Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P9'>Despite his reputation for destruction during the war, Sherman held no animosity toward former Confederates. In fact, his initial terms of surrender to Confederate forces in North Carolina were considered too lenient and were overruled by federal officials, who were especially enraged by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln only days earlier.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P10'>After the war, Sherman remained in the army and was promoted to lieutenant general. During the late 1860s, he oversaw U.S. military operations in the west against Native Americans. In 1869, after Grant won election as president of the United States, Sherman was promoted to full general and made Commanding General of the United States Army. He remained in that position until 1883. Three years before he retired, during a speech to a large crowd in Columbus, Ohio, Sherman stated, “There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.” Within months, the line had become immortalized as “War is hell.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P11'>Sherman spent his last years in New York City, attending social events and entertaining guests and notable public figures. Among the people he routinely conversed with was his former enemy, Joseph E. Johnston. The two ex-generals highly respected each other. Sherman was briefly considered as a candidate for president in 1884, but stated that he would refuse to serve in that office even if elected.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P12'>Sherman died on February 14, 1891, at the age of 71. Joseph E. Johnston attended a large funeral for Sherman in New York as an honorary pallbearer, and stood in the cold rain without a hat out of respect. When cautioned that he should cover up to prevent getting sick, Johnston reportedly said, “If I were in [Sherman’s] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat.” Johnston in fact did become sick shortly after Sherman’s funeral and passed away from pneumonia a few weeks later. Sherman's remains were transported to Missouri for final interment. Today he is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32122869P0'>The Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana (also known as the Department of Alabama and East Mississippi) was established in January 1864 when Alabama was incorporated into the former Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. Headquartered at Meridian, Mississippi, it was a geographical command of the Confederate Army that encompassed the entirety of the states of Alabama and Mississippi and the area of Louisiana east of the Mississippi River. On May 8, 1864 its boundaries were redefined to include parts of Tennessee. It was first commanded by Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk (January 28–May 4, 1864) and later by Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Lee (May 4–July 26, 1864). After Lee, command alternated between Maj. Gen. Dabney H. Maury and Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor. Maj. Gen. Dabney H. Maury (July 26–August 15, 1864) Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor (August 15–November 22, 1864), Maj. Gen. Dabney H. Maury (November 22–December 12, 1864), and Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor (December 12, 1864–May 4, 1865). It became defunct when Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor surrendered to Union forces on May 4, 1865.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
