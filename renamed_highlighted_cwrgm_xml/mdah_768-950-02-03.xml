                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53950P0'>Richard “Dick” Taylor was Louisiana state senator and a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P1'>Born on January 27, 1826, near Louisville, Kentucky, Richard Taylor was the son of Zachary Taylor—famed Mexican-American War general and president of the United States. Richard, who went by the nickname “Dick,” attended private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts, before attending Harvard College. He transferred to Yale for his university studies and graduated in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P2'>Taylor briefly served in the Mexican-American War under his father, but left Mexico due to health problems. He traveled to Mississippi to manage a cotton plantation owned by his family, and then moved to Louisiana after he inherited a sugar plantation following his father’s death in 1850 while president. Dick Taylor expanded the size of the Louisiana plantation property and its slave population, eventually owning around two hundred enslaved people. Taylor married Louise Marie Mythe Bringer, the daughter of a wealthy family in Louisiana, and became one of the richest men in the state. In the 1855 Taylor won a seat in the Louisiana Senate as a Whig, but changed to the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigrant political party) before joining the Democratic Party by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P3'>When the deep southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Taylor opposed secession. However, he placed his loyalty behind the Confederacy at the outbreak of war and received a commission as colonel of the Ninth Louisiana Infantry Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Virginia, missing the First Battle of Bull Run at Manassas by only hours.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P4'>Taylor was promoted to brigadier general in October 1861 and commanded a brigade under Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in Virginia in 1862. He performed well in several battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including the First Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Port Republic. In June 1862, Taylor received a promotion to major general, making him the youngest officer of that rank in the Confederacy. The new rank led to a new assignment, which involved raising soldiers in western Louisiana. When he arrived there, Union forces already occupied several parts of the state. Taylor led Confederate troops in several battles against federal soldiers in Louisiana, and led raids against Ulysses S. Grant’s army and supplies during the Vicksburg campaign. In 1864, Taylor successfully repulsed Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’ Red River Campaign in Louisiana. However, Taylor believed he had lost a chance to decisively beat Banks due to decisions by Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P5'>In 1865, Taylor was briefly placed in command of the remnants of General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, after its disastrous Nashville campaign. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama on May 4, 1865, was paroled a few days later, and returned to Louisiana to find his sugar plantation destroyed. He moved his family to New Orleans and remained there through the Reconstruction period. After his wife died in 1875, Taylor moved with the couple’s three children to Winchester, Virginia. He passed away in 1870 while visiting a friend in New York City. Taylor is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
