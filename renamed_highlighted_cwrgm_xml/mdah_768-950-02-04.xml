                    <p xml:id='OTPS84072P0'>Absolom Madden West was a Confederate general, a Mississippi politician, railroad executive, and vice presidential candidate. Born in Alabama in 1818, West moved to Mississippi around 1837 to establish a plantation with property he acquired from federal land grants. He entered Mississippi state politics as a Whig and won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1847. He married Caroline O. Glover in the 1840s and the couple had four surviving children, born between 1849 and 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P1'>In 1853, he took an office job with the new Mississippi Central Railroad, gaining experience not only in railroad development but corporate and logistical operations. As a Whig, West originally opposed secession. However, after Mississippi left the Union in 1861, during the secession crisis that split the country following Abraham Lincon’s election to president in November 1860, West offered his loyalty and services to the state. He was promoted a brigadier general in the Mississippi state militia, and helped raised a regiment of volunteers. Recognizing his skill and experience in administrative and logistical work, state officials appointed him to several different managerial roles, such as quartermaster general, paymaster general, and commissary general of the militia. He made recommendations to the state legislature to improve the accounting of funds, and was the only state officer to have his accounting books in order and submitted at the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P2'>West took the role of president over the Mississippi Central Railroad around 1864. He remained in that position until around the end of the war, then returned to state politics—again serving in the Mississippi Senate—after the Illinois Central purchased the Mississippi Central. West was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the early effort by the Mississippi government in 1865 to earn readmission to the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, he was among the Mississippi delegation refused seats in Congress when Republicans in Washington, D.C., objected to Mississippi’s “Black Codes”—a series of highly discriminatory laws passed in the summer of 1865 to restrict the civil rights of African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P3'>West became involved in labor rights during Reconstruction, helping form a branch of the National Labor Union. Reentering the Mississippi Senate in the early 1870s, around 1876 he broke away from the Democratic Party and joined the emerging “Greenback Party”—an independent, anti-monopoly political party. It united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters, namely the expansion of paper currency believed to help farmers and small businesses. Attesting to the party’s ability to bring former enemies together, the party’s national convention in 1884 nominated former Union general Benjamin Butler (who had been despised within the Confederacy during his occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War) for its presidential candidate and the former Confederate militia general West as vice president. The party polled only a 1.7% of the popular vote in 1884.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P4'>West’s wife Caroline died in 1889 after a long bout of poor health. He died five years later, in 1894.  The couple is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

It became the capital of French Louisiana in 1722 and continued as the capital when Louisiana achieved statehood on April 30, 1812. It became part of Orleans County (now extinct) on the same day. In 1849 it was replaced by Baton Rouge as the state capital, although it temporarily served as the capital again from 1865 until 1880. (Wikipedia; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P0'>Cotton is a native plant to the Americas which produces puffy bolls of soft white fibers used for clothing and fabric production since the prehistoric era. There are two main species of cotton—distinguished primarily by their fiber length. Short staple cotton has shorter fibers but can grow across a broader geographical area in the southern United States. Long staple cotton is considered by many to produce higher quality, softer fibers, but is more tropical and frost sensitive, isolating it to the warm coastal areas of the lower south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P1'>Long staple cotton became a highly prized cash crop for seventeenth and eighteenth century farmers in the lower south, particularly along the South Carolina and Georgia coastline. Sea Island cotton was carefully cultivated and developed by planters who imported long fiber plants from Central and South America to improve the quality. This lucrative crop was labor intensive, requiring laborers to pick the bolls by hand—a task increasingly given to enslaved people. Once collected, the cotton bolls had to be processed to remove seeds so the fibers could be spun into thread and the seeds used for planting or for cottonseed oil production. Early American cotton planters used a simple cotton gin (or cotton engine), originally designed in India in the fifth century, to mechanically separate seeds from the long staple fibers. This basic gin did not work with short fiber cotton. Because of this, short staple cotton was not a popular crop during the colonial era, as the manual labor required to separate seeds from the bolls was time and cost prohibitive.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P2'>This changed in the 1790s when inventor Eli Whitney designed a new cotton gin that could efficiently separate seeds from short staple cotton. The design immediately made the heartier short fiber cotton plant a viable cash crop and spurred the expansion of cotton farming—on large plantations to small farms—across the south. The pursuit of new farmland for cotton production drove westward migration, the displacement of Native Americans in the south, and helped the creation of new states, including Alabama and Mississippi. The cotton gin only mechanized the processing of cotton. Harvesting the cotton bolls was still done by hand (machine harvesting would not become prevalent until the twentieth century). Therefore, the expansion of cotton farms across the south brought with it the rapid growth of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P3'>Planters produced 750,000 bales of cotton in 1830. Twenty years later, in 1850, the south produced 2.85 million bales annually. In 1860, American planters delivered 5.3 million bales. At 400 pounds per bale, the United States produced more than two billion pounds of cotton in 1860. The crop dominated southern agriculture and made the United States one of the world’s top exporters of the product, chiefly to textile mills in England and France. At the eve of the Civil War, southern politicians believed the importance of the south’s cotton exports gave it diplomatic leverage over European powers. Senator James Hammond of South Carolina famously quipped that “no power on earth dares to make war upon [cotton]. Cotton is king.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P4'>Southern secessionist ideas of cotton’s diplomatic influence during the Civil War proved misplaced. The decrease of cotton exports, due to the Union naval blockade and even efforts by Confederate politicians to create international demand by burning 2.5 million bales of southern cotton, failed to coerce England or France to formally side with the Confederacy or make war upon the Union. Strong cotton crops in the 1850s had led to a surplus of cotton in Europe, and Great Britain chose to find alternate sources of cotton (such as India and Egypt) rather than engage embroil itself in the American Civil War. Some desperate southern farmers even traded with federal officials, and occupying Union forces confiscated cotton crops and transferred them north to textile manufacturers in the northeast.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32120458P5'>After the Civil War, cotton production remained an important agricultural interest for the south. The abolition of slavery did not end the role African Americans played as the primary source of labor for cotton harvesting. Freed peoples grew their own cotton crops as tenant farmers or sharecroppers across the south through the late nineteenth century, resulting in the south continually exporting millions of bales each year. Although a lucrative crop, the cotton farmers—white and black—rarely enjoyed wealth from their labor, due to periodic market crashes and competition. Cotton farming did not substantially change until the early twentieth century with the advent of mechanized cotton harvesters. (Wikipedia; census.gov; Eugene R.
