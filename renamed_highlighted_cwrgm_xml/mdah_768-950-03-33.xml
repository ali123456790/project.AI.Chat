                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56823P0'>Thomas Hill Watts, Sr., was the governor of Alabama during the second half of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P1'>Born on January 3, 1819, near Pine Flat, Alabama, Watts graduated from the University of Virginia, studied law, and became a practice attorney in Greenville, Alabama, by 1841. He relocated to Montgomery in 1848, where his law firm thrived. Aside from his legal practice, Watts received a large amount of money as a planter, owning a large amount of land and more than 175 slaves.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P2'>Watts was a Unionist during the growing sectional conflict over slavery in the 1850s. However, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the president in November 1860, Watts joined the call for secession. He served as a delegate at the Alabama secession convention, and was among the officials who signed the ordinance of secession in January 1861. Following an unsuccessful bid for governor of Alabama in 1861, Watts raised the Seventeenth Alabama Infantry Regiment and briefly commanded it as colonel. However, he resigned in 1862 when offered the position as attorney general of the Confederacy by President Jefferson Davis. In that role, Watts helped create the Confederate Supreme Court and defended the Confederacy’s Conscription Act of 1862 which was the first draft law in North America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P3'>In 1863, Watts resigned from the attorney general’s position to run for governor of Alabama again. He won against the incumbent, John Gill Shorter, in part due to his more nationalistic views of the Confederacy, which proved popular among many Alabama citizens who were frustrated with Shorter’s handling of state matters. He battled currency inflation issues and faced an anti-war movement in the Alabama legislature in 1864. Overall, his term in office was filled with internal strife as Union forces campaigned across the south and Confederate armies disintegrated from casualties, defeats, and desertions. He was arrested by Union officials on May 1, 1865, and spent a few weeks in prison before being paroled.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P4'>Union forces had destroyed much of Watts’ plantation and liberated his slaves during the war. He sold a great deal of his plantation to pay debts, and returned to practicing law in Montgomery. He remained active in Democratic politics and worked against Republican Reconstruction, although he did not hold major political office again.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56823P5'>Watts died on September 16, 1892. He was married twice, first to Eliza Brown Allen, who passed away in 1873. He then married Eleanor Clark Noyes in 1875. Watts had a total of eleven children. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Montgomery, Alabama.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P0'>Upon its creation in early 1861, the government of the Confederate States of America sought ways to generate finances to pay for it growing military forces and operations needed for the impending war against the Union. The earliest plans involved taking loans (like $500,000 borrowed from the state of Alabama) and issuing treasury bonds. The first bonds were part of the “Banker Loan” plan, which involved issuing bonds to banks and commercial businesses, who could pay with specie (or hard currency). However, Confederate officials, including the Secretary of the Treasury Christopher G. Memminger, knew these efforts would fall short of providing the Confederacy the millions of dollars needed. Many southerners did not have great amounts of cash or currency to purchase bonds. However, a significant number of white southerners did produce agricultural goods for sale and export. Therefore, in May 1861, the Confederate Congress passed legislation for the first “Produce Loan,” which authorized the Treasury Department to issue $50 million in bonds, payable at 20 years with an interest rate of eight percent, that could be purchased by southern citizens who paid for them with crops or raw goods. The Confederate Treasury did not directly accept crops for bonds with this first Produce Loan, but instead circulated subscription lists for farmers to pledge a specific portion of their products for the bond. The raw goods (most often cotton and tobacco) were placed into a warehouse and the sold by the farmer by a certain date. The net profit from that sale would then be given to the Confederate Treasury in exchange for the bond. This arrangement provided the Confederacy millions of dollars in currency in short order.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P1'>The Confederate Treasury created the Produce Loan Office to manage this new type of loan. Part of its success involved generating public interest; therefore, loan officials held rallies and events to play upon Confederate patriotism. The response was strong initially. Within a few weeks, Confederate president Jefferson Davis reported to Congress that the effort promised to raise as much as $50 million. In reality, the initial Produce Loan brought slightly less than $17 million to the Confederate Treasury, but the sudden surge of cash boosted confidence in the government and provided badly needed revenue to fund the Confederate military.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P2'>In August 1861, the Confederate Congress authorized another Produce Loan, this one for $100 million worth of treasury bonds. It functioned the same as the original $50 million Produce Loan but expanded the type of payment accepted for the bonds, including treasury notes, specie, and foreign bills of exchange. The second Produce Loan netted the Confederate government around $17.5 million. A third Produce Loan passed Congress in April 1862, this one for $250 million in bonds, which took payment options even further. This third loan accepted payment in kind—farmers or planters could directly trade cotton, tobacco, and wool for treasury bonds. The Produce Loan Office recorded nearly $36 million in revenue from this last loan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P3'>The Produce Loan Office continued to oversee produce loan operations for the Confederacy until the end of the war. It played a vital role in financing the government, and in trying to reduce inflation rates among treasury notes. Additionally, the office was tasked with managing other loan and tax efforts, such as the Cotton Loans and Tithe Taxes in 1863 and 1864, which involved the Confederate government receiving millions of dollars worth of raw goods. Overall, the Produce Loan Office oversaw the receipt of $71.5 million dollars in revenue.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024439P4'>The Produce Loan Office (which had officially been upgraded to a bureau in 1863) spent the last months of the war trying to sell or relocate large stores of Confederate cotton and other supplies before encroaching Union armies could capture or destroy it. With the collapse of the Confederacy, so too did the Produce Loan Office dissolve. (Michael A. Martorelli, “Financing the Civil War,” Essential Civil War Curriculum; Richard C. Todd, “The Produce Loans: A Means of Financing the Confederacy,” <hi rend='italic'>The North Carolina Historical Review</hi>, 46–74)
