                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P0'>During the American Civil War, to disband a military unit was to formally dissolve it. Once dissolved, soldiers returned to their state capitals to deposit their weapons and other publicly owned property. Units were disbanded for a number of reasons throughout the war, including the end of their service agreement and surrender. Frequently, officers disbanded a unit with diminished strength and reorganized it to form a full strength unit. As the Lieber Code did not recognize un-uniformed guerrilla fighters, it was also common for leaders of guerrilla units, like Confederate Col. John Singleton Mosby, to disband their command rather than formally surrender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25023805P1'>Following Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in April 1864, the enormous process of demobilizing all Confederate armies began. The terms for disbanding Confederate military units Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant offered Lee were mimicked by other Union commanders. Rather that disbanding the men without any restraints, Grant classified them as paroled prisoners of war, which would legally forbid them for taking up arms against the United States again.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P0'>By 1862 the initial waves of men who enlisted into Confederate military service diminished as enthusiasm for the war diminished, and both the Union and Confederacy enacted drafts to fill their armies. Nearly one year before the Union (March 1863), the Confederacy instituted a national draft in April 1862. There were important social implications to this policy, especially within the exemptions the Union and Confederacy provided. Similar to the Union, the Confederate act allowed drafted men to hire substitutes to serve in their place (often lower-class men willing to serve for much-needed income) and excused men from military service for medical reasons, "workers deemed necessary to maintain society," including select government employees. And unlike the Union, beginning in October 1862, men who enslaved a minimum of twenty (later fifteen) people were exempt.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009736P1'>The Twenty-Slave Law exemption was a reaction to President Abraham Lincoln's recent announcement of the<lb/>
Emancipation Proclamation. While many southern whites worried about enslaved people uprising with so many white men away at war, these policies cultivated a feeling among impoverished people that they were doing the majority of fighting and suffering for a “rich man's war.” Scholars like Joseph Glathaar proved this was not the case in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia where the wealthy were overrepresented compared with impoverished soldiers, but it is unclear if this was the case in areas like Mississippi, and the perception of unfair protections for the wealthy fueled resentment.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
