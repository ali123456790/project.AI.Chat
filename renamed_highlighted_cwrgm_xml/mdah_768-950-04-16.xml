                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32020575P0'>William Lindsay Brandon was a physician, politician, and Confederate general from Mississippi during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32020575P1'>Born around 1801 in Mississippi Territory, Brandon attended Washington College (today known as Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia, and then studied medicine at the College of New Jersey (modern-day Princeton). He returned to Mississippi to practice medicine. Brandon also became a wealthy landowner and planter, with more than sixty slaves. He was elected to the Mississippi legislature in the 1820s, while his brother, Gerard Brandon, was governor of the young state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32020575P2'>Brandon volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848. He served in the Mississippi militia, rising to the rank of major general. After that war, he returned to running his plantation and provide some medical services to Mississippians for the next several years. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Brandon offered his services to the Confederate army. At nearly sixty years old, he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He traveled with the regiment to Virginia and saw action in several battles in the eastern theater. At the Battle of Malvern Hill in July 1862, Brandon was shot in the ankle, and had part of his lower leg amputated. Despite his age and injury, he returned to his unit months later with a wooden prosthetic leg, and participated in the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. He was promoted to colonel following that engagement and commanded the regiment at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863. However, Brandon resigned his command shortly afterwards due to his physical condition. Brandon remained in the military service and received command of the Reserve Corps of Mississippi. In late 1864 he took charge of the Confederate Bureau of Conscription, to oversee recruitment and the draft of new soldiers in the Confederate army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32020575P3'>After the Civil War, Brandon returned to his plantation. He continued to run the planting operations there until his death on October 8, 1890. He was married twice, first to Ann Davis, with whom he had two children. Ann and both children passed way. Brandon then married Ann Ratliff and had four children, three of which survived to adulthood. His second wife died in 1840. He did not remarry. Brandon was buried on his plantation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P0'>Unlike professional soldiers who may rotate through many units during the course of a military career, most Civil War soldiers were civilians who volunteered only for wartime service and expected to serve their military commitment in their original units. Since units were frequently raised among citizens of a local area, soldiers usually had great pride in their state and regimental affiliations and wanted to remain with their friends and relatives. Additionally, Union and Confederate armies did not normally send replacement soldiers to old regiments to fill the places of men lost from disease, battle, or desertion (Union and Confederate officials preferred to place new recruits in new regiments). Except for officers, who could receive a promotion and transfer to a new command, it was relatively rare for individual soldiers to transfer to a different unit during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P1'>Incidents in which soldiers did transfer into other existing units occurred due to special circumstances. Examples involved direct requests by individuals seeking membership in units with relatives or to leave a unit based upon discontent with the officers. Some requested transfer to a unit with a specialized assignment, or to switch from state guard service to national service or vice versa. In some cases, soldiers were transferred to other units for disciplinary purposes or because of variations in enlistment commitments. Both of these latter scenarios occurred with the 2nd Maine Infantry Regiment. More than sixty soldiers from the unit, who had volunteered for three months, became insubordinate when not allowed to return home after ninety days and were transferred to a New York regiment as a commutation of their original prison sentence. Then, when the 2nd Maine Infantry mustered out of service in June 1863, one hundred and twenty soldiers still owed one year of service, and were transferred to the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment to complete their commitment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32123714P2'>Overall, individual transfer to a different unit was uncommon during the Civil War, and typically occurred on account of special circumstances or by special request. (National Park Service; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

While definitive numbers are not available, the Confederacy's Army ranged between 750,000–1,500,000 soldiers and 483,026 casualties. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
