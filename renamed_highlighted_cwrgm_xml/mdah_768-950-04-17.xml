                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32049569P0'>John Bell Hood was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P1'>Born in June 1831 in Owingsville, Kentucky, Hood graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1853. Not a particularly good student, as he graduated forty-fourth out of fifty-two students, Hood was nonetheless a competent soldier, and was even offered the position of chief cavalry instructor at West Point several years later (although he turned it down). Hood was initially commissioned as a lieutenant in the Fourth U.S. Infantry Regiment, but later joined the Second U.S. Cavalry Regiment in Texas. Within that unit he served under Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston and Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee, both future Confederate generals. Hood saw his first combat while with the cavalry regiment in Texas. In 1857, he was wounded in the hand by an arrow while battling Comanches at Devil’s River, Texas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P2'>Hood was still on active duty with the U.S. Army when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Although his native state of Kentucky remained in the Union, he sympathized with the Confederacy and resigned his commission. He initially entered the Confederate army as a cavalry officer and won a skirmish against Union troops near Newport News, Virginia, in the summer of 1861. That September, he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the Fourth Texas Infantry Regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P3'>Hood proved to be a good and popular commander. By February 1862 he received command of a new brigade, made up mostly of Texas Regiments—leading it to be called the Texas Brigade. Promoted to brigadier general in March 1862, he personally led his Texans in several battles in Virginia that year. Confederate leaders appreciated Hood’s aggression and success, rewarding him with division command in July 1862 and the promotion to major general. He and his brigade were prominent in several notable battles, such as Second Bull Run and Antietam, earning a reputation as hard fighters. That notoriety, though, came at the cost of heavy casualties.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P4'>Hood was seriously wounded in the arm by a Union artillery shell at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. He spent several weeks recuperating in Richmond, Virginia, before being sent to Tennessee with his division to support Confederate general Braxton Bragg. He participated in the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863 and again was severely wounded in the right leg. Doctors amputated the leg four inches below the hip. Although not expected to survive the wound and surgery, Hood made a strong recovery. During his second time recuperating in Richmond, Virginia, he made a good impression on President Jefferson Davis. Additionally, Hood was promoted to lieutenant general after his actions at Chickamauga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P5'>Although missing a leg and unable to fully use his left arm, Hood returned to the field in the spring of 1864 and participated in the Confederate efforts to defend Atlanta, Georgia, from William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army. Hood’s army commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, fought a tactical withdrawal over several weeks, allowing Sherman to slowly approach the Georgia city. Hood advocated for more aggression, worried of the frequent retreats. He expressed his concerns of Johnston’s tactics to President Davis and others in Richmond. Sharing his concern, Confederate officials relieved Johnston’s from command and placed Hood in command of the Army of Tennessee. True to his reputation of aggression, Hood launched several attacks against Sherman’s army, but ultimately failed to keep the Union force from surrounding Atlanta. In September 1864, Hood abandoned the city, resulting in Sherman scoring one of the biggest Union victories of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P6'>Unable to defeat Sherman’s army in direct combat, Hood led his army north into Tennessee, intending to draw the Union troops out of Georgia. The effort did not work, though, as other Union armies moved forward to contest Hood while Sherman led most of his army in a march across Georgia to Savannah in late 1864. Hood fought seven battles in Tennessee in late 1864—the last two being costly defeats at Franklin and Nashville. Failing to achieve any notable success, Hood led his survivors to Tupelo, Mississippi, for the winter, and was relieved of his command in January 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P7'>In March 1865, Hood traveled to the Trans-Mississippi Theater, hoping to bring soldiers from the far west to support fighting in the east. However, before he could carry out his plan, Confederate forces across the south began surrendering to Union armies. Hood surrendered to federal soldiers in Natchez, Mississippi, and was paroled shortly afterwards.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32049569P8'>Hood worked as a cotton broker and insurance executive in Louisiana after the Civil War. He began writing an autobiography, largely intended to justify his wartime actions, but did not finish the book before his death. Hood married Anna Marie Hennen in 1868 and the couple had eleven children in those ten years (including three sets of twins). In 1878, a yellow fever epidemic struck the Mississippi and Louisiana area. Hood died of the disease on August 30, 1878; his wife and his oldest daughter also passed away. Hood’s ten orphan children were adopted out to seven families. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25013556P0'>William Wing Loring was a career soldier who served in the U.S. Army, the Confederate Army, and in the Egyptian Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P1'>Born on December 4, 1818, in Wilmington, North Carolina, Loring moved to Florida with his family as a child. He joined a Florida militia unit at fourteen years old and saw combat against Seminole Indians. At seventeen, he traveled to Texas to fight in the Texas War for Independence, but was brought back to Florida by his father. He rejoined the Florida militia and saw additional action against Seminoles. His family sent him to a boarding school in Virginia in 1837 and he spent two years at Georgetown University, before returning to Florida to study law and become a practicing attorney in 1842. Only a year later, in 1843, Loring won a seat in the Florida House of Representatives and served until 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P2'>In 1846, Loring volunteered for the U.S. Army’s new Regiment of Mounted Rifles (later the Third Cavalry Regiment). The unit was initially intended to serve in the Oregon Territory, but was rerouted to Mexico with the outbreak of the Mexican-American War. Loring fought in several battles during that conflict, receiving two brevet (honorary) promotions for bravery, first to lieutenant colonel and then colonel. He was also severely wounded in the left arm at Mexico City, requiring amputation. Despite the loss of his arm, Loring remained in military service and received orders to lead a wagon train from Missouri Oregon in 1849. He commanded U.S. Army personnel in Oregon Territory for two years and then received various assignments in army forts in other western territories. He participated in several battles against Native Americans in the 1850s and was officially promoted to colonel in 1856. At only 38 years old, he was the young colonel in the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Loring resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. He received a commission as a brigadier general and was ordered to organize and train Confederate soldiers in western Virginia. After mixed success on the battlefield there, he moved his troops to the Shenandoah Valley to link with General Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson. Unhappy with his orders to occupy Winchester, Virginia, during the winter months of early 1862, Loring bypassed Jackson’s authority and petitioned the Confederate high command for the relocation of his force. The incident led to Loring being reassigned away from the Shenandoah and eventually being sent to command a division within General John C. Pemberton’s army in Mississippi. He participated in the Vicksburg Campaign, but his division was cut off from the rest of Pemberton’s army during the Battle of Champion’s Hill and turned eastward to link up with General Joseph E. Johnston, thereby avoiding being captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. Over the next several months, Loring served as a division commander in Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas before surrendering to Union forces in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25013556P4'>After the Civil War, the Khedive of Egypt offered high ranking military positions to respected veterans of the recent conflict. Loring was one of around fifty Union and Confederate veterans recommended by William Tecumseh Sherman for the opportunity, and Loring received an appointment as Inspector General of the Egyptian army. He spent nearly a decade in Egypt serving in campaigns in Africa, attaining a rank equivalent to major general. Loring returned to the United States around 1878. He ran for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida, but lost. He moved to New York City and was there when he died of pneumonia on December 30, 1886. He was never married. Loring’s remains were cremated and initially buried at Grace Episcopal Church in New York City. Only a few months later, his ashes were transported for reinterment in Woodlawn Cemetery in St. Augustine, Florida. They were moved again in 1920 to the Government House in St. Augustine, with a large obelisk over his grave. A century later, in 2020, Loring’s ashes were moved one more time, to a grave on private property.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71087P0'>Winfield Scott Featherston was a U.S. congressman from Mississippi and a general in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P1'>Born on August 8, 1820, near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Featherston volunteered for militia service as a teenager during the Second Creek War in Alabama in 1836. After that conflict, he moved to Mississippi and studied law, becoming a practicing attorney in 1840. Soon after, Featherston became involved in local politics, and won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi in 1846. He served until 1851, then returned to his home in Houston, Mississippi, after losing reelection in 1850. In 1856, he moved to Holly Springs and opened a successful law firm.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P2'>Featherston remained a political figure in Mississippi, particularly during the secession movement following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860. He traveled to Kentucky, as an agent of Mississippi, to encourage secession in that state. When the war broke out in 1861, Featherston received a commission as a colonel and took command of the Seventeenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Sent to Virginia, he led Confederate troops at the First Battle of Bull Run and Ball’s Bluff in Virginia. He was promoted to brigadier general in March 1862 and participated in several major engagements that year, including the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond, the Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P3'>In early 1863, Featherston was transferred to Mississippi. He commanded a brigade during the Vicksburg campaign, seeing combat at Champion’s Hill, and participated in the Atlanta Campaign in 1864. He remained with General John Bell Hood’s army during the disastrous campaign into Tennessee in late 1864, and commanded a brigade in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army during the final weeks of the war in the Carolinas. He surrendered to Union troops in late April 1865, was paroled shortly afterwards, and returned to Holly Springs, Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P4'>Featherston immediately returned to politics after the war, running an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate. He practiced law, and remained active in local political activities opposing Republican Reconstruction. In 1876, he won a seat in the Mississippi legislature and remained there until 1882, when he received an appointment as a district judge. One of his final political acts was as a delegate to Mississippi’s 1890 constitutional convention, which reinstituted many discriminatory policies against African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71087P5'>Featherston was married to Elizabeth McEwen and had seven children. He died in 1891 and is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P0'>The term cavalry referred to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of Civil War armies, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies typically used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P1'>Confederate cavalrymen enjoyed a reputation of superiority over their Union counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that Confederate cavalry soldiers often had to provide their own horses (something less common in the Union army) and therefore were more experienced and comfortable with their steeds. Two other theories are that Southern aristocratic culture placed higher value on horsemanship than northern communities, and that men who grew up in the South’s largely agricultural society were more familiar with horses than those from the industrial North. All of these explanations may have some merit, but exaggerate the differences between North and South, and cannot account for any great disparity in cavalry actions within the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32013717P2'>More important reasons for Confederate cavalry’s positive reputation included some high-profile leaders and notable early war victories. J.E.B. Stuart’s battlefield success in the Eastern Theater during the first two years, coupled with his flamboyant style, made him and his horse soldiers celebrities in the South, while other cavalry commanders, like John Hunt Morgan, John Singleton Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, used aggressive and rapid cavalry raids to disrupt northern supply lines, defeat isolated federal troops, and generally tie up exponentially larger Union forces. Despite these early and famous Confederate successes, Union cavalry forces improved in quality and quantity during the course of the war, culminating in a fight to a draw at Brandy Station—the largest cavalry battle in North America—in June 1863. During the last two years of the war, Confederate cavalry did not enjoy its reputation of dominance, although it still managed to play a large role in scouting, raiding, and resisting Union forces.
