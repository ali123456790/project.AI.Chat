                    <p xml:id='OTPS86155P0'>John H. Echols was secretary of state, state treasurer, and a revenue agent in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P1'>Born on September 1, 1835, in Huntsville, Alabama, Echols moved to Jackson, Mississippi, during his childhood. He worked for the state government as a young man, and impressed Mississippi officials so much with his intellect and abilities that he was appointed secretary of state during the Civil War. Shortly after the war ended, Echols was appointed state treasurer. He held the position until 1869, maintaining a reputation for integrity and intelligence.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P2'>In 1871, he took a job as a commissioner and agent of the Mobile &amp; Northwestern Railroad, a position that required salesmanship to receive land and money donations to the railroad’s development. Then, in 1876, he was appointed a revenue agent for Mississippi, a position created that year by the state legislature to investigate and litigate cases in which county tax collections were not properly submitted to the state government. He worked as the revenue agent until 1880.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P3'>Echols suffered from Bright’s disease—a kidney ailment—and died on January 29, 1882, after weeks of failing health. He was married twice, first to Medora Ware, who passed away in 1875. He then married Sarah Schackleford. Echols is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS55219P0'>M. D. Haynes was a public official in Mississippi before and during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55219P1'>An active member of the Democratic Party in the 1840s and 1850s, Haynes worked as an editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippian</hi>, a newspaper in Jackson, before seeking the office of State Treasurer in 1859. He won the position and served in that role through the Civil War. Haynes tried very hard to keep Mississippi’s finances in order through the war years, but faced significant hardships due to the strain of war and from Union army campaigns. He moved the treasury office from Jackson to Meridian in May 1863 to avoid Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman, and then to Mobile, Alabama, for fear of Union cavalry raids.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55219P2'>In late 1864, as the Confederacy was falling apart, an audit of Mississippi’s state funds discovered a substantial discrepancy, and officials accused Haynes of owing the state more than $93,000. Governor Charles Clark demanded Haynes’ resignation based upon assumptions that the treasurer had stolen or embezzled the money. On January 2, 1865, Haynes resigned from his position as State Treasurer and committed suicide the same day. Adding to this tragedy was news from a later examination that found Haynes was innocent of the charges. The money shortfall had been the fault of a previous treasurer. Long after his death, Mississippi officials occasionally referenced Haynes’ untimely death, positing that his well-known and frequent use of opium may have contributed to his suicide.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

As I have already stated to you, I had left them in the vault, in two cigar boxes, together with a statement of my last transactions &amp; final settlement with the State. I pointed them out to Col Haynes, when I gave him the kegs, and explained to him their contents, at the same time that I explained to him the contents of other boxes, &amp; pointed out other objects in the vault.

<p corresp='TTP32548539P7' xml:id='OTP32548539P7'>On examination, I found no papers in the vault. But in one corner of the office I found a large box filled with loose papers. There were also some on the floor. There were also some papers on some shelves with glass sliding doors. Among these last I found one of my pay warrants. I was told by one of our officers that when our people retook possession, after the retreat of the <rs ref='#S71916'>Yankees</rs>, they found the floor covered with loose papers. I was also told that our people were in the habit of using those papers—

<p corresp='TTP32548541P1' xml:id='OTP32548541P1'>The committee have erred I think in their estimate of the receipts. They go by the <rs ref='#S55222'>auditors</rs> ledger, which is unreliable as to me, because it may overlap as to time. There is no difficulty as to the receipts by warrants. The doubt is in regard to the receipts from the <rs ref='#S68178'>Sec of states office</rs>—as to Internal Im. fund &amp; as to code money, swamp land fund &amp;c. As to the latter, I examined my receipts to Dilworth—surely the highest source of testimony—with Mr <rs ref='#S86155'>Echols</rs>, and I make these receipts, (for Code Excess &amp;c.) during the months of Nov &amp; Dec 1859, and up to Nov 1<add place='above'>st</add> 1858 to be only $1338.06—as stated in the annxed account.

The best evidence would be the warrants in my hands. The next best evidence is the <hi rend='underline'>absence</hi> of those warrants. The presumption is that if they had been outstanding &amp; unpaid in the hands of <hi rend='underline'>bona fide</hi> holders, they would have been presented for payment before this, as more than five years have elapsed since their issuance. You will recollect the rule of law: "De non existentibus, et non apparentibus, eadem est ratio." The same rule holds as to things not appearing, as to things not existing.
