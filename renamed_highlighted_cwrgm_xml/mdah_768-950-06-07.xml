<p xml:id='OTPS25024625P1'>Born near Danville, Kentucky, on November 15, 1815, Fisher moved to Mississippi as a young man and studied law. He became a practicing attorney in Coffeeville. He briefly served in the Mississippi State Senate but saw longer public service as a justice on the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals, later referred to as Mississippi’s Supreme Court. Fisher was a Whig and initially opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union in 1861, he supported the Confederacy. He volunteered for military service and commanded a company in the Fourth Cavalry of the Mississippi Militia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

<p corresp='TTP32548555P2' xml:id='OTP32548555P2'>Dear Sir—
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32548555P3' xml:id='OTP32548555P3'>I have carefully examined the question—whether the <rs ref='#S25025235'>court martial</rs> could summon delinquents and proceed to <rs ref='#S32121282'>trial</rs>—<rs ref='#S71046'>convict</rs> and fine—and have come to the conclusion that the proceeding would be too hazardous to venture upon—The state of last August in general terms requires the party to be tried before a court martial,—and this means a court martial constitu-ted and the <hi rend='underline'>party before it</hi> according to the <rs ref='#S70882'>army</rs> regulations—which require the presence of the party—
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32548555P4' xml:id='OTP32548555P4'>Besides a court martial is a special tribunal and the record must ^show^ affirmatively every thing necessary to sustain a <rs ref='#S71046'>conviction</rs>—otherwise the civil tribunals might grant writs of prohibition to prevent the enforcement of the judgments—In addition to this, if the <rs ref='#S63395'>courts of law</rs> were to consider the <rs ref='#S32021053'>sentence</rs> a nullity, the members of the court might, perhaps, be liable in damages—
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32548555P5' xml:id='OTP32548555P5'>I would suggest therefore that military courts to cons-ist of these members be organized in lieu of the court marial—with such process as the <rs ref='#S70054'>circuit courts</rs> use in criminal or misdemeanor cases to bring parties before them—that the <rs ref='#S95578'>sheriffs</rs> or military be authorised to execute said process—that the record need not show any thing more than, the record of a court of general Jurisdiction is required to show—that

          <p corresp='TTP32548556P0' xml:id='OTP32548556P0'>the court have power to <rs ref='#S98996'>appoint</rs> a <rs ref='#S50807'>clerk</rs>—or <rs ref='#S63934'>Judge Advocate</rs>, if this name is preferred—that it appoint the time of its sittings—be convened at any time for special cases—that as writ of error be to the <rs ref='#S32032260'>High Court</rs> whenever a <hi rend='underline'>constitutional question</hi> shall be involved—that the members of the court be conservators of the peace—may order the <rs ref='#S62954'>arrest</rs> of persons—especially soldiers, charged with offenses against the laws—or armies—may commit to <rs ref='#S62931'>prison</rs>, or take bail in all bailable cases—That milit-ary offences be bailable—when not capitally punished—&amp;c.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32548556P1' xml:id='OTP32548556P1'>I make these suggestions because <rs ref='#S53668'>assassinations</rs>—and attempts of that kind have been frequent of late—and the civil authorities are either too inefficient or too weak to bring parties to justice—Let the court in all cases have power to order out a sufficient force if necessary to arrest parties guilty of crimes—and let it in all cases where it cannot by the party have power to act as a court of inquiry to send him to the circuit court for trial—
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32548556P2' xml:id='OTP32548556P2'>In addition to this, I would suggest that all military offices under the state, be conservators of the peace, with power to order any members of their respective commands to make arrests and that such officers have power to deal with offenders in the same manner that <rs ref='#S63172'>justices of the peace</rs> can do—or if they prefer, to bring them before the military court or any member thereof for similar action—

          <p corresp='TTP32548557P0' xml:id='OTP32548557P0'>that military officers have power to order out a squad of their respective companies at any time to arrest <rs ref='#S58306'>deserters</rs>—to bring them before the military court or any member thereof, to try the fact whether <del rend='overstrike'>there proof</del> ^there^ is probable cause to believe the parties are deserters—and if so, ^to^ hand them over to the Confederate authorities. <del rend='overstrike'>if Co</del> As the war will probably assume a new phaze this spring, with increased horrors, it would be well to put every man without regard to age, profession or vocation in the service—Nine tenths of the population can stand a short campaign—and if they are all in the service, they are all under military law—and the "<hi rend='underline'>disloyal</hi>" can be dealt with accordingly—if any such there be—If we are in earnest, let our actions furnish the proof—If not, it is too serious a matter, and too costly, merely supply material ^for^ <hi rend='underline'>patriotic</hi> talk on the hustings; and the sooner we close the scene of carnage the better—We, in doing so, might in the wreck, save a few capable of lamenting the degradation of their country—There are men enough in the south, if brought together in an army, to burn up the north—at least to settle <hi rend='underline'>the debt of vengence</hi>—which we so honestly owe them and which I hope Mississippi will never repudiate

<p corresp='TTP32548557P1' xml:id='OTP32548557P1'>I am more explicit on this subject, than might seem to be necessary from the fact that with all the efforts, that I have been able to use since Sept last, I have

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32548558P1' xml:id='OTP32548558P1'>One other subject—Roads are most shamefully neglected—Would it not be well to give the <rs ref='#S63950'>Boards of police</rs> power to fine overseers of roads—and to subje-ct them to damages—say ten dollars to be recovered before a justice of the peace by any person who can show that he has been delayed in consequence of bad roads—
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32548558P2' xml:id='OTP32548558P2'>An other question—<rs ref='#S96659'>Destitute</rs> <rs ref='#S25013472'>families</rs> require cotton to make clothing—Could not part of the <rs ref='#S32025512'>tax</rs> for their benefit be collected in cotton—?—
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32548558P3' xml:id='OTP32548558P3'>In conclusion I will add that a court martial as at present constituted is an intolerably slow and tiresome proceed-ing—A record must be made in every case—and one case <hi rend='underline'>a day</hi> if contested in as much as can be gone through with—and if there should be three or four hundred cases—some occupying a week, years would elapse before they could be tried—Why not adopt a system more expeditious and an hundred fold more likely to attain justice?—It would be well in all cases, even where parties are excused to tax them with the costs—they only do in such cases what the unfortunate have to do in all cases—vindicate themselves at their own costs—or if this is not done, leave it discretionary with the court as to costs—
