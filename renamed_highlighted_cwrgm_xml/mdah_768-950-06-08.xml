                    <p xml:id='OTPS84072P0'>Absolom Madden West was a Confederate general, a Mississippi politician, railroad executive, and vice presidential candidate. Born in Alabama in 1818, West moved to Mississippi around 1837 to establish a plantation with property he acquired from federal land grants. He entered Mississippi state politics as a Whig and won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1847. He married Caroline O. Glover in the 1840s and the couple had four surviving children, born between 1849 and 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P1'>In 1853, he took an office job with the new Mississippi Central Railroad, gaining experience not only in railroad development but corporate and logistical operations. As a Whig, West originally opposed secession. However, after Mississippi left the Union in 1861, during the secession crisis that split the country following Abraham Lincon’s election to president in November 1860, West offered his loyalty and services to the state. He was promoted a brigadier general in the Mississippi state militia, and helped raised a regiment of volunteers. Recognizing his skill and experience in administrative and logistical work, state officials appointed him to several different managerial roles, such as quartermaster general, paymaster general, and commissary general of the militia. He made recommendations to the state legislature to improve the accounting of funds, and was the only state officer to have his accounting books in order and submitted at the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P2'>West took the role of president over the Mississippi Central Railroad around 1864. He remained in that position until around the end of the war, then returned to state politics—again serving in the Mississippi Senate—after the Illinois Central purchased the Mississippi Central. West was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the early effort by the Mississippi government in 1865 to earn readmission to the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, he was among the Mississippi delegation refused seats in Congress when Republicans in Washington, D.C., objected to Mississippi’s “Black Codes”—a series of highly discriminatory laws passed in the summer of 1865 to restrict the civil rights of African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P3'>West became involved in labor rights during Reconstruction, helping form a branch of the National Labor Union. Reentering the Mississippi Senate in the early 1870s, around 1876 he broke away from the Democratic Party and joined the emerging “Greenback Party”—an independent, anti-monopoly political party. It united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters, namely the expansion of paper currency believed to help farmers and small businesses. Attesting to the party’s ability to bring former enemies together, the party’s national convention in 1884 nominated former Union general Benjamin Butler (who had been despised within the Confederacy during his occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War) for its presidential candidate and the former Confederate militia general West as vice president. The party polled only a 1.7% of the popular vote in 1884.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P4'>West’s wife Caroline died in 1889 after a long bout of poor health. He died five years later, in 1894.  The couple is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS72357P0'>Born around 1820 in Alabama, D. S. Pattison was a planter living in Claiborne County, Mississippi by 1850. During the Civil War, he served as a captain in the 2nd Mississippi Batallion (state militia). He was also the agent assigned to purchasing salt for the state of Mississippi. After the war, he resumed work as a farmer in on his plantation in Claiborne County, and in 1878, he shot and killed one of his tenants, a Black man by the name of Hamilton, for insolence. In 1882, he donated land to establish a town that was named Martin until 1912 when it was renamed Pattison after D. S. Pattison.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63111P0'>John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P1'>Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P2'>Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P3'>Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63111P4'>Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P0'>As the American Civil War extended into its third year, the Confederate government found itself deeply indebted and unable to provide food, clothing, and other necessities for its army. On March 26, 1863, the Confederate government passed the Impressment Law. Under this law, state boards of impressment, with the assistance of local commissioners, impressed food, fuel, enslaved persons, and other commodities to support the war effort and to pay off its debts. Commissioners met with local farmers to fix prices for their commodities, subject to revision every two months. One month later, the Confederate government enacted a tax-in-kind. The tax-in-kind required farmers to donate ten percent (to be judged by a collector) of their produce in lieu of taxes paid in currency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P1'>Both of these policies increased tensions between white southerners and the Confederate government. Farmers and their families often felt cheated by government agents offering far less than market value for their goods. Areas close to fighting also disproportionately experienced impressment, as Confederate armies on the ground often stripped their farms clean. The Confederacy also impressed enslaved persons to perform labor, and the brutality of that labor often resulted in the death, injury, or mistreatment of the enslaved, who, if returned at all, did so in much worse condition than they left. The Confederate government also routinely failed to pay for impressed goods and kept enslaved persons longer than their agreed impressment period. Impressment, then, led to protests among rural white southerners, some of whom hoarded their goods from collectors or impersonated collectors in order to acquire food for themselves and their families. The tax-in-kind alone garnered roughly $62 million for the Confederacy from 1863 to 1865, yet combined with impressment, these policies alienated much of the Confederacy's local support and failed to fully pay its debts or win the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25026123P0'>As the American Civil War extended into its third year, the Confederate government found itself deeply indebted and unable to provide food, clothing, and other necessities for its army. On March 26, 1863, the Confederate government passed the Impressment Law. Under this law, state boards of impressment, with the assistance of local commissioners, impressed food, fuel, enslaved persons, and other commodities to support the war effort and to pay off its debts. Commissioners met with local farmers to fix prices for their commodities, subject to revision every two months. One month later, the Confederate government enacted a tax-in-kind. The tax-in-kind required farmers to donate ten percent (to be judged by a collector) of their produce in lieu of taxes paid in currency.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.
