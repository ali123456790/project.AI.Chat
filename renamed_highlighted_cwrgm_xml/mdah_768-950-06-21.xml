                    <p xml:id='OTPS53950P0'>Richard “Dick” Taylor was Louisiana state senator and a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P1'>Born on January 27, 1826, near Louisville, Kentucky, Richard Taylor was the son of Zachary Taylor—famed Mexican-American War general and president of the United States. Richard, who went by the nickname “Dick,” attended private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts, before attending Harvard College. He transferred to Yale for his university studies and graduated in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P2'>Taylor briefly served in the Mexican-American War under his father, but left Mexico due to health problems. He traveled to Mississippi to manage a cotton plantation owned by his family, and then moved to Louisiana after he inherited a sugar plantation following his father’s death in 1850 while president. Dick Taylor expanded the size of the Louisiana plantation property and its slave population, eventually owning around two hundred enslaved people. Taylor married Louise Marie Mythe Bringer, the daughter of a wealthy family in Louisiana, and became one of the richest men in the state. In the 1855 Taylor won a seat in the Louisiana Senate as a Whig, but changed to the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigrant political party) before joining the Democratic Party by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P3'>When the deep southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Taylor opposed secession. However, he placed his loyalty behind the Confederacy at the outbreak of war and received a commission as colonel of the Ninth Louisiana Infantry Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Virginia, missing the First Battle of Bull Run at Manassas by only hours.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P4'>Taylor was promoted to brigadier general in October 1861 and commanded a brigade under Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in Virginia in 1862. He performed well in several battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including the First Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Port Republic. In June 1862, Taylor received a promotion to major general, making him the youngest officer of that rank in the Confederacy. The new rank led to a new assignment, which involved raising soldiers in western Louisiana. When he arrived there, Union forces already occupied several parts of the state. Taylor led Confederate troops in several battles against federal soldiers in Louisiana, and led raids against Ulysses S. Grant’s army and supplies during the Vicksburg campaign. In 1864, Taylor successfully repulsed Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’ Red River Campaign in Louisiana. However, Taylor believed he had lost a chance to decisively beat Banks due to decisions by Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P5'>In 1865, Taylor was briefly placed in command of the remnants of General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, after its disastrous Nashville campaign. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama on May 4, 1865, was paroled a few days later, and returned to Louisiana to find his sugar plantation destroyed. He moved his family to New Orleans and remained there through the Reconstruction period. After his wife died in 1875, Taylor moved with the couple’s three children to Winchester, Virginia. He passed away in 1870 while visiting a friend in New York City. Taylor is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32021899P0'>George Baird Hodge was a lawyer, Confederate politician, and a Confederate military officer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021899P1'>Born on April 8, 1828 in Fleming County, Kentucky, Hodge graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1845 but resigned his commission in 1850. In the 1850s, he practiced law in Newport, Kentucky before being elected into the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1859.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021899P2'>Hodge enlisted into the Confederate Army during the Civil War but was chosen as the Kentucky Representative for the provisional Confederate Congress until 1862. With the creation of the Confederate Congress, Hodge served as the official Representative for Kentucky in the House of Representatives from February 18, 1862 to February 17, 1864. In the Confederate military, he served at the Battle of Shiloh and was a cavalry brigade commander operating under Nathan Bedford Forrest until Forrest relieved him of his command with accusations of cowardice. Hodge was acquitted and promoted to the rank of Colonel and Inpector General. He commanded the District of Southwest Mississippi and East Louisiana after serving his term in Congress. Although it was never confirmed by the Senate and therefore not official, he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General in 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021899P3'>After the Civil War, Hodge returned to Newport, Kentucky where he resumed practicing law. He was elected to the Kentucky Senate in 1873 and served until 1877. In the final years of his life, Hodge moved to Florida where he became an orange grower. He was married to Keturah Moss (Tibbatts) Hodge. The pair had seven children. George B. Hodge died on August 1, 1892 in Longwood, Seminole County, Florida and was buried in Seminole Florida. In 1903, his remains were moved to the Evergreen Cemetery in Southgate, Campbell County, Kentucky.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS54036P0'>Nathan Bedford Forrest was a Confederate cavalry commander and later the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P1'>Born on July 13, 1821, in Bedford County, Tennessee, he became his family’s caretaker at age sixteen when his father died. He pursued numerous types of business as a young man, including gambling, farming, and slave trading. When the Civil War began in 1861, Forrest was one of the wealthiest men in the south, owning more than three thousand acres in Mississippi, as well as plantations in Tennessee and Arkansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P2'>He volunteered for Confederate service in 1861 and soon received command of the Third Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. He had no formal military training—and little formal education—yet, proved a natural leader and military tactician. He scored numerous military victories as a cavalry commander, and showed skill in avoiding capture or defeat by Union troops. In February 1862, when Ulysses S. Grant’s troops besieged Confederate troops at Fort Donelson, Forrest led nearly four thousand southern soldiers in escaping across the Cumberland River before the fort fell to the federal units. During the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi in 1863, Forrest was a brigadier general leading Confederate raids on Grant’s supply lines, causing havoc and frustrating federal efforts to stop his cavalry force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P3'>By 1864, Forrest had been promoted to major general. He continued to see great success in raids behind Union lines and through mounting attacks against smaller contingents of Union soldiers. In April 1864, he led Confederate troops against a federal garrison at Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Forrest’s men overran the fort and, according to many witness accounts, began murdering Black Union soldiers who had surrendered to the Confederates. The event became one of the most famous atrocities of the Civil War, widely publicized and investigated by federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P4'>While much of the Confederacy’s military future grew dim in 1864, as William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army advanced upon Atlanta, and Grant’s Union forces backed Robert E. Lee into a defensive position around Richmond, Virginia, Forrest remained mobile and dangerous, scoring notable victories even when outnumbered, such as the Battle of Brice’s Cross Roads in June 1864 in Mississippi. He was promoted to lieutenant general in February 1865, and remained in the field until April 1865, when he surrendered to Union forces in the wake of the Confederacy’s collapse. By the time the Civil War ended, Forrest had been wounded four times, reportedly had twenty-nine horses shot out from under him, and claimed to have killed or defeated thirty Union soldiers in hand-to-hand combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P5'>Following the war, Forrest lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and pursued a career in railroad development. His ventures ultimately were not successful, and he was nearly bankrupt. He moved onto a large plantation on the Mississippi River that used convicts for labor, in a system similar to slavery. Apart from his financial efforts, Forrest’s early postwar activities involved a prominent role in the Ku Klux Klan. Elected the terror organization’s first Grand Wizard in 1867. He helped recruit former Confederates and white southern men to the group as an effort to resist Reconstruction and Republican policies. However, Forrest became disenchanted with the lack of order and discipline he saw during the Klan’s its rapid expansion. In 1869, he tried to dissolve the Klan and ordered its members to destroy their robes and hoods. By the mid-1870s, Forrest began making public speeches advocating for better protection of Black civil rights. These actions caused rebuke from many of his former Confederate colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P6'>Forrest died of diabetes October 29, 1877. He was married to Mary Ann Montgomery and had two children. Forrest was initially buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Then, in 1904, city officials moved his remains (and those of his wife) to a city park named in his honor. In 2021, his remains were moved again, this time to Columbia, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

On May 8, 1864 its boundaries were redefined to include parts of Tennessee. It was first commanded by Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk (January 28–May 4, 1864) and later by Maj. Gen. Stephen D.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58306P0'>During the American Civil War, desertion primarily indicated one's fleeing from camp and thereby attempting to permanently escape military service altogether rather than one's fleeing from battle when faced with the enemy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P1'>As the war continued past its first few months and the reality of battle disabused men both North and South of the romanticized visions of combat they formerly possessed, both the Union and Confederate armies saw large numbers of deserters. One estimate places roughly 103,000 deserters in the Confederate Army and over 200,000 in the Union Army (Essential Civil War Curriculum).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P2'>Men on both sides deserted for a number of reasons, including poor conditions and the rigor of military camp life, concern for their family's well being at home, low morale after defeats in battle, or general homesickness. Many deserters were of a class known as "bounty jumpers," or those who joined the military to receive an initial payment known as a bounty, only to flee military service immediately afterword. While the Union Army faced a greater total number of desertions, the Confederacy ultimately suffered more from desertion due to its lower total manpower.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD58306P3'>Both sides nonetheless took stern measures to discourage desertion. Punishment of deserters varied on both sides at different points during the war, ranging anywhere from corporal punishment to humiliation or, later in the war, execution. Though only about 400 executions ever took place to punish a much larger number of deserters, it is indicative of the brutal reality of Civil War military service that many men, despite the potential death sentence, still felt compelled to desert (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
