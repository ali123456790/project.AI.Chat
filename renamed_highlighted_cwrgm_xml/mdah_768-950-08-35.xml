                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS58554P0'>Peter Joseph Osterhaus was a Union general during the Civil War who served as chief of staff of the Military Division of West Mississippi, the command over Union forces in the Mississippi area at the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P1'>Born on January 4, 1823, in Koblenz, Prussia (modern-day Germany), Osterhaus attended a military academy in Berlin and became a Prussian army officer in the 1840s. He immigrated to the United States in the 1850s, following a series of revolutions in Prussia. After a short time in Illinois, Osterhaus settled to St. Louis, Missouri, which had a large German American population. Due to his experience and interest in military affairs, he took an active role training German American militia units in that city. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Osterhaus volunteered for Union service. He rose to the rank of major of the Second Missouri Infantry Battalion (Union) and fought at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek in August 1861 in Missouri. Over the next two years, he rose in rank, commanding the Twelfth Missouri Infantry Regiment, and then being placed in charge of a division under Brigadier Franz Sigel, another German American officer. Osterhaus performed well at the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, in March 1862, resulting in his promotion to brigadier general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P2'>Ostherhaus was hospitalized in late 1862 with malaria, he returned to the field in time to command Union soldiers during an assault on Fort Hindman, Arkansas, capturing the Confederate garrison there in January 1863. He then commanded a division of Ulysses S. Grant’s army during the Vicksburg Campaign, fighting at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge. He was wounded in the leg at the latter engagement. Following the campaign for Vicksburg, Osterhaus was sent to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he suffered a battlefield defeat at Ringgold Gap, Georgia, in November 1863, but maintained his reputation as a capable combat commander. In 1864, he was part of William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union successful advance to Atlanta and earned promotion to major general that summer. In March 1865, Osterhaus was appointed chief of staff of the Military Division of West Mississippi, under Major General Edward Canby. The staff assignment did not preclude him from being campaigning in the field, as he participated in battles around Mobile, Alabama, including Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley. He served a conspicuous role in the surrender of Confederate forces in the deep south, in particular being the highest ranking Union officer present when General Edmund Kirby Smith surrendered Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Theater.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P3'>Osterhaus remained in the U.S. Army assisting with early Reconstruction and occupation duties in Mississippi until January 1866. He then received an appointment as U.S. Consul at Lyons, France. In the 1870s, he moved to Germany and received his German citizenship in 1879. He retained his connections to the United States, periodically visiting to attend reunions of the Grand Army of the Republic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P4'>Osterhaus died in Germany on January 2, 1917. He had been married twice; first in 1846 to Matilda Born, who died in 1863, and then in 1864 to Amalie Anna Maria Born, who died in 1896. He had three children by his first wife, and one with his second wife. Osterhaus is buried in Koblenz, Germany.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027652P0'>William Yerger served as a justice on Mississippi’s Supreme Court and in the Mississippi legislature during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P1'>Born on November 22, 1816, in Lebanon, Tennessee, Yerger attended the University of Nashville, studied law, and became a practicing attorney at the age of 21. He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1837 and established a successful law practice. He belonged to the Whig Party, an association some in Mississippi later said slowed his ascent within the state’s strong Democratic public and political setting. However, in 1850 he was elected to Mississippi’s High Bench of Errors and Appeals (later called the Supreme Court). He served on the Court for three years, before returning to legal practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P2'>During the Civil War, Yerger served in the Mississippi legislature, and was active in the immediate postwar effort to reconstruct the state government under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient policies for readmission to the Union. He established a very strong reputation as an attorney and jurist in Mississippi, so much so that the state’s Supreme Court adjourned for a day in his honor upon receiving word of his death on June 7, 1872, at the age of 55. Yerger had been married to Malvina Hogan Rucks and had five children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery at Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P0'>The United States <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 as the foundational code of laws for the United States of America. It was crafted in 1787 by a convention in Philadelphia originally tasked only with amending the existing <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi>, which had loosely combined the states under a weak central government. Delegates chose to set aside the articles entirely and create a stronger federal government made of three branches: the legislative (comprising two separate parts, the House of Representatives and the Senate), the judicial (led by the Supreme Court), and the executive (headed by the President of the United States). The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> sought to carefully balance competing interests regarding state and national authority, as well as large and small state representation. It also created a more direct relationship between Americans and the national government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P1'>The convention’s departure from its original mandate to amend the <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi> generated controversy, particularly among Americans who opposed placing a distant central authority of the states. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters advocated the need for a stronger national government and explained that the federal system preserved state authority for most local matters. To guarantee enough support for ratification, the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters agreed to add an addendum to more directly protect individuals' specific rights and freedoms. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 and the new United States government began in early 1789. Shortly afterwards, the new Congress adopted several amendments to the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>, ten of which were ratified by three-fourths of the states and became known as the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments guaranteed certain rights for American citizens. Since then, seventeen additional amendments have been ratified to the United States Constitution. Three of them—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments—were adopted between 1865 and 1870, during the Reconstruction Era. The Thirteenth Amendment formally abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment provides equal protection for all laws and the Fifteenth Amendment protects voting rights for American citizens regardless of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” both specifically to combat racial discrimination against African Americans following the end of slavery.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P0'>When the Civil War began in 1861, the United States Army did not allow African American volunteers to enlist. In July of 1862, however, Congress passed the Confiscation Act, which freed the slaves of people in rebellion against the United States, and then passed the Militia Act, which authorized President Abraham Lincoln to accept African Americans into military service. Lincoln did not immediately change the policy of enlisting only white soldiers, partially due to concern that such action would inflame tensions within the tenuously loyal Border States. However, that same summer, some Union officers independently saw opportunities to recruit liberated Southern slaves and free Blacks to enlarge their understrength military forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P1'>The first Black regiments were raised by General David Hunter in the Union-controlled coastal area of South Carolina in the summer of 1862. Although that effort eventually ended after a few weeks, additional Black regiments emerged in Kansas the same year to assist in guarding that state’s border and in Louisiana around Union-occupied New Orleans. Initially, many people believed these African American units would be used for manual labor and menial tasks, such as digging trenches and guarding supply trains, thereby releasing white units from those duties in order to fight. However, the great need for combat troops meant that Black soldiers were called to the front lines relatively quickly. The First Kansas Colored Infantry was the first Black unit to see combat during the Civil War, when it defeated pro-Confederate guerrillas at Island Mound, Missouri, on October 29, 1862, before the regiment had finished recruiting.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P2'>Those initial African American units were isolated and raised by local military commanders that did not have authority to change national policy. Federal policy did change on January 1, 1863, however, when Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. The act announced that all enslaved persons in Confederate areas were declared free and it authorized the United States Army to formally accept Black volunteers for military service. Lincoln described this action as one of necessity to preserve the Union. The policy to allow Black volunteers significantly boosted the military’s manpower. Over the next two years, nearly 180,000 African American men served the Union in uniform, making up almost 10% of the army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P3'>Early Black units were raised similarly to most white volunteer regiments, as in recruited and placed into organizations according to their state. Some notable examples include the First Kansas Colored Infantry, First and Second Louisiana Native Guard Regiments, and the Fifty-Fourth and Fifty-Fifth Massachusetts Infantry Regiments. However, in May 1863, the War Department established the Bureau of Colored Troops to oversee the recruiting and organization of African American soldiers. Units accepted into federal service were designated United States Colored Troops (USCT). The units were primarily commanded by white officers; however, African American soldiers served as non-commissioned officers (such as corporals and sergeants), and by the end of the war a small number of Black soldiers did attain commissions as officers. Over 93,000 USCT soldiers were recruited in Union-occupied areas of the South. The rest were recruited in northern communities, among the pre-war free Black population as well as some escaped slaves who had reached freedom in the North. Some of the early state-designated Black units were also absorbed into the federal army with new USCT designations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P4'>The United States Army’s use of African American soldiers enraged Confederates. Black men carrying firearms provoked images of slave rebellion, a great fear in Southern antebellum culture. The Confederate government passed a resolution calling for the execution of white Union officers commanding Black soldiers for inciting servile insurrection, and recommended enslavement of Black Union soldiers captured in battle. The Lincoln administration responded that African American soldiers in the U.S. Army were legitimate combatants and threatened to execute a Confederate prisoner for each soldier or officer killed under Confederate policy, and to put a Confederate soldier into hard labor for every captured African American soldier sent into slavery. Because of this response, the Confederate government backed down. However, Black Union soldiers and their white officers were still sometimes subjected to reprisals on the battlefield. Some of the most notable reports of Confederate atrocities against Black Union prisoners occurred at places like Fort Pillow in Tennessee, Poison Spring in Arkansas, and Olustee in Florida.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P5'>Black units played conspicuous roles in several battles, especially during the last twelve months of the war, receiving praise from numerous Union military officers. Overall, approximately 20% of African American soldiers died in military service during the Civil War, from combat, disease, or accidents. During the months following the Civil War, the federal government significantly downsized the military, releasing the state volunteer units from service and restructuring the permanent, regular army force to forty-five infantry regiments. Four were African American units. Although still segregated from their white counterparts, the United States Army continued to include Black units within its structure, proving that African American volunteers had earned a permanent place in the American military.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

<p corresp='TTP32549364P3' xml:id='OTP32549364P3'>I staid last night in my room and all night had a <rs ref='#S57096'>negro</rs> <rs ref='#S32002856'>sentinel</rs> with his musket marching with heavey tramp in the passage up stairs. I presume he was guarding some persons old bureau &amp; sideboard as they were the only things upstairs to be guarded. The monotony of his tramp was relieved by an occa-sional cough &amp; breaking of wind. Under these circumstances I find it impossible to stay at my house &amp; shall move to-day, &amp; therefore only wish you to get Genl <rs ref='#S58554'>O</rs>. to restore me to my house if he will do so. The <rs ref='#S32056443'>third article of the U. S. Con<add place='above'>n</add></rs> says "No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner." I protested to Col. <rs ref='#S26659'>Smith</rs> against these troops being quartered in my house.
