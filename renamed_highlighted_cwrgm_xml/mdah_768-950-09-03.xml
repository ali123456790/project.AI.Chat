                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25018171P0'>Jones S. Hamilton was a Confederate officer who later became a wealthy railroad investor and businessman in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P1'>Born on April 19, 1833, in Wilkinson County, Mississippi, Hamilton was educated in Mississippi and then graduated from Centenary College in Louisiana. He served as sheriff of Wilkinson County during the late 1850s but resigned the position to volunteer for Confederate military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He served in a Mississippi unit in the Army of Northern Virginia, eventually attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war, Hamilton settled in Jackson, Mississippi, and held various public positions, including the deputy state auditor, adjutant general in the Mississippi militia, and a state senator. Most notably, he gained fame and wealth through railroad projects and commercial enterprises. Hamilton was credited with driving much of the infrastructure and railroad development in southern Mississippi. He also became strongly associated with the convict leasing program, where his companies paid the state to use prisoners from Mississippi’s penitentiary as laborers on public works and construction projects. By the late nineteenth century, Hamilton was a millionaire.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P2'>Hamilton’s financial success and business methods drew criticism from some, and in the 1880s he became embroiled in a dispute with a newspaper editor named Roderick Gambrell. The feud led to a duel in which Hamilton killed Gambrell. He was acquitted, but the incident underscored the controversy surrounding him and contributed to perceptions like that written by the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg American</hi>, who noted that “no man connected with public affairs of Mississippi . . . had led a more eventful, and to a certain extent, checkered, career than Jones S. Hamilton.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P3'>Hamilton died on January 21, 1907. He had been married twice, first to Carolina Augusta Stewart in 1856, with whom he had two children. She died in 1861 and he later married Fannie Buck in 1877 and had five additional children. Hamilton is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS92157P0'>John M. Simonton was a Confederate officer from Mississippi during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS92157P1'>Born on June 17, 1830, in Lawrence County, Tennessee, Simonton moved to Mississippi in 1849 and operated a store in Comargo until 1857. He was elected to the Mississippi State Senate in 1859 and opposed secession following Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860. However, when the Mississippi secession convention voted to separate from the Union in January 1861, Simonton volunteered for military service and raised a company of volunteers known as the “Rifle Scouts.” The company was combined with other volunteer units to form the First Mississippi Infantry and Simonton was elected colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS92157P2'>Simonton’s most notable action during the Civil War came at Fort Donelson in February 1862, when he was praised for his command of a Confederate brigade. Captured by Ulysses S. Grant’s troops at the fort, he was paroled the following month and returned to Mississippi. He was elected to the Mississippi State Senate again in 1863, but in 1864 he received an appointment to command state military forces in the northern sector of Mississippi, where he served until the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS92157P3'>Immediately after the war, Simonton took part in the effort to quickly reconstruct the state government according to President Andrew Johnson’s lenient policies. He served in the state senate, being elected president of that body, until it was dispersed by federal authorities for Republican Reconstruction. Simonton returned to the state senate after Reconstruction, serving through the 1880s and 1890s. He also participated in the 1890 state constitutional convention. His last public position was state land commissioner in the late 1890s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS92157P4'>Simonton died on June 24, 1898, after a long illness. He was married to Ruth Potter and the couple had six children. Ruth passed away in 1881 and Simonton married Flora Porter in 1885. He is buried in Whiteside Family Cemetery in Shannon, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS76239P0'>William Samuel Patton was a politician and Confederate soldier from Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76239P1'>Born in Wayne County, Mississippi, on June 20, 1813, Patton attended LaGrange College in Georgia in the early 1830s and moved to Alabama afterwards. He became active in Alabama politics, winning election to the state legislature in 1844. Patton moved back to Mississippi in 1848 and quickly entered the political system. He was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1851, and almost immediately became speaker of the house.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76239P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Patton volunteered for Confederate service. He helped raise a company of volunteers and served in the Army of 10,000—a Mississippi militia organization of 60-day volunteers raised in the winter of 1861-1862 that saw garrison duty in Kentucky alongside the Confederate army. Afterwards, Patton was an officer in the Thirty-seventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment and ended the war at the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76239P3'>After the war, in 1865, Patton was briefly considered a candidate for governor of Mississippi, but afterwards largely stayed out of politics. He operated a hotel in Meridian, Mississippi, and was active in the Freemasons. Patton died on June 20, 1813. He was married to Frances Webb and had at least six children. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Meridian, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P0'>During the Civil War, Union and Confederate authorities operated prison camps to hold soldiers captured during combat operations between 1861 and 1865. More than 210,000 Union soldiers and more than 460,000 Confederate soldiers became prisoners of war during the conflict. Several prison camps were originally military training camps converted into holding facilities out of necessity. As the war progressed, new camps were constructed specifically to hold prisoners of war. Prison camp conditions deteriorated as large numbers of new detainees arrived, particularly after large battles, stretching existing camps beyond their intended capacities. The most notorious prisons were the Camp Sumter (more popularly known as Andersonville) in Georgia and Camp Douglas in Illinois. More than 30,000 Union prisoners (15%) died in captivity, while almost 26,000 Confederate prisoners (12%) died in Union hands.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P1'>Early in the war, Union and Confederate authorities engaged in a parole system, which typically involved exchanging prisoners. The system occasionally involved instances when direct exchanges were not possible, but officials still released prisoners of war under oath to not take up arms again until the opposing governments had processed a legal exchange at a later date. Parolees guilty of violating the conditions of their release were subject to execution. One notable example of widespread parole was Ulysses S. Grant’s release of thousands of Confederate prisoners captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. This parole system was common in European warfare, but was most often used due to practical limitations of field armies detaining large numbers of prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P2'>The parole system broke down in 1863 when the Confederate government refused to recognize African American Union soldiers as legitimate combatants. Additionally, Union officials recognized that the Confederacy, with its smaller pool of manpower, benefitted more from the parole system than the Union. As a result, the parole system almost entirely ceased in 1864 and the numbers of prisoners of war held in camps in the Union and Confederacy increased significantly. It resumed in early 1865, when the Confederate war effort was collapsing. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62915P0'>Operating at the state level, the Mississippi State Legislature (originally called the "General Assembly") was established by Article 4 of the Mississippi Constitution on November 1, 1890, and serves as the legislative branch of the state government. It is comprised of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Legislature is responsible for passing new statewide laws and making amendments to the Constitution. (Wikipedia)
