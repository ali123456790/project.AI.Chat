                    <p xml:id='OTPS103726P0'>Thomas Sanford Gathright was a teacher, school administrator, and superintendent of public education in Mississippi, who later served as president of the state Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (modern-day Texas A&amp;M University).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS103726P1'>Born in Monroe County, Georgia, on January 5, 1829, Gathright moved to Alabama as a child and attended private school. He became a teacher in Alabama at the age of 21 and moved to Gholson, Mississippi, in 1853 to run the Summerville Institute. The school proved successful and when the Civil War broke out in 1861, it was the only secondary school that continued running in Mississippi during the war, in part since Gathright had requested exemption from state and Confederate military conscription due to health problems.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS103726P2'>Gathright remained at Summerville Institute until 1875, when the school was destroyed by fire (the second time in six years). In April 1876, he took the position of Superintendent of Public Instruction in Mississippi. He held that seat only for a short time before accepting an appointment as president of the State Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. While in this position in Texas, Gathright helped establish the Alta Vista Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas for Colored Youth, later renamed Prairie View A&amp;M University. He advocated the appointment of L. W. Minor, an African American educator from Mississippi as its first principal.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS103726P3'>Gathright left A&amp;M College of Texas in 1879 and became president of Henderson Male and Female College in Texas. He died a year later, on May 24, 1880. He was married to Sophronia Ann Prince and had at least ten children. Gathright is buried in Old Henderson City Cemetery in Henderson, Texas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32083641P0'>The first newspaper published in Mississippi was the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi Gazette</hi>, which went into print around 1800 in Natchez, before Mississippi Territory was formally organized. Several more appeared during the next few years, and by the time Mississippi entered the Union in 1817 at least half a dozen different publications had emerged. Over the following years, newspaper companies opened as communities grew and the demand for information increased. Publishing resources (like paper and print presses) became more available aiding in the news media boom. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Mississippi towns or counties had a local newspaper, published daily or weekly. Major cities typically had more than one newspaper, often published by competing political parties. Most newspapers went out of business after only a few years; however, a few continued in print for decades, including <hi rend='italic'>The Columbus Democrat</hi> in Columbus (1836–1877), <hi rend='italic'>The Kosciusko Chronicle</hi> in Kosciusko (1846–1892), and the <hi rend='italic'>Grenada Sentinel</hi> of Grenada which started in 1868 and remained in publication until 1955. Overall, as many as two hundred different publishers started daily or weekly newspapers in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P0'>Mississippi historically lagged behind most American states when it came to public education. Although some individuals, including territorial governor W. C. C. Claiborne in 1802, advocated for public education during its earliest territorial days, most officials within Mississippi territory did not endorse a broad system of public schools. The territorial legislature did establish Jefferson College, but made no effort to provide free education to Mississippi children. During the early nineteenth century, most Mississippi children received instruction at home. Some families pooled their resources or were able to direct town funds to pay for local schools, which became the earliest public schools in the state. In 1830, only thirteen percent of Mississippi children attended public schools. Families with more money sent their children to private schools, and the wealthiest often chose to send their children to secondary schools or universities in the north due to the quality of the programs there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P1'>Several small colleges emerged in Mississippi during the nineteenth century, including some women’s colleges. Some of these programs tailored the curriculum to courses seen as appropriate for females in society. This meant heavy emphasis on domestic interests and arts. However, a few of the women’s academies offered a more traditional university course load, including Whitworth College, whose president argued that women were as capable of handling the same intellectual and technical pursuits as men.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P2'>The Civil War substantially changed public education in Mississippi. The conflict interrupted most Mississippi schools and universities, but federal intervention in Mississippi political and social events after the war led to new emphasis in public schools. Northern Republicans and philanthropic volunteers in Mississippi sought to integrate former slaves into Mississippi society and opened free schools for children, regardless of race. The Mississippi constitution of 1868 directed that the state government provide a public school system funded by taxes for Mississippians between the ages of five and twenty-one. The Reconstruction legislature founded the black land-grant college in the country, Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P3'>The end of Reconstruction led to a downturn in public education across Mississippi. As conservative white southerners regained control of state politics, funding for African American education programs dwindled, and by the 1890s the state formally segregated schools. The Mississippi school system remained segregated well into the twentieth century. Educational support for white children was not a priority for state officials either, and Mississippi did not require school attendance for children until 1918, making it the last state in the United States to enact such law.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94405P0'>Established in 1845 near Shuqualak, Mississippi, Summerville Institute was a private boys boarding school. In 1854, Thomas S. Gathright became principal of the school, helping build its prestige within the state over the next several years. The institute was the only secondary school to remain in full operation during the Civil War. A fire damaged the school in 1869, but it was rebuilt, only to completely burn down in another fire in 1875. The institute did not recover from this second fire. However, due to the school’s popular reputation, the school’s principal, Gathright, became Superintendent of Public Instruction in Mississippi in April 1876, and then was appointed president of the new State Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas only a few months later.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD58310P0'>The status of "orphan" is defined in the United States as "a minor bereft through death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by, or separation or loss from, both parents" (Wikipedia). CWRGM also applies this term to identify military orphans, or a child whose mother is still living but whose father died in military service. Orphans in the nineteenth-century often came from a variety of backgrounds and had an equal variety of experiences. While the death of both parents, usually from disease, certainly left many children orphaned, poverty remained the primary cause by which a child could be sent to live at an orphanage. The rise of industrialism in the U. S. brought about a concurrent rise in poverty, particularly in the nation's cities. Many impoverished parents either abandoned their children at orphanages or asked that orphanages take in their children to provide them with the food, shelter, medicine, and in certain cases education that working-class parents could not. Children could spend months or years in orphanages, though many forced them to return to their families or go out on their own by age 15 or 16. Most orphanages were privately owned and operated by religious or reform organizations, though some states increasingly sponsored institutional homes for orphans by the end of the nineteenth century. While the vast majority of orphanages operated in major eastern cities, the so-called "orphan train" process sent orphans by train to rural areas of the country, where reformers thought that family life and agricultural work would keep them from the moral corruption of the city. Orphans of different races, religions, and ethnicities also experienced orphanages differently, as many excluded non-white, immigrant, and Jewish orphans. Ultimately, the devastation of the Civil War and the widespread poverty of industrialism in the U. S. produced an unprecedented number of orphans, and their care became a principal cause among reformers throughout the nineteenth century (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 454-6).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

Much has been said of this gentleman in connection with the office of Repre-sentative of this district in our next <rs ref='#S54079'>Con-gress</rs>, and his friends would be delighted to see him in the field. He has declined on the ground, that, in taking this step, he must neglect duties of a most weighty character, and sacrifice the usefulness of the <rs ref='#S94405'>Institution</rs> of which he is the head.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549423P2' xml:id='OTP32549423P2'>Mr. Gathright, we hope, will not find like objections to becoming a candidate for a seat in the State Senate, where, it is our opinion, his abilities may be of the most signal benefit to us. We know of no man who is more likely than he to bring to a state of some consistence a plan for the education of the numerous <rs ref='#S96659'>indigent</rs> and <rs ref='#S58310'>fatherless children</rs> of our State—a subject that has filled us all with anxiety, and one which demands legislation.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549423P3' xml:id='OTP32549423P3'>The practice of alternating between Winston and Noxubee, which was intro-duced in the days of demagogues to sub-serve party purposes, need scarcely be mentioned. Winston will readily recog-nize advantages in the <rs ref='#S95151'>election</rs> of Mr. Gathright which will outweigh any ling-ering desire she may have to follow a custom that has often called on the people to abandon their interests and the best man, for the sake of consistency—a political phrase generally inconsistent with common sense.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549423P4' xml:id='OTP32549423P4'>In consideration of these facts, we say to Mr. Gathright, come forth and allow us to elect you to the State Senate. We need your services, and the State needs them.

<p corresp='TTP32549423P6' xml:id='OTP32549423P6'>DEAR SIR:—In your paper of the 15th inst., there is a call from "Shuqua-lak" upon me to stand for the position of State Senator from the district composed of the counties Noxubee and Winston. Gentlemen from both counties have as-sured me that the desire for me to run is<lb/>
<hr/><lb/>
general, and that there will probably be no opposition; but if there is, that the people wish me to run and will elect me. I had declined a candidacy for Congress tendered me by numerous gentlemen in the district, in a manner extremely grate-ful to me; and answered them that my professional duties must not be neglected. I can continue my business and serve the people in the Senate. Please an-nounce my name as a candidate.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549423P7' xml:id='OTP32549423P7'>Before closing this note, I desire to make my acknowledgments to the peo-ple of Shuqualak for the handsome call they publicly made upon me, and for the complimentary terms in which it is ex-pressed. Shuqualak has always been kind to me, and I thank her people for it. To those gentlemen who have men-tioned my name in connection with Con-gressional honors, I am very grateful, and beg them to believe it.

FELLOW-CITIZENS:—It will be seen from the above correspondence that I am a candidate for the position of State Sen-ator for the district composed of the counties of Noxubee and Winston. When first approached on the subject, I at once replied that according to usage Winston county was entitled to the Senator, and that I could not run. Numerous gentle-men came to me and assured me that the practice of alternating between the two counties was adopted in the past to se-cure the harmony and success of party; that the district as such never recognized any such a thing, and claims, as does a Congressional district, the right to call for the services of any citizen, no matter in what county he may reside. I en-dorse the doctrine, and am a candidate to represent both counties alike.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549423P10' xml:id='OTP32549423P10'>When the proper time comes, I shall address my fellow-citizens fully on all subjects of moment, and shall not hesi-tate to declare unreservedly my senti-ments concerning the public situation.
