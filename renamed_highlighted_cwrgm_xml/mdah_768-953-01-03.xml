                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32028070P0'>Charles Albert Brougher served as Mississippi’s secretary of state in the 1860s. Born on June 19, 1824, in Morgan County, Alabama, Brougher moved to Mississippi at a young age, as his father entered politics there, serving in the Mississippi Senate in the early 1840s. Brougher graduated from Pennsylvania College (modern-day Gettysburg College) in 1846 and initially went into teaching. He then took up the study of law, and became a practicing attorney in Ripley, Mississippi in 1852.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028070P1'>In 1858, Brougher was elected Clerk of Mississippi’s House of Representatives. In 1860, he was appointed Mississippi’s secretary of state, to fill the vacancy created when B. R. Webb died in that office only six days into his first term. Brougher remained in that position through the secession crisis and first two years of the Civil War. He won reelection in 1863, and only left the secretary of state’s office when Union authorities took civil control of Mississippi in June 1865. Brougher was elected to the seat again in October 1865 and served until 1869. Brougher died on November 25, 1891. He was married to Marie Louise Earle and had seven children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32043020P0'>In August 1865, the provisional government of Mississippi held a convention to amend the state’s constitution according to federal Reconstruction policies. Delegates were required to have Unionist credentials or have sworn an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and the emancipation of enslaved people, as directed by President Andrew Johnson. Mississippi’s convention was the first among former Confederate states to meet under Johnson’s Reconstruction plan. The convention debated numerous changes to the state constitution, but most importantly recognized the abolition of slavery and declared the state’s previous secession ordinances to be null and void. The convention adjourned after a ten-day session, hopeful that the careful adjustments to Mississippi’s constitution would appease the Johnson administration and hasten the end of federal control of the state government. Northern and Southern conservatives celebrated the convention’s actions, arguing that it established President Johnson’s Reconstruction plan as the path forward for all former Confederate states. Radical Republicans, however, protested that the Mississippi convention did not protect any political rights of former slaves. Indeed, only a few months later, the new state legislature, elected under this revised constitution, passed a series of harsh restrictions against African American rights. Those policies became known as the Black Codes, and served as a model for discriminatory laws against African Americans in other Southern states over the next several months.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P0'>The United States <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 as the foundational code of laws for the United States of America. It was crafted in 1787 by a convention in Philadelphia originally tasked only with amending the existing <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi>, which had loosely combined the states under a weak central government. Delegates chose to set aside the articles entirely and create a stronger federal government made of three branches: the legislative (comprising two separate parts, the House of Representatives and the Senate), the judicial (led by the Supreme Court), and the executive (headed by the President of the United States). The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> sought to carefully balance competing interests regarding state and national authority, as well as large and small state representation. It also created a more direct relationship between Americans and the national government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P1'>The convention’s departure from its original mandate to amend the <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi> generated controversy, particularly among Americans who opposed placing a distant central authority of the states. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters advocated the need for a stronger national government and explained that the federal system preserved state authority for most local matters. To guarantee enough support for ratification, the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters agreed to add an addendum to more directly protect individuals' specific rights and freedoms. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 and the new United States government began in early 1789. Shortly afterwards, the new Congress adopted several amendments to the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>, ten of which were ratified by three-fourths of the states and became known as the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments guaranteed certain rights for American citizens. Since then, seventeen additional amendments have been ratified to the United States Constitution. Three of them—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments—were adopted between 1865 and 1870, during the Reconstruction Era. The Thirteenth Amendment formally abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment provides equal protection for all laws and the Fifteenth Amendment protects voting rights for American citizens regardless of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” both specifically to combat racial discrimination against African Americans following the end of slavery.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
