                    <p xml:id='OTPS25011848P0'>William Tecumseh Sherman was a Union general most famous for capturing Atlanta, Georgia, and conducting a military campaign across Georgia, helping bringing an end to the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P1'>Born on February 8, 1820, in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman was the son of a large and prestigious family. However, his father died suddenly in 1829, leading to Sherman and his siblings being sent to live with friends and family. Sherman moved in with Thomas Ewing, who later became a United States senator. Ewing helped Sherman receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1840 and saw service in Florida during the Seminole Wars.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P2'>Sherman was sent to California during the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s and missed the field experience and promotions many of his military colleagues enjoyed during campaigns in Mexico. He married Ellen Boyle Ewing, one Ewing’s daughters, in 1850. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage. He remained in military service in California until 1853, when he resigned and went into banking. He proved moderately successful, but left California in the late 1850s and moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, to work as an office manager in a law firm operated by two of his wife’s brothers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P3'>In 1859, Sherman received an offer to be superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning &amp; Military Academy in Pineville, Louisiana. (The school would later become Louisiana State University.) He proved to be an effective teacher and school administrator, and was popular among students and faculty. However, when the Civil War broke out in 1861, Sherman resigned from the position and traveled north to volunteer for Union military service. He was commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S. Infantry Regiment, and then placed in command of a brigade of volunteers in Virginia. He led the brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The battle was an embarrassing defeat for the Union Army, but Sherman performed well and was promoted to brigadier general. He was sent to Kentucky to assist federal military operations in the west.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P4'>While in Kentucky, Sherman expressed his belief that the conflict would be long and bloody. He received criticism for this unpopular opinion, although he was later proven entirely correct. In late 1861, Sherman began to suffer from depression, contemplating suicide, and resigned from his position in Kentucky. After recuperating for several weeks, he returned to service in December 1861 and was placed in charge of logistical operations in the Department of the Mississippi. In that role he supported Ulysses S. Grant’s successful capture of Fort Donelson, and was so impressed by the victory that he requested to serve under Grant, despite technically having higher seniority in rank. In March 1862, the War Department granted Sherman’s wish and was given command of a division within Grant’s Army of West Tennessee, helping establish one of the most effective partnerships in U.S. military history.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P5'>Only a month later, in April 1862, Sherman’s division was overrun by Confederate troops under Albert Sidney Johnston during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh. Sherman rallied many of his soldiers and, alongside Grant, the next day counterattacked and pushed the southern troops back to win the battle. Sherman was wounded twice at Shiloh, and had three horses shot from under him. Grant was impressed with Sherman’s performance, and the War Department promoted him to major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P6'>Over the next two years, Sherman became one of Grant’s most trusted subordinates, leading part of Grant’s army during the Vicksburg campaign and during engagements around Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1863. In the spring of 1864, when Grant received promotion as overall commander of Union armies, Sherman was placed in command of federal troops in the western theater. Grant relocated to Virginia to lead Union forces against Robert E. Lee’s famed Army of Northern Virginia while Sherman crafted a plan to drive an army into the heart of the Confederacy. In early 1864, he launched a campaign from Chattanooga to capture the major industrial city of Atlanta. Over the course of several weeks, he commanded three Union armies in a coordinated advance against Confederate forces under Joseph E. Johnston. Sherman captured Atlanta in September 1864, strongly boosting northern morale and aiding to Abraham Lincoln’s reelection in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P7'>Following his capture of Atlanta, Sherman embarked on an even bolder campaign. Leaving two of his three armies to watch a Confederate army under John Bell Hood in Tennessee, Sherman personally took command of his third army and ordered it to march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah. The effort involved a great deal of risk, as it saw Sherman’s army cut off from other Union forces, with no base of supply or reinforcements. With 60,000 soldiers, Sherman advanced across Georgia, destroying buildings, burning crops, and generally bringing destruction to southern communities not yet exposed to the realities of war. His army killed relatively few people compared to that seen in other Civil War campaigns, as southern commanders could not field a sufficient force in Georgia to attack the federals in force. However, the psychological effect was monumental, and his capture of Savannah on December 21, 1864, electrified the north and convinced many southerners that the Confederacy was doomed.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P8'>After reaching Savannah, Sherman turned his army northward and marched through South Carolina, the first state to secede. His troops again burned buildings and crops on his way to Columbia. They captured the city on February 17, 1865, and the city burned that night and the next day. While many blamed Sherman’s Union soldiers for destroying South Carolina’s capital out of vengeance, some of the fires may have been caused by Confederate soldiers trying to destroy large stores of cotton before abandoning the city. Sherman then continued northward into North Carolina and defeated Joseph E. Johnston’s army shortly after Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P9'>Despite his reputation for destruction during the war, Sherman held no animosity toward former Confederates. In fact, his initial terms of surrender to Confederate forces in North Carolina were considered too lenient and were overruled by federal officials, who were especially enraged by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln only days earlier.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P10'>After the war, Sherman remained in the army and was promoted to lieutenant general. During the late 1860s, he oversaw U.S. military operations in the west against Native Americans. In 1869, after Grant won election as president of the United States, Sherman was promoted to full general and made Commanding General of the United States Army. He remained in that position until 1883. Three years before he retired, during a speech to a large crowd in Columbus, Ohio, Sherman stated, “There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.” Within months, the line had become immortalized as “War is hell.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P11'>Sherman spent his last years in New York City, attending social events and entertaining guests and notable public figures. Among the people he routinely conversed with was his former enemy, Joseph E. Johnston. The two ex-generals highly respected each other. Sherman was briefly considered as a candidate for president in 1884, but stated that he would refuse to serve in that office even if elected.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P12'>Sherman died on February 14, 1891, at the age of 71. Joseph E. Johnston attended a large funeral for Sherman in New York as an honorary pallbearer, and stood in the cold rain without a hat out of respect. When cautioned that he should cover up to prevent getting sick, Johnston reportedly said, “If I were in [Sherman’s] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat.” Johnston in fact did become sick shortly after Sherman’s funeral and passed away from pneumonia a few weeks later. Sherman's remains were transported to Missouri for final interment. Today he is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94773P0'>Leonidas Polk was a bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana and a Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P1'>Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on April 10, 1806, Polk was raised and educated in North Carolina. He spent two years at the University of North Carolina before transferring to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While at West Point, Polk joined the Episcopal Church. He graduated from the military academy in July 1827 and received a commission as a U.S. Army artillery officer. Polk resigned from the army in December 1827 and entered the Virginia Theological Seminary. In 1830, shortly before he completed his religious training, he married Frances Ann Devereux. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P2'>In 1831, Pok was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal Church in 1831. The following year Polk and his wife moved to Maury County, Tennessee. He served as a priest in Columbia. During the 1830s, Polk’s personal finances grew, and he became a prominent slaveowner. By 1840, he owned 111 slaves, and by 1850 he reportedly had 400 enslaved people. In 1841, Polk was elected Bishop of Louisiana. His public standing and great wealth made him a prominent public figure outside of the church. He helped establish the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, intended to be a world-class center of higher learning for the southern, slaveholding states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P3'>In 1861, when the southern states seceded from the Union, Polk oversaw the creation of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. He wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis—a West Point classmate—to offer his services and received a commission as major general in the Confederate Army. Placed in charge of Confederate troops between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers, Polk tried to draw the neutral state of Kentucky into the Confederacy. He sent Confederate units into that state. The maneuver was a major strategic blunder, as the Kentucky legislature reacted with hostility and requested support from the Union to repel the Confederate “invaders.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P4'>Polk clashed with other Confederate generals, including his superior officer, General Albert Sidney Johnston, and submitted his letter of resignation to Jefferson Davis in November 1861. Davis rejected the resignation and Polk retained a field command. He led troops in battle against Ulysses S. Grant at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861, scoring a moral victory by repulsing Grant’s attack. However, a few days later, Polk was seriously wounded when a cannon nicknamed “Lady Polk,” in honor of his wife, exploded during a firing demonstration. He spent several weeks convalescing.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P5'>Polk returned to command in early 1862, leading Confederate soldiers at the battles of Shiloh, Perryville, and Murfreesboro. His performance during these engagements proved his bravery (helping him attain the rank of lieutenant general in October 1862), but also revealed weaknesses in handling logistics and strategy. Most significantly, he continued to engage in rivalries with other officers. He lobbied his friend Jefferson Davis to relieve General Braxton Bragg from command in the west; Bragg in return told Davis that Polk was unwilling to follow orders.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P6'>In the face of the high profile dispute between Bragg and Polk, in late 1863 Davis placed Polk in command of Confederate soldiers in Mississippi. The state was already partially under Union control—Vicksburg having been captured by Grant in July 1863, and the capital city of Jackson having been sacked by William Tecumseh Sherman—and Polk struggled to resist Union periodic federal raids against key Mississippi towns. Then, in May 1864, Polk received orders to join General Joseph E. Johnston in northern Georgia to repel Sherman’s advance to Atlanta. Polk was placed in command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P7'>On June 14, 1864, near Marietta, Georgia, Polk and several other high ranking Confederate officers found a good vantage point on Pine Mountain to observe Union forces. General Sherman noticed the group of Confederates through field glass. He ordered nearby Union artillery to fire on them. A battery from the First Ohio Light Artillery fired at the Confederate officers. One shell landed close by, startling the Confederates, who then began to disperse. A second shell struck Polk directly, passing through his chest from side-to-side, nearly cutting him in half.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94773P8'>Despite the controversies surrounding Polk as a Confederate general, he was very popular among Confederate troops. His death was widely mourned within the Confederacy. He was initially buried in Saint Paul’s Church in Augusta, Georgia. However, his remains were moved to Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1945.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32004263P0'>Stephen Dill Lee was a Confederate general and president of Mississippi State University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P1'>Born on September 22, 1833, in Charleston, South Carolina, Lee was raised and educated in the south until he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1850 and graduated in 1854. He served in the United States Army for the rest of the 1850s, with assignments in Florida, Kansas, and Dakota Territory. Lee served as a quartermaster (supply officer) during most of his assignments. When southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Lee resigned his commission and joined the Confederate cause. His first appointment, in March 1861, was as assistant adjutant general and assistant inspector general for southern forces at Charleston, South Carolina. In April 1861, he was appointed an aid to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, commander of Confederate forces at Charleston. Lee delivered Beauregard’s message to Major Robert Anderson, commander of federal troops at Fort Sumter, demanding his surrender. The subsequent Confederate bombardment and capture of the fort sparked the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P2'>Lee remained in South Carolina for most of 1861. He then received command of an artillery battery in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1862 and appointed an artillery officer in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed admirably during battles near Richmond, Virginia, in the spring of 1862. Lee was promoted and, despite a brief stint as commander of a Virginia cavalry regiment, continued to be one of the Confederacy’s best artillery officers. He fought at the Battle of Second Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, in August 1862, and played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Antietam, when his cannons engaged in heavy combat near the Dunker Church.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P3'>Following Antietam, Confederate officials promoted Lee to brigadier general and sent him to Mississippi to command of an infantry division. In late December 1862, Lee’s division held off an attack by Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman at Chickasaw Bayou, Mississippi. He took command of a Confederate brigade in January 1863, but was again called to artillery service in May 1863, when he was placed in charge of the Confederate artillery defending Vicksburg, Mississippi. His performance at the Battle of Champion Hill garnered praise, but Lee and the rest of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton’s Confederate soldiers were soon surrounded by Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army at Vicksburg and captured.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P4'>Lee was paroled by Union troops and was not allowed to return to service until formally exchanged by federal and Confederate officials. While on parole, he was promoted to major general. Released from parole in October 1863, Lee took command of cavalry troops within the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana. In May 1864, Lee was placed in overall command of the department. Confederates within his command, led by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, were victorious at the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads on June 10, 1864, but suffered a defeat at Tupelo the following month, this time with Lee on the field.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P5'>On June 23, 1864, Lee was promoted to lieutenant general. He was 30 years old, making him the youngest lieutenant general in the Confederate army. On July 26, 1864, he was given command of a corps in General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, then battling William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army near Atlanta, Georgia. He fought in numerous battles in the Atlanta area, and then during Hood’s campaign into Tennessee, sustaining wounds at least two different times.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P6'>After recovering from a wound he suffered in December 1864 near Nashville, Lee was assigned to General Joseph E. Johnston’s army in the Carolinas. He fought during the final campaign in North Carolina, surrendering in April 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P7'>After the war, Lee moved to Columbus, Mississippi, with his wife Regina Harrison, whom he had married in February 1865 while recovering from his wound. The couple settled on a large plantation given to them by Regina’s father and had one child. Lee struggled to make the plantation financially successful. He turned to the study of agriculture, and became a strong proponent of education. Lee briefly served in the Mississippi State Senate in the late 1870s and then helped found the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (present-day Mississippi State University). In 1880 became the school’s first president, remaining in that role until 1899. Lee kept an interest in state politics, serving as a delegate in Mississippi’s Constitutional Convention in 1890, which disenfranchised thousands of Black voters and more firmly entrenched white supremacy in Mississippi society.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32004263P8'>Lee was active in promoting the preservation of Civil War history, serving as president of the Mississippi Historical Society and president of the Vicksburg National Military Park Association. He helped organize veteran reunions, and wrote several articles about the Civil War. In 1908, he fell sick after giving a speech in Vicksburg to visiting Union veterans. He passed away on May 28, 1908. Lee is buried in Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63300P0'>William Wirt Adams was a Mississippi state legislator and general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P1'>Born on March 22, 1819, in Frankfort, Kentucky, Adams moved as a child with his family to Natchez, Mississippi. He graduated from Bardstown College in Kentucky in 1839 and shortly afterwards traveled to the Republic of Texas. He volunteered for military service in Texas, participating in campaigns against Native Americans. Adams later returned to Mississippi, married Sarah Huger Mayarant in 1850, and became a successful businessman in Jackson and Vicksburg. The couple had five children over the next few years, and in 1858, Adams won a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives, serving two terms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P2'>When Mississippi seceded from the Union in January 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Adams received an appointment as state commissioner to Louisiana to help facilitate that state’s separation from the Union. In February 1861, Adams received an invitation from the Confederate States of America’s president, Jefferson Davis, to serve as Confederate Postmaster General, but he turned the offer down. Instead, Adams raised a cavalry regiment in Mississippi. Accepted into Confederate service in August 1861, Adams led his regiment in several engagements over the next several months, including Shiloh and Corinth. During Ulysses S. Grant’s campaign to capture Vicksburg, Adams’ regiment conducted patrols, scouted Union activities, and guarded key locations in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P3'>Adams received a promotion to brigadier general in September 1863. He commanded Confederate troops during engagements at Port Hudson and Baton Rouge, and unsuccessfully tried to stop William Tecumseh Sherman’s campaign to Meridian, Mississippi, in February 1864. Adams did score a moral victory when he and his men captured a Union gunboat, USS <hi rend='italic'>Petrel</hi>, on the Yazoo River. The Confederate soldiers carried away eight naval guns and then burned the ship. During the latter part of the war, Adams served alongside famed Confederate cavalry commander Nathan Bedford Forrest in Alabama, before surrendering to Union troops in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P4'>Following the Civil War, Adams returned to Mississippi. He variously stayed in Vicksburg and Jackson. In 1880 he received an appointment as a state revenue agent; five years later he accepted an appointment as postmaster in Jackson by President Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P5'>During the late 1880s, Adams became embroiled in a personal dispute with John H. Martin, the editor of the <hi rend='italic'>New Mississippian</hi>. On May 1, 1888, the two men encountered each other on a street in Jackson. The two men began arguing and then each pulled pistols and fired. Both men died at the scene. Adams is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32002213P0'>Dabney Herndon Maury was a West Point instructor, military textbook author, and Confederate general. Born on May 21, 1822, in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Maury was raised by his uncle Matthew Fontaine Maury (an oceanography and naval meteorology expert) after his father, a naval officer, died in the West Indies. Maury attended the University of Virginia before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1846 and was commissioned an officer in a mounted regiment. Badly wounded in the arm during the Mexican-American War, Maury was promoted for bravery and sent home to Virginia to recuperate. After recovering from his wound, Maury was appointed an instructor at West Point, where he served from 1847 until 1852. During the 1850s, Maury returned to field service and carried out various assignments in Pacific Northwest and Texas. In the late 1850s, he was stationed at the Cavalry School at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, where he wrote <hi rend='italic'>Tactics for Mounted Rifles</hi>, which became a standard training manual for the U.S. Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P1'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Maury was in New Mexico Territory serving as assistant adjutant general. He resigned from the U.S. Army and returned to Virginia to volunteer for Confederate service. He received an appointment as a colonel and eventually became chief of staff under General Earl Van Dorn in the Trans-Mississippi region. Following Van Dorn’s loss at Pea Ridge, Maury was promoted to brigadier general and given command of a division. He led troops at the Second Battle of Corinth in October 1862, and was again promoted (to major general) the following month. Maury participated in various operations in Mississippi and Alabama. During the last two years of the war he commanded the Department of the Gulf and performed well in the defense of Mobile.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P2'>At the end of the Civil War, Maury returned to Virginia and founded a school in Fredericksburg. He later pursued a business venture in New Orleans, but the effort failed and Maury struggled financially. He had much greater success as an academic, founding the Southern Historical Society in 1869 and providing many of his own writings on southern history. While articles by former Confederates published by the historical society helped establish Lost Cause mythology (the effort to celebrate the Confederacy and separate the institution of slavery from the cause of the war), Maury did not use his writings to self-promote or attack rivals. His publications were appreciated by former Confederates and former Union officers as being fair and well written. His book <hi rend='italic'>Recollections of a Virginian in the Mexican, Indian, and Civil Wars</hi>, published in 1894, received wide praise for its candor and humor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P3'>Maury maintained an interest in military training, lobbying in the 1870s to reorganize a national militia and the authoring the book <hi rend='italic'>Skirmish Drill for Mounted Troops</hi> in 1886. He also received an appointment as U.S. minister to Colombia from President Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32002213P4'>Maury was married to Nannie Rose Mason. He had five children. Maury died on January 11, 1900, in Peoria, Illinois, at his son’s house. He is buried at Confederate Cemetery in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS84072P0'>Absolom Madden West was a Confederate general, a Mississippi politician, railroad executive, and vice presidential candidate. Born in Alabama in 1818, West moved to Mississippi around 1837 to establish a plantation with property he acquired from federal land grants. He entered Mississippi state politics as a Whig and won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1847. He married Caroline O. Glover in the 1840s and the couple had four surviving children, born between 1849 and 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P1'>In 1853, he took an office job with the new Mississippi Central Railroad, gaining experience not only in railroad development but corporate and logistical operations. As a Whig, West originally opposed secession. However, after Mississippi left the Union in 1861, during the secession crisis that split the country following Abraham Lincon’s election to president in November 1860, West offered his loyalty and services to the state. He was promoted a brigadier general in the Mississippi state militia, and helped raised a regiment of volunteers. Recognizing his skill and experience in administrative and logistical work, state officials appointed him to several different managerial roles, such as quartermaster general, paymaster general, and commissary general of the militia. He made recommendations to the state legislature to improve the accounting of funds, and was the only state officer to have his accounting books in order and submitted at the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P2'>West took the role of president over the Mississippi Central Railroad around 1864. He remained in that position until around the end of the war, then returned to state politics—again serving in the Mississippi Senate—after the Illinois Central purchased the Mississippi Central. West was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the early effort by the Mississippi government in 1865 to earn readmission to the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, he was among the Mississippi delegation refused seats in Congress when Republicans in Washington, D.C., objected to Mississippi’s “Black Codes”—a series of highly discriminatory laws passed in the summer of 1865 to restrict the civil rights of African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P3'>West became involved in labor rights during Reconstruction, helping form a branch of the National Labor Union. Reentering the Mississippi Senate in the early 1870s, around 1876 he broke away from the Democratic Party and joined the emerging “Greenback Party”—an independent, anti-monopoly political party. It united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters, namely the expansion of paper currency believed to help farmers and small businesses. Attesting to the party’s ability to bring former enemies together, the party’s national convention in 1884 nominated former Union general Benjamin Butler (who had been despised within the Confederacy during his occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War) for its presidential candidate and the former Confederate militia general West as vice president. The party polled only a 1.7% of the popular vote in 1884.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P4'>West’s wife Caroline died in 1889 after a long bout of poor health. He died five years later, in 1894.  The couple is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32028021P0'>Henry Warner Slocum was a Union general during the Civil War and a U.S. congressman from New York.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P1'>Born on September 24, 1827, in Delphi Falls, New York, he proved an intelligent and studious individual, earning a teaching certificate at the age of 16. After teaching for a few years, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1852. Slocum served for four years in the U.S. Army, participating in the Third Seminole War in Florida before resigning his commission in 1856 and moving to Syracuse, New York. He studied law for two years, and then was admitted as a practicing attorney in Syracuse in 1858. Within a year, Slocum was elected county treasurer and then was elected to the New York State Assembly.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Slocum volunteered for Union military service. He received a commission as colonel in command of the Twenty-Seventh New York Infantry Regiment. He led that unit during the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, receiving a severe wound. When he recovered enough to return to field service, Slocum was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of a brigade in the Army of the Potomac. By May 1862, he was in command of a division and led it with distinction during the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond, Virginia, receiving high praise from Union officers. In July 1862, at the age of 34, he was promoted to major general. He continued to perform well in battle, playing a conspicuous role in the Battle of South Mountain in September 1862 and the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P3'>Slocum played a vital, but somewhat unappreciated, role at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. On July 2, when ordered to relocate his XII Corps south in response to a Confederate assault on the Union left flank, Slocum wisely recognized the risk such move would cause to the Union army’s right flank at Culp’s Hill. He ordered one of his brigades to remain in defense of that position, which likely saved the Union Army from defeat at Gettysburg when that brigade repelled a massive Confederate assault upon Culp’s Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P4'>In the fall of 1863, Slocum was transferred to the western theater. He initially received command of a division tasked with protecting the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. However, in the summer of 1864, he received command of the XVII Corps in Tennessee and the District of Vicksburg. General Ulysses S. Grant was so impressed with Slocum’s management of the Vicksburg district that he wished to keep him in that position and delayed Slocum’s reassignment to field command in Georgia. Eventually, though, Slocum joined William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union force during the campaign for Atlanta, taking command of the XX Corps. He effectively led the corps during the campaign, resulting in his troops being the first to march into Atlanta when the city surrendered in. September 1864. He was then placed in charge of Union occupation forces in Atlanta for more than two months, showing compassion and efficiency in his duties.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P5'>Slocum received command of the Army of Georgia and supported Sherman’s march across Georgia to Savannah. His army did not see any major engagements during that campaign, but did see intense action in the subsequent Carolinas Campaign. When the Civil War ended in 1865, Slocum was among the most successful and respected Union generals.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P6'>Shortly after hostilities ended, Slocum resigned from the army and turned to civilian life. He unsuccessfully ran for the Secretary of State position in New York, then began a law practice. In 1868, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat and served two terms. After practicing law in the 1870s he again won a congressional seat in 1882 and served a single term. During his time in public office and as an attorney, Slocum was active in promoting infrastructure development in New York, including the construction and expansion of street cars and bridges.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P7'>Slocum died on April 14, 1894. He was married to Carolina A. Rice and had three children. Slocum is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS69502P0'>Robert Kells was a medical doctor and the superintendent of the Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS69502P1'>Born on June 19, 1819, at Claverack, New York, Kells was educated in the north and moved to Edward’s Depot, Mississippi, in 1840 where he began a medical practice. He married Mary Montgomery Phillips in 1846 and the couple received a substantial amount of land in Mississippi from Mary’s wealthy father in 1850. For a few years, Kells was a planter on the property, until he received an appointment as the superintendent of the State Lunatic Asylum in Jackson in 1859.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS69502P2'>The asylum was under investigation over practices by previous superintendents, and Kells was brought in to improve the facility. He lobbied the state legislature to expand the facility, and invited famed nurse and humanitarian Dorothea Dix to aid in his efforts. They received some promises for increased funding, but the Civil War broke out before Kells could implement substantial changes to the facility and care of the patients. Kells remained in charge of the asylum during the war, and stayed at his post when Union soldiers occupied Jackson in 1863. Most sources indicate that Kells was a capable supervisor and did well in his job despite the hardships of war in Mississippi and the lack of support and supplies. Immediately after the war, he renewed his efforts to boost funding for the asylum, but in 1865 Kells was replaced by a new appointee (reportedly selected by federal officials then occupying Mississippi).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS69502P3'>After leaving his position as supervisor of the state asylum, Kells practiced medicine in Jackson. Eventually, he returned to his plantation to again oversee planting operations. He maintained a general connection to the medical field, being a member of Mississippi’s Medical Association and the State Board of Health.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS69502P4'>Kells’ wife Mary passed away in 1871. He lived until 1888, dying of a stroke at the age of 68. Kells is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32013126P0'>In mid-July 1863, Confederate soldiers and Southern civilians evacuated Jackson, Mississippi, for the second time in the face of a Union army.  The city had been evacuated first in May 1863, when Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston, commanding several thousand soldiers in Jackson, believed his force to weak to repulse approaching Union forces from Major General Ulysses S. Grant’s Army of the Tennessee. Federal soldiers temporarily occupied the capital in mid-May, destroyed numerous buildings, and then turned westward to capture the city of Vicksburg. Johnston returned to Jackson on May 20, 1863, with his army for the purpose of relieving Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton’s Confederate garrison surrounded at Vicksburg. The city of Jackson returned to Confederate control. However, instead of moving with haste, Johnston waited near Jackson for additional military reinforcements to arrive. He moved his force to Big Black River, between Jackson and Vicksburg, but continued to delay for several weeks, believing his army was too small to directly challenge Grant’s army. When Pemberton surrendered Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, Grant turned his attention to Johnston’s army. He ordered Major General William T. Sherman to attack Johnston and retake Jackson. Over the next few days, Union troops pushed Johnston’s Confederates back, reaching the outskirts of the city on July 10. Sherman’s men besieged Jackson for nearly a week, before Johnston ordered this second withdrawal on July 16. Confederate troops and Southern civilians again evacuated Jackson. For a second time, Sherman’s soldiers occupied the city, destroying additional buildings and resources to limit the area’s value to the Confederate cause. They then departed, rejoining Grant’s main force near the Mississippi River. (Wikipedia; Mississippi History Now)

Battles are fights between armed forces, and usually describe singular events that occur over the course of hours or a few days. Skirmishes are smaller fights, usually between a small number of soldiers that occur unexpectedly, last only a few minutes or a few hours, and take place away from the main area of fighting.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P0'>When the American Civil War began in the spring of 1861, many northerners and southerners expected the conflict to be short, settled after a rapid military campaign and perhaps one great battle. When those expectations proved incorrect, Union military authorities began conducting broad offensive operations designed to capture key locations within the Confederacy. The first targets held military or political value, such as fortifications, port cities, and capitals. Union armies advancing toward those objectives began capturing pro-secessionist communities. Because federal activities in the South focused on military objectives, Union armies initially had little guidance on how to govern the Confederate areas they occupied. As a result, federal officers relied upon their own interpretation of law and their military authority. Many took a conservative approach, enacting few changes to the local community, while others governed with a heavy hand—either as punishment to secessionists or to enact their favored political policies. One such example included General John C. Frémont’s declaration of martial law and emancipation of slaves in Missouri. The order was quickly overturned by President Abraham Lincoln’s administration, but the incident revealed the varied actions that occurred in pro-secessionist areas occupied by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P1'>As the war progressed, Union armies advanced deeper into the Confederacy. Lincoln began developing plans for reconstruction and reconciliation of Union-controlled areas, but restructuring local governments was only part of the effect occupation had on Southern communities. Federal armies needed supplies. Union officers acquisitioned resources within occupied areas—sometimes with payment, other times by confiscation—to feed and support their military forces. In cases where Union troops could not maintain a permanent presence, they burned or otherwise destroyed Southern crops, buildings, and railroads to deny their use by Confederates.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P2'>Union-occupied areas of the South also saw an influx of northern businessmen anxious to capitalize on Southern resources. Since the Union navy blockaded Confederate ports and prevented exports to Europe, many Southerners had surplus supplies and limited market options. Cotton speculators shadowed Union armies—and in some cases colluded with federal military officials—to negotiate with these desperate Southern planters to send their crop north. This illicit business practice became rampant in occupied areas, prompting the War Department to establish rules for business transactions within Union lines. Illegal trade continued. In December 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant issued General Orders No. 11 in response to continued concerns about market speculation in occupied portions of the Confederacy. The order was highly controversial because it unfairly blamed the Jewish population for the problematic business practices and called for the expulsion of all Jewish citizens from his military department. The Lincoln administration immediately rescinded the order, but Grant lived with the negative effects of his discriminatory proclamation for the rest of his life. The event highlighted the tensions of market speculation and illicit trade in Union occupied areas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P3'>The most significant effect Union occupation had on Southern communities was the disruption of slavery. Enslaved African Americans fled to Union armies to escape bondage. Early in the war, Union commanders had no guiding policy for handling runaway slaves. Some returned them to their owners; others, with abolitionist principles, happily facilitated their escape north or protection behind Union lines. However, in May 1861, Union general Benjamin Butler developed a new legal approach to fugitive slaves when a small number sought refuge within his lines at Union-occupied Fort Monroe, Virginia. He refused to return them to their secessionist owner, declaring them “contraband of war”—property which could be confiscated according to laws of war. News of this policy saw widespread support across the North, as punishment to secessionists but also as a practical way to deny the Confederacy its chief source of labor. The United States Congress soon followed Butler’s actions with legislation authorizing Union armies to confiscate Confederate property and slaves. As the war continued, federal policies against slavery expanded, until Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared all slaves within Confederate areas forever free. Even with Lincoln’s hope for a quick restoration and reconciliation of the Union, occupied areas of the South were forever changed during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P4'>At the end of the war, the United States Army occupied the whole South. However, sustained occupation was not possible, especially as the War Department reduced the army by discharging hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers. The army kept troops in the south to enforce federal law—especially to protect African American rights—as former Confederates began to move back into local political offices. However, their role in Southern communities declined until 1877, when southern Democrats and Republican supporters of presidential candidate Rutherford Hayes agreed upon a plan to withdraw the last United States soldiers from the South and end Reconstruction. Federal occupation of the South, which had begun in 1861 in response to secession and the Civil War, was over. (Wikipedia; National Park Service; Army Heritage Center Foundation)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25002455P0'>The term cavalry refers to horse-mounted soldiers. Although cavalry was a fundamental part of a Civil War army, by the American Civil War, weapons and tactics limited the role cavalry soldiers played on the battlefield. Disciplined infantry soldiers in tight ranks with muskets and bayonets could repel cavalry charges. Therefore, Civil War armies used the speed and mobility of cavalry troops for scouting and raiding behind enemy lines. Additionally, cavalry soldiers could fight on foot in loose, or skirmish, formations to harass enemy positions or delay enemy attacks. Overall, because cavalry units required greater logistical support in order to feed and care for their horses, and due to their relatively limited role in open battle, cavalry units made up a much smaller part of the army than their infantry counterparts.

<p xml:id='OTPSD25002455P1'>When the Civil War began, there were five mounted regiments in the regular United States Army. During the initial call for volunteers, federal military officials did not want new cavalry units due to the higher cost and time associated to training and outfitting horse soldiers. However, as it became clear that there would be no quick end to the war, and existing cavalry units proved valuable for scouting and mobile warfare, the federal government began adding additional cavalry units to the Army. As with most infantry regiments during the Civil War, the majority of cavalry units were raised by individual states and transferred to federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25002455P2'>Union cavalry troops were largely seen as outclassed by their Confederate counterparts during the first half of the Civil War. One popular explanation for this is that United States Army cavalry troopers were supplied horses, rather than bringing their own upon enlistment (something more common in the Confederate army), and therefore were less experienced and comfortable on their mounts. Another common theory was that men who grew up in a Northern industrial society were less familiar with horses than those from the agrarian South. These explanations may have limited merit, especially within the Eastern Theater, but exaggerate the differences between North and South. United States Army cavalry troopers from mid-western and western states were also highly experienced in horsemanship before the war, and cavalry engagements in the western and Trans-Mississippi theaters did not see much disparity between United States and Confederate cavalry units.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25002455P3'>Union horse soldiers steadily earned a better reputation as the war progressed. The North’s superior supply chain provided a steady stream of equipment and horses, allowing United States cavalry units to remain well-equipped as they gained experience. The Confederacy’s early reputation of superior cavalry ended in June 1863, when Union cavalry soldiers fought Confederates to a draw at Brandy Station, the largest cavalry battle in North America. Federal cavalry forces continued to improve during the last two years of war. In 1864, Union general Philip Sheridan used his cavalry corps to conduct long range operations in Virginia, while western military commanders conducted similarly destructive cavalry raids in Mississippi and Alabama, all of which hastened end of the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD105689P0'>Founded in 1848, the Mississippi State Hospital was a state-funded institution in Jackson, Mississippi, for people suffering from psychological disorders. First proposed by Governor Albert Gallatin Brown in 1846, the initial facility was constructed on a five-acre lot with funds provided by the state legislature. Shortly afterwards, the hospital’s commissioners constructed a larger facility north of Jackson (currently the campus of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson) with guidance and support from noted humanitarian Dorothea L. Dix, who personally appealed to Mississippi legislators for better mental health treatment. (Before the nineteenth century, people with psychiatric problems were often ignored, abandoned, or jailed as public nuisances.) Named the Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum, the four-story hospital began taking patients in 1855. Originally intended for white patients, the hospital’s administrators and board of trustees began admitting a small number of African Americans—free and slave—for treatment in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P1'>The state hospital housed and treated thousands of mental health patients (often referred to as lunatics in the vernacular of the nineteenth century). The number of patients rose from 70 in 1855 to nearly 500 by 1890. Most people admitted for treatment in the 1850s were women in their 20’s and 30’s, sent by family members for causes listed as “unlucky in business,” “disappointed in love,” and “feeblemindedness.” Patients were also placed into the state hospital for behavior associated to menstruation, overactive sexual interests or activities, drug or alcohol use, and other behaviors deemed socially or religiously inappropriate. Not all patients were admitted at the behest of family members, as local citizens could file complaints against neighbors or other residents, prompting their local sheriff to detain the suspected “lunatic” and present them to a county probate court for a jury to decide if admission to the asylum was necessary.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P2'>The facility and its care for psychological disorders were considered advanced for the mid-nineteenth century and many patients were employed in jobs, such as carpentry, farming, manufacturing, and other laboring tasks on the hospital grounds. However, some treatments for psychological disorders in that era included mechanical restraints, physical punishment, and isolation. As many as 7,000 patients died at the state hospital site at Jackson between 1855 and its 1935, when the Mississippi government closed the state hospital at Jackson and opened a new facility at a different location. Some deaths were due to poorly understood sanitation or disease problems, such as tainted water supplies, as well as yellow fever and malaria epidemics, but many other deaths occurred due to the patients remaining at the facility until they died of natural causes. The hospital was seen as a permanent residence for those deemed “incurable.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P3'>During the Civil War, Union soldiers temporarily occupied the state hospital when they captured Jackson. The troops confiscated property from the facility, including killing livestock held on the hospital grounds. However, the hospital remained active during the war, and was improved in 1870 with the appointment of Dr. William Compton as superintendent. He lobbied for better funds and treatment for patients, particularly for African Americans, although the facility was segregated by race and gender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P4'>The state hospital continued to expand and treat a growing number of patients well into the twentieth century. By the mid-1920s it housed 2,000 patients. Due to its deteriorating conditions after decades of operation, the Mississippi legislature constructed a new facility in Rankin County, which opened in 1935. The Mississippi State Hospital at Jackson closed its doors that same year. (Lucius M. Lampton, “Whitfield (Mississippi State Hospital),” Mississippi Encyclopedia; Sudhakar Madakasira, “History of Mississippi Psychiatry: A Dark Past Unearthed on UMMC Grounds,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of the Mississippi Psychiatric Association</hi>)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD52163P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses advanced dramatically, though by 1900 it certainly still had far to go. In colonial America, mental illnesses were largely perceived as acts of God and thus inescapable and incurable. American society therefore dealt with people suffering from mental illnesses primarily through charitable organizations or benevolent societies like churches or almshouses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P1'>Throughout the nineteenth century, however, as the ideals of the Enlightenment continued to evolve, Americans developed a more institutional, scientific approach to understanding and treating mental illnesses as curable and in turn developing the field of psychiatry. Psychiatrists and state governments founded state-funded asylums to study and treat people with mental illnesses in isolation to prevent both interruption of treatment and danger to society. While nineteenth-century psychiatrists employed many terms no longer accepted to describe mental illnesses, and while the methods they employed in their asylums have likewise been largely dismissed, the study and treatment of mental illness in the United States advanced rapidly in the nineteenth century in tandem with greater societal and educational reforms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P2'>It is critical to note, however, that much of this advancement was aided by slavery. The Eastern Lunatic Asylum of Virginia, for example, relied on enslaved people as both patients and caregivers, and ideas about blackness and insanity were often mutually dependent. (Wendy Gonaver, The Peculiar Institution and the Making of Modern Psychiatry, 1840–1880).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P3'>One notable, and widespread, mental illness afflicting Americans in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries was the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) experienced by many Civil War veterans. While psychiatry had evolved over the century, its failure to diagnose and treat widespread PTSD glaringly reveals its limits (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 283-285).

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63339P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines marriage as “a legally accepted relationship between two people in which they live together, or the official ceremony,” CWRGM employs this subject tag whenever an author references marriage regardless of whether it was legally binding or not.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P1'>In the nineteenth century, marriage was shaped by coverture, an element of English common law dating back to the Middle Ages, which held that a married woman’s legal status fell under her husband’s. Married women could not sue or own property, including their own wages, and they did not legally have control over the lives of their children or of their own bodies. Wives were expected to manage the household or the domestic sphere. For most, these responsibilities included cooking, cleaning, and nurturing children, although elite white women in the South were also expected to manage household slaves, even violently.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P2'>Coverture, however, did not just shape the lives of women. Husbands were responsible for providing financial support for their families and for all aspects of the public sphere of life. Women, then, sometimes used the law and sentimental appeal to pressure recalcitrant husbands or even more broadly men in their communities to provide for their families. Poor white women, for example, sometimes used this argument to persuade public and private orphan institutions to accept their children, especially when their own husbands failed to live up to their roles as providers. This aspect of coverture played out most acutely in the South during the Civil War. By embracing their identities as “soldiers’ wives,” poor white women demanded that the Confederacy provide them with political protection and provide for their basic needs. In places like Richmond, Virginia, such women took to the streets in what historians call the “bread riots,” where they demanded public assistance, but their identities as dependent “wives” were central to this activism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P3'>Because marriage was a civil contract, enslaved men and women did not have these same legal protections and obligations. However, within the limitations of slavery, they married by mutual agreement, selecting their own partners in many cases, and they maintained affectionate marriages that mimicked the gender roles of the dominant culture. Men attempted to live out their roles as the heads of their families, while subordinate wives took responsibility for the domestic sphere. However, because these marriages were not legally binding and were subject to the needs and desires of the planter class, slavery made these marriages distinctive. For example, when husbands and wives had different enslavers, they were unable to cohabitate. In other cases, enslavers selected pairings based on their own whims, removing the possibility of choice. Finally, enslaved couples also recognized that marriage did not protect them from the Domestic Slave Trade. They could – and did – face separations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63339P4'>During Reconstruction, former slaveholding states were forced to pass laws that gave Black marriages the same legal protections as those of white men and women. However, this legal arm became a new way for white supremacists to control Black families. Couples who cohabited without that civil contract would be punished, and these men and women could be condemned for bigamy and adultery in cases where the slave trade had forced them to consent to multiple partners. Nevertheless, while some formerly enslaved men and women were ambivalent to legal marriage because of these punitive standards, most did embrace the opportunity for these legal protections, even seeing it as one step towards realizing full equality.

<p corresp='TTP32549474P1' xml:id='OTP32549474P1'>Our garden and field labour has again been blest with good, and many instances, with boun=tiful results. I must state to the credit of the patients, that much of this labour is performed by them. We have quite a number of chronic cases, that are in pretty good, and some in robust health, that engage in these health=ful employments. The female patients also make themselves useful in their department, and the result of their labours, spares no little expense to the Institution. All the clothing for males and females have been made up in the house, beside many other pieces, of which the number has not been kept,—for until re=cently, we have had no matron whose province it is to attend to this matter. Without entering into the minutia, we will give some of the more important results, of what has been done. We have just commenced using our sweet potatoes and I think we can safely say our crop will yield as follows<table cols='1' rows='9'><row role='label'/><row><cell role='data'> Sweet Potatoes</cell><cell role='data'>2000</cell><cell role='data'>bush </cell></row><row><cell role='data'> Irish ,,</cell><cell role='data'>500</cell><cell role='data'>,, </cell></row><row><cell role='data'> Cabbage</cell><cell role='data'>18000</cell><cell role='data'>Heads </cell></row><row><cell role='data'> Hay</cell><cell role='data'>12000</cell><cell role='data'>Pounds </cell></row><row><cell role='data'> Onions</cell><cell role='data'>50</cell><cell role='data'>bush </cell></row><row><cell role='data'> Tomatoes</cell><cell role='data'>75</cell><cell role='data'>,, </cell></row><row><cell role='data'> Garden Peas</cell><cell role='data'>30</cell><cell role='data'>,, </cell></row><row><cell role='data'> Cornfield "</cell><cell role='data'>100</cell><cell role='data'>,, </cell></row><row><cell role='data'> Beets</cell><cell role='data'>40</cell><cell role='data'>,, </cell></row></table>
