                    <p xml:id='OTPS56587P0'>James Alexander Seddon was an American congressman and then Secretary of State of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P1'>Born near Fredericksburg, Virginia, on July 13, 1815, Seddon grew up in Virginia and graduated from the University of Virginia’s law school. After working as an attorney for several years, Seddon entered politics, winning election as a Democrat to the U. S. House of Representatives in 1845. He declined to run for reelection due to a disagreement with the Democratic platform, but returned to Congress in 1849. In 1851, Seddon left public office, citing poor health, and resided in a plantation along the James River, near Richmond, Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P2'>Seddon became active in politics again in 1861, during the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency. He attended a peace conference in Washington, D.C., in February 1861, which brought together representatives from the upper southern states who wished to avoid a war over secession. However, after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina, and President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down secessionist defiance of federal authority, Virginia seceded. Seddon backed the Confederate cause and served in the Confederate Congress as a representative of Virginia. In 1862, he received an appointment by Confederate president Jefferson Davis to serve as Secretary of State for the Confederacy—the fourth man to hold the position, and ultimately being the longest serving.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56587P3'>Seddon remained secretary until January 1, 1865, then retired and returned to his home. Union soldiers arrested him in May 1865; he spent several months in prison before being released. Seddon remained out of public life following the Civil War, dying on August 19, 1880, at the age of 65. He was married to Sarah Bruce, and had nine children. Seddon is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

Robinson expanded his business ventures into other Mississippi towns, helping to form Robinson, Reynolds &amp; Company in Brandon, and Robinson, Mayson &amp; Company in Canton. Robinson was among the most successful and notable businessmen in Mississippi when he died on April 27, 1881, from pneumonia. He was married to Mary Jane Bradford and had at least four children who lived to adulthood. Robinson is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25021472P0'>John Duncan was an attorney and public figure in Mississippi during the mid-nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25021472P1'>Born to Scottish immigrant parents in 1812 in New York, Duncan moved to Grenada, Mississippi, in the 1830s and worked in a dry goods store with a brother and brother-in-law. Through his successful business dealings, he became a plantation owner, and studied law to become an attorney. He married Lucy Howell in 1856 and three children. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Duncan helped raise a company of volunteers for Confederate service—nicknamed the Duncan Riflemen in honor of his financial support for the unit—which was placed into the Forty-Fifth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He also worked alongside the Confederate government, including President Jefferson Davis, to promote cotton sales to England, and was reportedly a potential candidate for ambassador to England.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25021472P2'>Duncan worked as a business manager for several plantations, and served on the University of the South’s board of directors. He died on February 7, 1872. Duncan’s wife and three children all preceded him in death, dying of disease in 1862 and 1863. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P0'>As the American Civil War extended into its third year, the Confederate government found itself deeply indebted and unable to provide food, clothing, and other necessities for its army. On March 26, 1863, the Confederate government passed the Impressment Law. Under this law, state boards of impressment, with the assistance of local commissioners, impressed food, fuel, enslaved persons, and other commodities to support the war effort and to pay off its debts. Commissioners met with local farmers to fix prices for their commodities, subject to revision every two months. One month later, the Confederate government enacted a tax-in-kind. The tax-in-kind required farmers to donate ten percent (to be judged by a collector) of their produce in lieu of taxes paid in currency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32008490P1'>Both of these policies increased tensions between white southerners and the Confederate government. Farmers and their families often felt cheated by government agents offering far less than market value for their goods. Areas close to fighting also disproportionately experienced impressment, as Confederate armies on the ground often stripped their farms clean. The Confederacy also impressed enslaved persons to perform labor, and the brutality of that labor often resulted in the death, injury, or mistreatment of the enslaved, who, if returned at all, did so in much worse condition than they left. The Confederate government also routinely failed to pay for impressed goods and kept enslaved persons longer than their agreed impressment period. Impressment, then, led to protests among rural white southerners, some of whom hoarded their goods from collectors or impersonated collectors in order to acquire food for themselves and their families. The tax-in-kind alone garnered roughly $62 million for the Confederacy from 1863 to 1865, yet combined with impressment, these policies alienated much of the Confederacy's local support and failed to fully pay its debts or win the war.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63506P0'>Primary and secondary education in the nineteenth-century United States varied greatly by region and economic class. Prior to the Civil War and Reconstruction, the United States had no centralized educational system, relying primarily on state and even municipal authorities to ensure that students received an education. In rural areas, particularly in northeastern states prizing education as necessary to republican government, many local communities developed the earliest forms of public education known as "district schools" that taught boys and girls alike for free. In urban areas, public and private schools (also divided by religious denomination) often competed, with public schools serving lower-income students and private schools serving wealthy ones (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 1, 396).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63506P1'>After the American Revolution, girls and women were encouraged to attend schools and receive educations, yet their roles in so doing remained divided based on gender. Nineteenth century Americans viewed women's place in the home, and women's education was widely accepted as a way for them to pass that education on to their children. The nineteenth century therefore saw more opportunities for girls to become students, yet still in a discriminated way. Prior to the Civil War, most schools, though co-educational were either segregated or, in the South, completely prohibitive to African Americans. However, during Reconstruction, the Freedmen's Bureau established over 3,000 schools for African American children between 1865 and 1869 (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 1, 412). Even after the legalization of and widespread efforts at educating African Americans, education in the United States remained deeply segregated, with inferior funding and resources provided to African American schools - a system entrenched during the Jim Crow era of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Consequently, the United States, and particularly the South, was slow to adopt universal, state-sponsored primary and secondary education, and what did exist remained marred by deep divisions of race, class, and gender.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Subsequently the case was brought before the <rs ref='#S56587'>Sec-retary</rs> of <rs ref='#S99586'>War</rs>, who ordered the remainder paid, and the same was collected within a few weeks past.

It is not our purpose to comment, at this time, upon the wisdom of the Legislature, in thus introducing a foreign and independent element into an Institution, where good government and strict discipline are so essential to success; nor do we intend, just now, to speak of the apparent disregard of the existence of this Board, when, without any intimation that such a step was contemplated, an act was passed, vitally impairing its authority and destruction of the usefulness of the Institution. We wish, simply, to call your attention to the fact, that in passing this law the Hono-rable Legislature omitted to make any pecuniary appropriation to carry out its provisions—We beg again to refer to the report of the Superintendent, accompanying this communication—

<p corresp='TTP32549489P2' xml:id='OTP32549489P2'>For the first time during the administration of this Board, we find our Treasury empty, and the Institution some $<hi rend='underline'>3000</hi> in debt;—very little of this sum, we may add, is due to outsiders; yet the debt exists, and unless there should be a called session of the Legislature, we will have to wait an entire year, before we can receive additional appropriations from the State.

We have decided upon the latter; and, although opposed, in every way, to intercourse with the ene-mies of our country, we consider it due to the Institution committed to our care, to waive our personal objections, and to ask permission from the proper authorities to send Cotton to Vicksburg (Miss.)|Vicksburg]] to purchase necessary articles for pupils and em-ployees of the Institution. It is true that the Institution, in the present depleted condition of its Treasury, has no cotton to sell; yet it is equally true, that those who have sustained it thus far, by their purse, their time and their talents, will most cheerfully continue their aid and their assistance—

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549491P3' xml:id='OTP32549491P3'>My last report, dated Oct 28<add place='above'><hi rend='underline'>th</hi></add>,,/63, was written at Monticello, Lawrence County, where the Institution was then located.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549491P4' xml:id='OTP32549491P4'>The Legislature having made an appropriation of two thousand (2,000) dollars to defray the expenses of moving back to our home in Jackson,—arrangements were made by your direction; and the Superintendent with his family, pupils, and such furniture as had been preserved from impressment, or purchased by us, arrived safely in Jackson about the first of August. Altho' every care was taken to avoid expense in making this change, and teams were procured at the very lowest price of fifteen dollars per day—the aggregate of expenses thus incurred was eighteen hundred, nineteen 50/100 dollars ($1819<add place='above'><hi rend='underline'>50</hi></add>) as per accounts already rendered to you.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549491P5' xml:id='OTP32549491P5'>Since my return to Jackson, I have paid for repairs on the buildings, and putting the grounds in order ($573<add place='above'><hi rend='underline'>50</hi></add>) five hundred seventy three 50/100 dollars, and for furniture ($311 75/100) three hundred and eleven 75/100 dollars, making a total for removal, repairs, and furniture of ($2704 75/100) two thousand seven hundred and $ 75/100 dollars.
</p>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549492P1' xml:id='OTP32549492P1'>The Institution is exceedingly destitute of suitable furniture. While in Monti-cello I managed to hire a few articles, and bought a small quantity. We are now deprived of the hired furniture; and many of the articles purchased, and of those saved from impressment have been worn out, broken, or destroyed,—so that the pupils cannot be decently supplied with beds or bed covers, table furniture, towels, chairs, washboards, dippers, &amp;<add place='above'>c</add>, &amp;,<add place='above'>c</add>, and the store room, and kitchen, are almost equally destitute of suitable materials.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549492P2' xml:id='OTP32549492P2'>The pupils, too, who are dependent on the state for everything, have worn out the clothing and shoes, that I have procured for them, and are now almost <rs ref='#S96659'>destitute</rs>.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549492P3' xml:id='OTP32549492P3'>Other pupils, who have heretofore furnished thier own clothing, now write me that they cannot get a supply, and cannot come to school, unless I can assist them in getting such articles as are absolutely necessary. To supply any of these wants, with our present income, is utterly impossible. All our funds have been used, and the school is now in debt.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549492P4' xml:id='OTP32549492P4'>The amount appropriated of eight thousand dollars (8,000$) (it was <hi rend='underline'>six thousand</hi> per annum before the war) will not pay the current expenses here in Jackson, where every thing that we con-sume must be bought at exorbitant prices; and where servant hire and fuel alone will cost, at present rates, fully one half of that amount per annum; leaving only $4,000<add place='above'><hi rend='underline'>00</hi></add> per annum,

The ten (10) dollars, thus left for all these expenses per day would not furnish a single day's board to a traveler in one of our Jackson <rs ref='#S77111'>Hotels</rs>; and yet hotel expenses are no higher in proportion than ours.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549493P1' xml:id='OTP32549493P1'>While in Monticello our expenses for servant hire and fuel did not exceed $1,200<add place='above'><hi rend='underline'>00</hi></add>,, per annum and our garden and field provided us with an abundance of vegetables, green corn, early potatoes &amp;<add place='above'>c</add>, and we could buy and kill beeves and raise our own pigs and poultry.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549493P2' xml:id='OTP32549493P2'>As we arrived in Jackson too late, <del rend='overstrike'>all for</del> for gardening, all these things must be purchased in the market for money. There, I could buy many articles needed by <rs ref='#S58612'>farmers</rs> at wholesale prices ^and echange them for provisions at retail prices—^—thus making quite a profit for the bene-fit of our funds. In Jackson the <rs ref='#S50738'>merchants</rs> make all such exchanges. Thus it will be seen, that we must now depend upon our funds to meet all expenses.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549493P3' xml:id='OTP32549493P3'>Before the Institution was moved from Lawrence Co.—it was suggested that here it would be easy to get a permit to sell cotton in <rs ref='#S51788'>Vicksburg</rs>, and thus get supplies for our Institution at low prices. Such an arrangement would be a great benefit to the school, and would save much expense to the state.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549493P4' xml:id='OTP32549493P4'>Now is the proper time to purchase corn, meat potatoes, fuel, and clothing for the coming year. I trust that the suggestion of getting the most costly of these supplies from within the <rs ref='#S71916'>enemy's</rs>

At least six thousand dollars are needed to make these purchases. We shall have to provide this year for thirteen, or perhaps fifteen, pupils.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549494P1' xml:id='OTP32549494P1'>During the past year the pupils have made rapid progress in their studies—and their health has been generally very good. No <rs ref='#S63262'>deaths</rs>, and no very serious cases of <rs ref='#S69274'>sickness</rs>, have occurred in the last three years. It is proper that I should remind you of the fact that by special act of the Legis-lature at the last (called) session, Miss <rs ref='#S32064055'>Bettie Sherrod</rs>, a seeing pupil about eighteen years old, was placed in the Institution to be educated at the public expense,—and by the same act your board is ordered to furnish Dempsey Sherrod <hi rend='underline'>permanently</hi> with furnished room and board.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32549494P2' xml:id='OTP32549494P2'>This, of course, materially increases the expenses of the Institution.
