                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32026650P0'>James Madison Wells was an anti-secession figure in Louisiana during the Civil War who served as that state's governor during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026650P1'>Born to a wealthy family on January 7, 1808, near Alexandria, Louisiana, Wells attended school in Kentucky and Connecticut before studying law in Cincinnati, Ohio. He moved back to Louisiana in 1829 to oversee plantations owned by his family. He inherited large tracts of land and became a wealthy slaveowner. Not content with being only a planter, Wells became active in public office and political circles. He was first appointed sheriff of Rapides Parish in 1840 and participated in Whig meetings. He changed parties in the 1850s, joining the Democrats and supporting Stephen Douglas during the 1860 presidential election. He opposed secession and became a highly controversial figure in Louisiana during the Civil War. Confederate officials arrested him for his Unionist sentiments, but he was released. Later in the war, he led Unionist partisans in irregular warfare against Confederate military activities in Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026650P2'>Due to his staunch Unionist position, Wells became lieutenant governor in the pro-Union Louisiana state government in 1864. He was then made governor in 1865 and generally worked with federal Reconstruction officials. However, Wells’s support for the rights of free Blacks and former slaves was inconsistent. He supported Black voting rights, but appointed several former Confederates with white supremacist attitudes to state positions. Wells did little to prevent racial tension and violence in Louisiana in 1866, leading to his removal by U.S. Army officials in 1867.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026650P3'>Wells supported the Republican Party during the 1870s and accepted an appointment to oversee voting returns in Louisiana in 1873. His efforts helped overturn some fraudulent elections which had benefitted conservative white Democrats. He then received a federal position in 1874 as surveyor of customs at the Port of New Orleans and remained in that office until 1880.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026650P4'>Wells died on February 28, 1899. He was married to Mary Scott and had fourteen children. He is buried in Old Rapides Cemetery in Pineville, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

It surrendered with the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana and was mustered out of service on April 1, 1865.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P0'>During the Civil War, Union and Confederate authorities operated prison camps to hold soldiers captured during combat operations between 1861 and 1865. More than 210,000 Union soldiers and more than 460,000 Confederate soldiers became prisoners of war during the conflict. Several prison camps were originally military training camps converted into holding facilities out of necessity. As the war progressed, new camps were constructed specifically to hold prisoners of war. Prison camp conditions deteriorated as large numbers of new detainees arrived, particularly after large battles, stretching existing camps beyond their intended capacities. The most notorious prisons were the Camp Sumter (more popularly known as Andersonville) in Georgia and Camp Douglas in Illinois. More than 30,000 Union prisoners (15%) died in captivity, while almost 26,000 Confederate prisoners (12%) died in Union hands.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P1'>Early in the war, Union and Confederate authorities engaged in a parole system, which typically involved exchanging prisoners. The system occasionally involved instances when direct exchanges were not possible, but officials still released prisoners of war under oath to not take up arms again until the opposing governments had processed a legal exchange at a later date. Parolees guilty of violating the conditions of their release were subject to execution. One notable example of widespread parole was Ulysses S. Grant’s release of thousands of Confederate prisoners captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. This parole system was common in European warfare, but was most often used due to practical limitations of field armies detaining large numbers of prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P2'>The parole system broke down in 1863 when the Confederate government refused to recognize African American Union soldiers as legitimate combatants. Additionally, Union officials recognized that the Confederacy, with its smaller pool of manpower, benefitted more from the parole system than the Union. As a result, the parole system almost entirely ceased in 1864 and the numbers of prisoners of war held in camps in the Union and Confederacy increased significantly. It resumed in early 1865, when the Confederate war effort was collapsing. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.
