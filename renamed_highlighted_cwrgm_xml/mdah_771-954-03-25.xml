                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

Several more appeared during the next few years, and by the time Mississippi entered the Union in 1817 at least half a dozen different publications had emerged. Over the following years, newspaper companies opened as communities grew and the demand for information increased. Publishing resources (like paper and print presses) became more available aiding in the news media boom. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Mississippi towns or counties had a local newspaper, published daily or weekly. Major cities typically had more than one newspaper, often published by competing political parties. Most newspapers went out of business after only a few years; however, a few continued in print for decades, including <hi rend='italic'>The Columbus Democrat</hi> in Columbus (1836–1877), <hi rend='italic'>The Kosciusko Chronicle</hi> in Kosciusko (1846–1892), and the <hi rend='italic'>Grenada Sentinel</hi> of Grenada which started in 1868 and remained in publication until 1955. Overall, as many as two hundred different publishers started daily or weekly newspapers in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57068P0'>Many southern states viewed Republican Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency in November 1860 as a threat to the institution of slavery and the climax of a series of sectional crises throughout the 1850s. Mississippians had debated the merits of secession as early as 1850, and Lincoln's election renewed calls for secession. A week after Lincoln's election, Governor John J. Pettus encouraged the state's politicians to hold a secession convention. South Carolina's secession in December 1860 provoked further calls for Mississippi to follow. Delegates met in the Mississippi House of Representatives in Jackson, Mississippi on January 7, 1861 to decide the state's future. Only two days into the Convention, on January 9, 1861, delegates voted 83-15 to secede from the United States, making Mississippi the second state to do so. The Convention then passed an ordinance of secession laying out the state's motivations, each of which tied directly to the institution of slavery (National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63104P0'>The Whig Party was a national political party in the United States from 1833 to 1860. During its roughly twenty-five years of existence, it stood as one of two major political parties (the other being the Democratic Party) that dominated American national politics. Four U.S. presidents were elected as Whig candidates, and several leading American congressmen and statesmen identified as Whigs. The party generally opposed aggressive American expansion westward, and denounced the Mexican War. Whigs supported protective tariffs, federal support for infrastructure, and the national bank.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63104P1'>The Whig Party, like the Democratic Party, had members across the United States. It struggled to remain united during debates over slavery. Northern Whigs tended to be more hostile to slavery than northern Democrats, and the overtly anti-slavery parties, such as the Free Soil Party, in the late 1840s and early 1850s were primarily made up of former Whigs. After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved restrictions against slavery in the territories, thousands of northern Whigs, disgruntled northern Democrats, and Free Soil members formed the Republican Party as a major national political organization. The Whig Party remained cohesive enough to put a candidate on the 1856 presidential ballot, but the results of that election proved that the Republican Party had supplanted the Whigs in political power. The Whig Party fell apart over the next few years, in large part because Republicans adopted many of the Whig Party’s economic policies. Conservative Whigs in the south tried to inhabit a middle ground during the contentious 1860 presidential debate by forming the Constitutional Union Party that opposed secession and avoided taking sides on the slavery debate. This effort meant the end of the Whig Party as a viable party in American politics. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71099P0'>The tag "Secessionists" refer to those Americans who supported leaving the Union and establishing an independent Confederate nation. States both North and South had threatened to secede from the United States throughout the nation's history, particularly in New England in 1814 and South Carolina in 1832. However, building tensions between abolitionists and enslavers in the North and South saw an increase in the frequency and fervor of secession threats emanating from southern states in the 1850s. The election of Republican Abraham Lincoln to the presidency in November 1860 provided the impetus many states needed to justify secession. Citing perceived threats to the institution of chattel slavery, on December 20, 1860, South Carolina left the Union, followed by six more lower-South states (Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana) over the next four months.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71099P1'>After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, and Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion on April 15, four more states from the upper-south (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee) seceded. Throughout the war, politicians and military commanders argued fiercely over the constitutionality of secession and debated whether the Confederate states had indeed seceded or instead remained in the Union, though in rebellion. While the fighting of the Civil War functionally ended the Confederacy's effort at secession, the question of those states' status remained an important one for shaping the prosecution of the war and the process of Reconstruction thereafter (HistoryNet).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P0'>A Unionist was "a member or supporter of the twenty-three Northern states that were not part of the seceding Confederacy during the American Civil War" (Wikipedia). Unionism in the South took on a variety of forms and encompassed many different beliefs. While most northerners sided with the Union, many southerners did as well. Even prior to secession, no solid white South existed, as many white southerners in mountainous and upcountry areas of the South did not own enslaved persons. While some areas like eastern Tennessee and parts of northern Alabama rejected secession outright for the entire war, secession produced renewed patriotism for many non-enslaving whites in the South. That patriotism faltered for many as the awful realities of wartime violence and poverty struck even as early as 1861. Many poor white southerners viewed the Confederacy's conscription, impressment, and taxation policies as elitist, forcing many families to, if not support the Union per se, at least oppose the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P1'>Entire unionist communities developed throughout the war to shield those loyal to the Union or opposed to the Confederacy, as well as deserters from the Confederate Army and, in certain cases, escaped enslaved persons. Southern unionism often led to internal armed conflict between southerners, as bands of guerilla fighters raided Confederate depots and shipping for supplies and even attacked some Confederate units. While unionist strongholds most frequently developed in the mountainous regions of the South and the border states, Unionism spread throughout the entire Confederacy, including one of the most notable in Jones County, Mississippi, where ex-Confederate soldier Newton Knight and roughly 500 others formed the so-called "Free State of Jones" and opposed Confederate forces until the war's end. The presence of Unionism across the South stifled the Confederate war effort in many ways and revealed that tensions of national loyalty, race, class, and gender remained complicated even for southern whites (American Heritage; Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

<p corresp='TTP32182322P4' xml:id='OTP32182322P4'>I came to Jackson with the intention of seeing you and asking your advice and assistance in getting up a petition to the <rs ref='#S52439'>President</rs> for the <rs ref='#S62927'>pardon</rs> of my late law partner, and friend, Hon <rs ref='#S103335'>Jno T. Lamkin</rs>—since my arrival here I have learned what it was my earnest wish and hope would be the case: that you have been <rs ref='#S98996'>appointed</rs> Provisional Governor of the State. I came on this mission without the solicitation or even knowledge of Mr Lamkin. He is a very particular= friend of mine and I would under any circumstances do anything for him in my power; but I feel more interest in reference to his pardon than I otherwise would because I was one of the principal parties who induced him—against his will at the time—to become a candidate for, and did everything in my power to have him <rs ref='#S95151'>elected</rs> to the of-fice, which excludes him from the benefit of general <rs ref='#S25025824'>amnesty</rs>. My reasons for this course were, that I thought any change from <rs ref='#S25004039'>M<add place='above'>c</add>Rae</rs> as a <rs ref='#S52126'>representative</rs> could only be productive of good. M<add place='above'>c</add>R was a leading <rs ref='#S71099'>se-cessionist</rs> and most radical war man; and I knew Lamkin <del rend='overstrike'>was</del> to be just the opposite. And I=

          <p corresp='TTP32182323P0' xml:id='OTP32182323P0'>thought there was a reaction taking place amongst the people which would lead to good results—a hope began to dawn for me that there was conservatism enough in the country to save it from utter ruin. I knew Lamkin's habits of thought generally and= while I <del rend='overstrike'>thought</del> ^found^ him more radical at that time than I <del rend='overstrike'>would have</del> expected, or wished still I knew he= would do to trust on any question, and I thought he was the man to beat M<add place='above'>c</add>Rae, hence I took the respon-sibility to announce his name without seeing him &amp; to induce him not to withdraw it, which it was his inclination to do. I don't wish you to understand me as stating these facts to show any influence that I may have with either Lamkin (beyond that of an intimate &amp; very humble friend) or the people for if persecution by M<add place='above'>c</add>R's friends and ^thro' him^ the <hi rend='underline'>guan darn</hi> <rs ref='#S63093'>Richmond</rs> administration could have made me repent my action in this particular I would have long since bitterly rued it, but simply to show you how I stand towards L. in this question.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32182323P1' xml:id='OTP32182323P1'>I suppose I need not say to you that Mr Lamkin was an old line <rs ref='#S63104'>Whig</rs>, and a bitter opponent of <rs ref='#S71100'>secession</rs>. After the <rs ref='#S57068'>State seceded</rs> like many other good &amp; true <rs ref='#S25024541'>Union</rs> men he went off on that doctrine of first allegiance being due to the state &amp;c. and took service in the <rs ref='#S70882'>army</rs> as a Captain, but he never to my knowledge lost his conservatism.

          <p corresp='TTP32182324P0' xml:id='OTP32182324P0'>I am well satisfied that if the President knew all the facts in his case he would readily exercise the pardoning power in his favor. I desire to pursue such a course as will bring the matter before the President and obtain his favorable action at the earliest practicable period. It will have great weight and I should like to get your recommendation to this effect and your advice gen-erally upon the subject.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32182324P1' xml:id='OTP32182324P1'>And now Governor, I come to a much more delicate &amp; unpleasant subject and one which I <del rend='overstrike'>assure</del> ^hope^ you will believe me when I say it I approach with un-feigned diffidence. I feel as if I wanted to make a short story of it—and shall be as brief as possible. The whole of it is, that I am induced by circumstances over which I have no control and the distressed condi-tion of our country—which fate I foresaw and have done everything to avert—to place myself amongst a class of men for whom I have a natural aversion, to call it by no harsher name—to become what I once thought I never would under any circumstances an office seeker. Though I had an ample compe-tency before, the war has left me a <rs ref='#S96659'>poor man</rs>; and what is more it has left the country in such a condi-tion, that I can find nothing to put my hand to by which I can make a living.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32182324P2' xml:id='OTP32182324P2'>I but state the simple facts. I was opposed to secession—you know with what bloodhound ferocity Union men were pursued, both as to person and property and the

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32182325P1' xml:id='OTP32182325P1'>I am honest when I say I do not base my hopes of receiving favor upon my misfortunes: and if you do not think that I am qualified and will discharge with fidelity and efficiency the duties of any office you may confer upon me, I will not ask it.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32182325P2' xml:id='OTP32182325P2'>When I came to Jackson I did not intend to make this application, but since my arrival it has been suggested to me by my friends. So far as I can learn it is not known what offices you will have the disposal of. Mr <rs ref='#S63383'>Cooper</rs> is a friend of mine and is in possession of all my views and wishes in reference to an <rs ref='#S98996'>appointment</rs>. You can learn of my qualifications from <rs ref='#S63934'>Judge</rs> <rs ref='#S32020517'>Hurst</rs> who knows me well, or any other <rs ref='#S94600'>lawyer</rs> or prominent man in South Missi.
