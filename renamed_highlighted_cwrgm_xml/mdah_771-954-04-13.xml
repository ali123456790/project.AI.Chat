                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52243P0'>Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth president of the United States, whose election to the White House as an anti-slavery Republican in 1860 led several southern states to declare themselves separate from the Union and create the Confederate States of America. Lincoln was commander-in-chief of Union forces during the Civil War. Over the course of four years, Lincoln oversaw the Union war effort and took steps to end the institution of slavery to aid the federal military effort and destroy the root cause of the north versus south sectional conflict.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P1'>Born on February 12, 1809, near Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln moved with is family to Indiana as a child and grew up in a poor, frontier society. Although he received minimal formal education, Lincoln proved to be highly intelligent and a voracious reader. He held various jobs as a young man, including working on a flatboat down the Mississippi River, splitting rails and logs, and as a store keeper. He moved to Illinois in 1830 and in 1832, he volunteered for military service during the Black Hawk War in Illinois. Elected captain of a militia company, Lincoln saw no combat, but credited his time leading men in the military as one of the most proud and instructional periods of his life.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P2'>After the Black Hawk War, Lincoln operated a general store in New Salem, Illinois. When the business began to lose money, he decided to study law and become an attorney. Unlike most other lawyers, who attended a law school or studied under established attorneys, Lincoln’s education was self-guided through legal texts and books he borrowed or purchased. Meanwhile, he developed an interest in politics. After an unsuccessful run for the Illinois legislature in 1833, he ran again in 1834 and won a seat in the state’s House of Representatives. He served one term and became known for his support of internal improvements and his Free Soil position on slavery, which opposed slavery in the new territories and criticized abolition (the immediate, forced end of slavery).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P3'>After leaving the Illinois legislature in 1836, Lincoln became a successful attorney in Springfield. He handled many different types of cases, and over the course of his legal career, representing poor individuals in criminal cases as well as large businesses, such as the Illinois Central Railroad. Lincoln argued 175 cases before the Illinois Supreme Court, serving as the single attorney in 51 of those cases (31 of which he won). As an attorney, he developed a reputation for integrity and earned the nickname “Honest Abe.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P4'>In 1846, Lincoln won an election as a member of the Whig Party to the U.S. House of Representatives for Illinois. As a freshman congressman, he helped author legislation to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but the bill died due to insufficient support. More notably, Lincoln opposed the Mexican-American War which erupted in 1846 due to a border dispute between the United States and Mexico. He criticized Democratic president James K. Polk, but this proved unpopular in his home state. He had promised to only serve one term in Congress and declined to run for reelection. He returned to Springfield after the expiration of his term in 1849 and resumed his law practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P5'>Lincoln’s political ambitions continued to grow in the 1850s. The volatile debate over the future of slavery in the territories, especially following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854—which overturned slavery restrictions established by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and opened all western territories to slavery through popular sovereignty (vote of the residents)—inspired Lincoln to speak publicly about his opposition to slavery. His chief rival became Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas, a powerful voice in the national Democratic Party, and the author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Lincoln gave numerous speeches denouncing slavery as a moral wrong and opposing its extension into the territories. However, like most northerners, he was not an abolitionist and did not advocate for the immediate end of slavery across the United States. Most white Americans during the 1850s embraced white supremacy, and many northerners did not want African Americans—as slaves or as free people—in their communities. Lincoln believed that southern states had the legal right to maintain the institution of slavery within their own borders, and he fended off accusations that he was for African American equality. For years he gave tacit support to a plan promoted among moderate politicians to send freed slaves to Africa.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P6'>The issue of slavery in the territories effectively broke apart the Whig Party and gave rise to the new Republican Party. Lincoln joined this new anti-slavery party and by 1858 received the party’s nomination in Illinois to challenge Douglas’s reelection to the U.S. Senate. Upon receiving the nomination, Lincoln gave one of his most famous speeches, declaring in part that “a house divided against itself cannot stand”—a reference to the United States being half slaveholding and half free—and predicting that the fight over slavery would either make the country give in to slaveholding interests or end the institution. During the 1858 Illinois campaign, Lincoln and Douglas engaged in eight public debates which have become the most famous political debates in United States history. Douglas championed his principle of “popular sovereignty,” allowing white residents of the territories to make their new states free or slaveholding, while Lincoln advanced a moral opposition to slavery in the territories as contrary to the principles of American freedom. Douglas ultimately won the Senate election, but the debates catapulted Lincoln to national fame and the leading voice for the growing anti-slavery movement in the north
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P7'>Only two years later, in 1860, the Republican Party nominated Lincoln for U.S. president. His chief rival was, again, Stephen Douglas. The election was the most contested and significant in American history. The Democratic Party split during its convention over the defense of slavery. Douglas and his outwardly neutral platform on slavery received the party’s formal nomination, but many southern delegates walked out to hold their convention, nominating John C. Breckenridge as the champion of pro-slavery interests. Talk of secession, which had circulated in years past, increased as southern politicians warned that election of Lincoln would be a direct assault upon their slaveholding interests and justify disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P8'>Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election without any southern support, not only placing the first truly anti-slavery president in the White House but proving that northern voters could elect a candidate against southern interests. Within weeks, states in the lower south began holding secession conventions to declare their separation from the Union. South Carolina led the way with its ordnance of secession passing on December 20, 1860. Mississippi was second, on January 9, 1861. In total, seven southern states declared secession even before Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P9'>Lincoln entered the presidency in the midst of this secession crisis. He rejected the legitimacy of the lower south’s separation from the Union. The matter erupted into open hostilities in April 1861, when Confederate forces attacked and overwhelmed federal troops at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. In response, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion, as he called it. Northern states responded enthusiastically, while several states in the upper south—including Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee—chose to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P10'>Lincoln’s objective at the start of the Civil War was restoration of the Union as it was. He resisted efforts by more radical anti-slavery northerners to attack slavery itself, and overruled Union general John C. Frémont’s effort to liberate slaves in Missouri in 1861. His actions were guided by concerns regarding his legal authority to challenge slavery where it already existed, and from fears that such steps would drive moderate Unionists in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland into the Confederacy. (Lincoln still personally opposed slavery and in 1862 signed an emancipation act liberating enslaved people in Washington, D.C., fulfilling a goal he had first undertaken as a congressman in the 1840s.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P11'>However, as Confederate military forces won multiple battlefield victories in 1861 and 1862, prolonging the conflict, Lincoln sought more desperate measures. For one, thousands of enslaved people had fled to Union lines, and more arriving daily. Secondly, the institution was the Confederacy’s greatest economic and labor interest. Millions of enslaved people grew crops that fed and funded the Confederate war effort, and southern officials used slave labor to construct forts and trenches that held back the Union armies. Recognizing that the Union could not defeat the Confederacy while protecting or leaving the institution of slavery untouched, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in secessionist areas permanently free. Although the proclamation was limited in scope (as it was a military measure that did not, nor could not, liberate enslaved people in areas not in rebellion against federal authority), it was a revolutionary act in American history. It formally changed the Union objective of the war, from preserving it as it was to “a new birth of freedom,” as Lincoln famously said in a speech in November 1863 at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Additionally, the proclamation authorized federal officers to protect the freedom of all enslaved people who fled to Union armies in Confederate territories and to liberate those they encountered during their campaigns in the south. Finally, the Emancipation Proclamation formally authorized the United States military to enlist African American soldiers. As a result around 180,000 black soldiers fought for the Union during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P12'>Throughout the Civil War, Lincoln struggled to lead the Union war effort in a challenging political and military environment. Democrats in the north vehemently opposed his administration and Republican Party policies, particularly those against slavery. Union generals in Virginia failed to defeat the Confederate army, lowering morale in the north and boosting prospects of southern success. Lincoln managed to handle these various challenges well, often accepting public criticism from generals and relieving them of command only when they failed to deliver military victories. He also stretched the authority of the presidency, authorizing the imprisonment of critics he believed directly harmed the war effort. While his administration was accused of violating the civil rights of some Americans, the Republican-led Congress frequently backed Lincoln and expanding his power.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P13'>In 1864, Lincoln feared he would lose reelection as the Civil War continued to drag on, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and millions of dollars. However, through battlefield successes by Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan in Virginia and Georgia, Lincoln won the election and support to continue the war until Confederate defeat. He also worked behind the scenes with Congress and various state leaders to legally end slavery through a constitutional amendment. While he voiced some support for the old plan of relocating freed slaves to Africa, by the end of the war Lincoln knew such plan was impractical and he supported protecting basic civil rights of African Americans within the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P14'>In the spring of 1865, the Confederate war effort began to collapse. Much of Lincoln’s attention was turned to reconstructing the former Confederate areas, some of which were already under federal control. He advocated for a speedy reunification, without malice or vengeance, and one in which former secessionists were welcomed back to the Union without slavery and with some recognitions of black civil rights. In April 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to General Grant in Virginia and Union forces chased down the last southern troops across the lower south. On April 14, as the Civil War was ending, Lincoln was shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. The mortally wounded president was carried to a boarding house across the street where he passed away the following morning. Lincoln’s murder ended most hopes for a peaceful reconstruction, as it inflamed tensions in the north and energized Radical Republicans who Lincoln had largely held in check.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P15'>Lincoln was married to Mary Todd, who was from a wealthy family in Kentucky. He had four sons, only one of whom (Robert) survived into adulthood. Lincoln is buried in a large tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32025440P0'>John Wynn Davidson was a Union general during the Civil War who also saw extensive service in the U.S. Army in the western territories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P1'>Born on August 14, 1825, in Fairfax County, Virginia, Davidson graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1845. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the First U.S. Dragoons and saw extensive action in the Mexican-American War between 1846 and 1848. Afterwards, Davidson led U.S. troops in the western territories, conducting operations against Native Americans, including an attack against the Pomo tribe at Clear Lake, California, which has become known as the “Bloody Island Massacre.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P2'>With the outbreak of the Civil War, Davidson remained loyal to the Union and accepted command of a brigade within the Army of the Potomac in Virginia. He participated in battles at Yorktown and Williamsburg, and distinguished himself during the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond in 1862. He was then sent west and given command of the District of St. Louis and the Army of Southeast Missouri. In late 1863, Davidson led a division in the Army of Arkansas, scoring victories at the Battle of Bayou Fourche, leading to the Union capture of Little Rock.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P3'>In November and December 1864, Davidson led 4,000 Union cavalry soldiers in a raid from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, across southern Mississippi toward the Alabama border to cut the M&amp;O Railroad line. The effort was a diversion, meant to draw Confederate attention away from Confederate operations in Tennessee. Following that mission, Davidson was given administrative assignments in federally-occupied Mississippi. He remained there until January 1866 at the rank of brevet (honorary) major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P4'>After leaving Mississippi, Davidson returned to military duty in the western territories. He was made lieutenant colonel of the Tenth Cavalry Regiment, an African American unit nicknamed the “Buffalo Soldiers.” He earned the nickname “Black Jack” while commanding the Black cavalrymen. While in service in Kansas from 1868 to 1871, Davidson served as a professor of military science at Kansas State Agricultural College (modern-day Kansas State University).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P5'>In 1879, Davidson was promoted to colonel and given command of the Second Cavalry Regiment in Montana Territory. He died two years later, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He was married to Clara B. McGunnegle and had at least one child that survived to adulthood. Davidson is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P0'>An immigrant is "a person who has come to a different country in order to live there permanently" (Cambridge Dictionary). Immigrants from other nations have always comprised a significant portion of the U.S. population, yet the number was relatively small until the middle decades of the nineteenth century, when political and economic turmoil in Europe forced many people to flee. Immigrants came from all over the world, though the vast majority (90.4 percent by one estimation) came from Europe (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 54). In the West, and particularly in California, the United States also saw a large increase in Chinese and Japanese-born immigrants.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P1'>Immigrants came to the United States for varied reasons. Many Eastern and Western Europeans immigrated to flee religious or political persecution, while immigrants from around the world sought to improve their economic circumstances in the U. S. Immigrants to the U. S. settled overwhelmingly in urban centers, though some few also settled in rural areas of the South and Midwest.

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P2'>Immigration often led to racial, ethnic, and class conflicts. Many native-born, white, Protestant Americans feared the ethnic and religious differences of immigrants as well as the potential economic competition they represented. This led to the rise of nativism, or discrimination and often violence against those born outside of the U. S., and the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know-Nothing Party in the 1840s and 1850s. Free African Americans and white European immigrants who both often faced discrimination and poverty also perceived each other as economic competition. This tension occasionally produced outbreaks of violence like the New York City Draft Riots of 1863 in which predominantly Catholic Irish and German immigrants, having been drafted into the U. S. Army but refusing to fight for Black freedom, rioted in response to the Emancipation Proclamation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P3'>Ultimately, the American Civil War placed native-born and foreign-born soldiers alongside each other in battle, cooling the nativist sentiments of the decades prior; however, non-European immigrants, especially Chinese-born, continued to face discrimination based on their immigrant status. (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 53-100; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

We are all rejoiced here to learn that you have been <rs ref='#S98996'>appointed</rs> Provisional Governor over our state.

<p corresp='TTP32185583P4' xml:id='OTP32185583P4'>It is the first streak of day we have seen for a long time. In your firm integrity, ripe judgment and experience—as well as devotion to your state, we have the assurance of a future as prosperous as your surroundings will permit. You have a great and responsible work before you. While all will unite in acknowledging that you are in all respects fully equal to the task, I conceive it to be the duty of all, to offer you a firm and willing support, and to ask of you, what it is, that can be done, to aid you in your great work.—With you as a leader, and a prompt execution, of a firm determination on the part of the people, to follow and assist you, I feel that poor <del rend='overstrike'>and</del> misguided and ruined Mississippi, may be in a measure recuperated. I would be much pleased, if you would say something to me,—of the times—If it brings, no hope, it will serve to enlighten, and thereby enable me, to shape my course for the future.

<p corresp='TTP32185583P5' xml:id='OTP32185583P5'>My attachments and endearments for Mississippi, and especially for Adams County are very great.—In it, from early childhood my Grandfather was raised.—In it, my

I have no torturings of conscience for having assisted in the inau-guration of the system, which has led to our present ruin and degradation. My record will show that I offered opposition until <rs ref='#S71100'>secession</rs> was consumated—and upon us.—Out of it came a government.—Within its limits, was my home.—I would not leave it.—but resolved to do all in my power to defend it.—I gave assiss=tance in trying to combat with the result of secession, it has been a failure, and we are thereby a ruined and degraded people.—I am now ready, and willing, to give all the assisstance I can to inaugurate a system which will bring us up out of this ruin and degradation, (if you will propose one) and let us thereby live, and be as prosperous as circumstances will allow. When I bring my mind to reflect upon this subject, I am met with many obstacles which present difficulties, appearing not to admit of being obviated. I have not however succumbed, hoping that the good sense of the people, both north and south, will yet prevail, and the South if not rendered as prosperous as formerly, will be made, endurable.

I will esteem it, as a very instructive, and great privilege, to be permitted to receive from you at any time, any thing pertaining to our present and future condition,—and if it can be so shaped as to be endurable—and what is it that should be done to make it so?—Is it important that all should take the <rs ref='#S25025824'>amnesty oath</rs>?
