                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25006250P0'>Alexander Mosby Clayton was a judge and political figure in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006250P1'>Born on January 15, 1801, in Campbell County, Virginia, Clayton studied law and became a practicing attorney in that state in 1823. He moved to Arkansas Territory in 1832 to accept an appointment from President Andrew Jackson as a judge in the territory’s superior court. Five years later, he relocated to Mississippi. Clayton was elected to Mississippi’s High Court of Errors and Appeals (the precursor to the state’s Supreme Court) in 1842 and served until 1852. During that same period in Mississippi, Clayton was appointed the first president of the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees, and served in that role until 1852. In 1853, Clayton received an appointment from President Franklin Pierce to be consul in Havana, Cuba. He served one year in that role, and then returned to Mississippi to practice law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006250P2'>During the 1850s, Clayton became an outspoken proponent of secession in response to northern anti-slavery activities. He was a delegate to the Nashville Convention, a meeting of southern delegates to debate the political dispute over slavery in territories gained from the Mexican-American War, and promoted a hardline stance, including disunion, to protect slaveholding interests. Ten years later, in January 1861, at Mississippi's secession convention in the wake of Abraham Lincoln’s election to the president, Clayton again advocated secession, and wrote the state’s declaration of reasons for separating from the Union. He was then selected to represent the state in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States during the spring of 1861. Following his short time in the Confederate Congress, Clayton served as a Confederate district court judge during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006250P3'>A year after the war ended, Clayton received an appointment as a circuit judge in Mississippi. He held that position for three years before being removed by federal officials in 1869, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and its provision that prohibited previous U.S. officials who had supported the Confederacy from holding military or civil office. He returned to private law practice, as well as worked as director of the Mississippi Central Railroad.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25006250P4'>Clayton died on September 30, 1889. He was married to Barbara Barker and had at least two children who survived to adulthood. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005041P0'>Military schools are educational programs that incorporate military studies with traditional academic topics. They often emphasize engineering and technical studies. The school lifestyle and environment typically model the military; students are considered cadets, wear uniforms and conduct formation drills, and follow a military-style chain of command. These schools were largely a nineteenth century development in the United States, following the creation of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, during Thomas Jefferson’s presidential administration. While that academy, and the United States Naval Academy, founded in 1845, were federal institutions, most military schools were private or state-funded programs. Military service was not required for the graduates of state or private military programs, but alumni from such schools often sought commissions in the military. Additionally, during the Civil War, the Union and the Confederate armies relied heavily upon graduates of state and federal military academies to train and lead the large numbers of civilian soldiers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63985P0'>Opened in 1802 at West Point, New York, the United States Military Academy is the oldest federal service academy in the United States. Proposed in legislation from Alexander Hamilton, and begun at the direction of President Thomas Jefferson, the academy (often referred to as “West Point”) started with few standards regarding age of cadets or length of study. The War of 1812 prompted revisions within the program and in 1817 the academy’s superintendent Colonel Sylvanus Thayer established a curriculum modeled after the École Polytechnique school in Paris, France, that emphasized technical and engineering instruction. The program was so successful, that it became the model engineering program within the United States during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P1'>By the 1830s, most commissioned officers in the U.S. Army were West Point graduates. However, distrust among many Americans of a strong national government and aristocracy (as well as jealousy among other aspiring military officers), led to some calls for the elimination of the academy. These calls went unheeded, and the strong performance by West Point graduates during the Mexican War in the late 1840s highlighted the value of the academy to the U.S. military.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P2'>The Civil War divided West Point alumni. Some of the most notable academy graduates and staff served the Confederacy, most notably Robert E. Lee. Most of the leading Union generals were also West Point alum, including Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, and George B. McClellan. Over the course of the war, 294 West Point graduates achieved the rank of general in the Union Army and 151 rose to the rank of general in the Confederate Army. The war also cost the lives of 105 West Point graduates, while 151 were wounded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P3'>Due to political tensions within the U.S. from the Civil War, southern applicants were not admitted to West Point until 1868—three years after the end of the war. The first Black cadet, James Webster Smith, was admitted in 1870, however he faced severe discrimination by other cadets and some staff, leading to altercations, a suspension, and eventually dismissal under controversial circumstances. The first African American cadet to graduate West Point was Henry O. Flipper in 1877.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P4'>West Point continues to operate as military service academy training college-aged cadets for the officer corps of the U.S. Army. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71099P0'>The tag "Secessionists" refer to those Americans who supported leaving the Union and establishing an independent Confederate nation. States both North and South had threatened to secede from the United States throughout the nation's history, particularly in New England in 1814 and South Carolina in 1832. However, building tensions between abolitionists and enslavers in the North and South saw an increase in the frequency and fervor of secession threats emanating from southern states in the 1850s. The election of Republican Abraham Lincoln to the presidency in November 1860 provided the impetus many states needed to justify secession. Citing perceived threats to the institution of chattel slavery, on December 20, 1860, South Carolina left the Union, followed by six more lower-South states (Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana) over the next four months.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71099P1'>After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, and Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion on April 15, four more states from the upper-south (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee) seceded. Throughout the war, politicians and military commanders argued fiercely over the constitutionality of secession and debated whether the Confederate states had indeed seceded or instead remained in the Union, though in rebellion. While the fighting of the Civil War functionally ended the Confederacy's effort at secession, the question of those states' status remained an important one for shaping the prosecution of the war and the process of Reconstruction thereafter (HistoryNet).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

To your kindness &amp; influence we most respectfully appeal! We have a <rs ref='#S25013472'>son &amp; brother</rs> at <rs ref='#S32026766'>Fort Warren</rs>, <rs ref='#S73321'>Mass</rs>—Brig' Gen. <rs ref='#S32025746'>John. W. Frazer</rs> was <rs ref='#S32001560'>captured</rs> the 9<add place='above'>th</add> Sept 1863! Tho' a native of this state, he was sent by Miss. as a Cadet to <rs ref='#S63985'>West Point</rs>, was in the U. S. A. until 1861. The pressure of circumstances &amp; influence of friends, as in a thousand other instances, swaied his head &amp; heart, from their true points of inclination—He was no <rs ref='#S71099'>secessionist</rs>, but thought it his duty to "stand by the South"—He deeply deplored the ruin of his country, the severance of his <rs ref='#S70882'>army</rs> friends, the dissolution of his glorious old Union! It was with a sad heart, he bade it adieu, but with a sincere hope of compromise &amp; reconstruction—

<p corresp='TTP32185684P5' xml:id='OTP32185684P5'>Some few years since his father's family returned to <rs ref='#S63147'>Memphis</rs> but we suppose Gen. Frazer, may be claimed as a Missippian—Our mother has numbered her three score years &amp; ten—Soon "the golden broken will be broken, the pitcher loosened at the fountain"—<rs ref='#S63262'>Our father in Heaven</rs>—there are but few of us on Earth—our hearts are sad &amp; will not be comforted, because this our son &amp; brother, is not, with, us—

<p corresp='TTP32185684P6' xml:id='OTP32185684P6'>—We are prepared to give any security or bond, the circumstances may de-mand. But Oh! Gov—we implore you, if it be possible, to <hi rend='underline'>hasten</hi> the day of his <rs ref='#S32019844'>release</rs>! Then you shall have the grateful hearts &amp; best wishes of his mother &amp; sisters. We respectfully refer you to Judge <rs ref='#S25006250'>Alex. Clayton</rs>, Gen <rs ref='#S32026311'>Alex Bradford</rs>, Hon <rs ref='#S101726'>Watson</rs> of <rs ref='#S63000'>Holly Springs</rs>—old friends of the long ago.
