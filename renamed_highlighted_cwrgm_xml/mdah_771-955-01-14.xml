                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

U.S. Congress divides legislators into separate committees who write federal or national legislation, and a vast industry of lobbyists also help members write legislation on behalf of corporate and labor interests. Once written, the proposed legislation is introduced to both houses, and if the bill passes both chambers by a majority vote, it is sent to the U.S. President for passage, veto, or pocket-veto, and Congress can overcome the President's veto with a two-thirds majority vote.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32026703P0'>The United States Congress General Amnesty Act (1865) was enacted by President Andrew Johnson on May 29, 1865, giving amnesty (or an official pardon) to former Confederates who participated in the Civil War following an oath of allegiance to the United States and the acceptance of the abolition of enslavement. This act excluded high-ranking military leaders and officials, as well as those who committed war crimes. Johnson believed that amnesty was the surest way to rebuild the nation and the General Amnesty Act was one part of his Reconstruction Plan. This act was welcomed by many Northerners who wanted to move on from the Civil War, but was criticized by many radicals who felt the act was too lenient on Confederate actors and wanted those people excluded from society and punished for their actions in the war.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P0'>The tag "Confederate War Dissenters" refers to the white men and women who opposed or challenged the Confederacy internally. The South, even among whites, had never been socially, culturally, or economically homogenous. Indeed, many white southerners lived in rural hill country unsuitable for large-scale agriculture, and many of those white southerners were too impoverished to own enslaved persons. However, they nonetheless joined the Confederacy and went to war to preserve a broader social and economic structure predicated upon slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P1'>As the war drug on into its second and third years, its massive bloodshed and devastating economic impacts exposed the fault lines between socially and economically elite and non-elite in the Confederacy. White men, women, and children living in the Confederacy protested government policies like the Twenty Slave Law that exempted largely-elite enslavers from conscription if they owned twenty or more enslaved persons. Dissent could take many forms—ranging from private correspondence to boycotts, riots, and military rebellion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P2'>One of the largest instances of dissent within the Confederacy came in the Bread Riots of 1863. The Confederacy, notoriously unable to collect taxes, required citizens unable to pay taxes with currency to pay with a "tax-in-kind," or a payment of taxes with its equivalent in goods or livestock. This policy disproportionately affected impoverished women and children barely subsisting and often starving due to the loss of their husbands and fathers off fighting in the war. Women therefore rioted in the Confederate capital at Richmond, as well as in many other cities, in the spring of 1863 to demand bread from the Confederate government. The Bread Riots are only one example of many in which white southerners opposed varied elements of the war effort as it disproportionately subjected them to harm. Crucially, not all dissenters were pro-Union, as many supported the Confederacy's mission but not its policies (American Heritage).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P0'>While soldiers often receive the most attention in studies of the American Civil War, their families were vital to both the Union and Confederate war efforts. No family experienced the American Civil War in the same way, as racial, ethnic, geographic, and class differences greatly varied a particular families experience. For example, southern families more frequently faced the devastation of war on their homes, while rural families often suffered more from the loss or destruction of their property than did those in urban areas (National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P1'>As fathers and husbands marched off to war, they left behind women and children responsible for providing for themselves and keeping up family farms and businesses. Many of these families, especially those impoverished before the war, suffered greatly from the confiscation or destruction of their resources by both Union and Confederate militaries. The despair of many families produced class tensions in both North and South. For example, many women and children, beginning in Richmond, Virginia but extending across the South, rioted in 1863 for lack of bread or resources with which to make it. Other women and children across the country toiled in wartime industries by making clothing or munitions, while impoverished southern women and children often performed grueling agricultural labor just to support themselves. Elite, southern women often adopted the roles of enslavers, trying to maintain control of enslaved persons while traditionally male overseers went to war. African American families, many of them newly freed from enslavement, also struggled to support themselves and often lived in unsanitary, crowded contraband camps upheld by the Union Army (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25013472P2'>Families, however, not only maintained the home front but also visited soldiers in their camps, while many women served as nurses for wounded soldiers. An expansive subject tag, military families refers to any relation of a Union or Confederate soldier and sailor, and is intended to spotlight the experiences of people, often women and children, who are typically more difficult to uncover in historical records. While this subject tag largely refers to the experiences of families on the northern and southern home fronts, it also incorporates the minority of families members who accompanied men to the battle front.
