              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25026173P0'>Guerrilla warfare is a "type of warfare fought by irregulars in fast-moving, small-scale actions against orthodox military and police forces and, on occasion, against rival insurgent forces, either independently or in conjunction with a larger political-military strategy" (Britannica).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25026173P1'>In the American Civil War, both the United States and Confederate armies turned to guerrilla warfare at different points. The Confederacy saw the greatest prevalence of irregular fighting, as many Southerners resisted the earliest instances of invasion by fighting at the local level. While some Southerners viewed guerrilla warfare as an honorable tradition stretching back to the American Revolution, many others, including Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis, preferred the formal, Napoleonic style of warfare and saw guerrillas (also called "partisans" or "bushwhackers") as uncivilized. However, the Confederate war effort relied more heavily on guerrilla forces as conventional warfare failed to overcome the Union. Guerrillas protected local communities, stifled Union movements, distracted Union generals from primary objectives and produced changes in strategy, and dampened Union morale.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25026173P2'>The Confederacy's failure to meaningfully recognize or integrate these forces into their grand strategy ultimately backfired. Confederate guerrillas became increasingly ungovernable, leading to widespread lawlessness among guerillas. Some partisan forces, composed of draft dodgers and deserters, suffered disaffection with the Confederate war effort late in the war and hindered the Confederacy as much as the Union. The inability to control guerrillas sometimes led to their devastating the communities they formerly protected.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25026173P3'>Unionists throughout the South often formed their own guerrilla forces to counter both the Confederate Army and Confederate-sympathizing insurgents, leading to extremely violent clashes between local partisan companies that frequently lost sight of either national war effort. Guerrilla resistance arose most often in areas of invasion by hostile forces and thereby saw the greatest intensity in border states before trickling further south throughout the war. Irregular resistance among Unionists conversely rose in proportion to the close proximity of the Union Army. While both sides enlisted guerrilla forces into their formal armies, often calling them "partisan rangers," most guerrilla fighting remained disorganized and chaotic, though its impact on the war's outcome was immense.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
