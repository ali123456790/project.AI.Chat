                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS104425P0'>Robert Edward Lee was the Confederacy’s most famous general, commanding the primary southern army in the eastern theater from 1862 to 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P1'>Born on January 19, 1807, at Stratford Hall, Virginia, Lee was the son of a famed veteran of the American Revolution. Although his father fell into financial despair and abandoned the family, Lee maintained a good reputation and received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated second in his class in 1829 and shortly afterwards married Mary Anna Randolph Custis, the great-grand daughter of Mary Washington (George Washington’s wife). The couple eventually had seven children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P2'>Lee served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for nearly two decades before serving on the staff of General Winfield Scott during the Mexican-American War in the mid-1840s. He performed very well during the war, receiving three brevet (honorary) promotions (major, lieutenant colonel, and then colonel) for his actions Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. After the war, Lee served at various army posts before receiving an administrative position at West Point. He was the superintendent of the military academy from 1852 to 1855. He then received a field assignment as second-in-command of the Second Cavalry Regiment in Texas, under future Confederate general Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P3'>In 1857, Lee’s father-in-law passed away, leaving Lee and his wife Mary to inherit significant amounts of land—including a large plantation and home in Arlington, Virginia, across the river from Washington, D.C.—hundreds of slaves, and a large debt. Lee took time away from the military to get the properties and finances in order, which involved overseeing the work, discipline, and sale of enslaved laborers. In 1859, while in Virginia, Lee was called to lead military forces against John Brown’s abolitionists who had attacked the U.S. arsenal at Harper’s Ferry as part of an effort to spark a slave rebellion in the south. When Lee arrived, Brown’s group was surrounded in a brick building. When Brown refused orders to surrender, Lee instructed his troops to attack, and they captured Brown and killed or captured his followers within minutes. The event made national news in the already tense political battle between pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests in the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P4'>When southern states began declaring their separation from the Union following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860, Lee initially opposed secession. However, after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in April 1861, prompting Lincoln to call for volunteers to defeat the secessionists, Lee’s home state of Virginia officially joined the Confederacy. Lee was offered high ranking command in the Union, but he declined. He resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for military service within Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P5'>Lee’s first military assignment was command of Confederate troops in modern-day western Virginia. He suffered defeats in small battles there in 1861, but retained his reputation as an able officer and took a position as an advisor to Confederate president Jefferson Davis in Richmond. Then, in the summer of 1862, Lee was placed in command of an army defending the Confederate capital from Union forces, after General Joseph E. Johnston was wounded. Lee’s aggressive attacks prompted the Union army, under cautious commander General George B. McClellan, to withdraw, thereby elevating Lee’s reputation as a savior of the Confederacy. For the rest of the war, Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia were the Confederacy’s most famous and successful military force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P6'>Lee proved to be a creative commander, willing to take risks and attack aggressively to overcome his opponents’ superiority in size. Lee often chose good positions to defend, and then ordered strategic counterattacks to disrupt and defeat Union forces. Among his greatest victories were the Battle of Second Manassas in August 1862 and the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, in which he thoroughly defeated much larger Union armies through surprise flank attacks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P7'>Lee’s military gambles did not always succeed. He conducted only two offensive campaigns during the Civil War—into Maryland in September 1862 and into Pennsylvania in 1863. Both were intended to draw Union forces away from Virginia. He also hoped military victories on battlefields further north would more effectively harm the Union war effort, and possibly draw the border state of Maryland into the Confederacy. However, Lee lost both campaigns after a single major battle (Antietam in Maryland, and Gettysburg in Pennsylvania), in turn invigorating the Union war effort. President Abraham Lincoln used the Union victory of Lee at Antietam in September 1862 to announce his intention to issue an Emancipation Proclamation declaring freedom for all enslaved people within Confederate territories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P8'>By 1864, Lee had abandoned plans for offensive strategic operations. Other than ordering limited and diversionary assaults, he spent the rest of the war using the Army of Northern Virginia to defend Richmond. That spring, Ulysses S. Grant was placed in charge of Union forces in Virginia and began a stubborn advance to capture the Confederate capital. The result was a series of deadly battles in northern Virginia, followed by a lengthy stand off around Petersburg, Virginia. In the spring of 1865, Grant’s forces broke Lee’s defensive line, forcing the Confederates to abandon Richmond and retreat southward. Overwhelmed and cut off by superior numbers, Lee formally surrendered in April 1865 at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. Although not the last Confederate army to surrender, Lee’s capitulation signaled to most people in the north and south that the Confederacy had been defeated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P9'>After the war, Lee returned to Virginia. The U.S. government had confiscated his family home at Arlington and turned it into a war cemetery. Lee’s family sued the federal government and eventually received some financial compensation. The estate is now preserved by the U.S. government as Arlington National Cemetery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104425P10'>In October 1865, Lee accepted an appointment as president of Washington College (modern-day Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. His fame helped draw money to the school, and he proved to be a very capable administrator. Lee died on October 12, 1870, from complications of a stroke and pneumonia. He is entombed in the University Chapel Museum at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52703P0'>Joseph Eggleston Johnson was a career U.S. military officer who served as a general in the Confederacy during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P1'>Born near Farmville, Virginia, on February 3, 1807, Johnston attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduated in 1829. He served as a lieutenant with the Fourth U.S. Artillery in the early 1830s, eventually resigning in 1837 to pursue a career in civil engineering. After a short stint as a civilian engineer in Florida during the Second Seminole War, Johnston returned the U.S. Army and was soon after promoted to captain.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P2'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Johnston served on the personal staff of General Winfield Scott. He performed very well during the war, seeing significant combat and receiving wounds at the Battle of Cerro Gordo and at Chapultepec. Army officials issued Johnston multiple brevet (honorary) promotions for his actions during the war, leading him to holding the rank of brevet colonel. (Brevet promotions were not formally recognized in regular Army service, and Johnston returned to the official rank of captain after the Mexican War ended in 1848.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P3'>During the 1850s, Johnston petitioned for a promotion to colonel in the regular Army based upon his brevet ranks. The U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, a fellow West Point graduate, rejected the petition, but did appoint Johnston a lieutenant colonel in the First U.S. Cavalry, stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. With this unit, Johnston saw field operations against Native Americans in Wyoming Territory and was present in territorial Kansas during the battle over slavery there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P4'>In 1860, when the Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army, Brigadier General Thomas Jesup, passed away, Secretary of War John B. Floyd selected Johnston as the replacement. The appointment included a promotion to brigadier general, placing Johnston above other notable Army officers of his generation, including future Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P5'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, and Virginia declared its secession from the Union, Johnston resigned his commission. As brigadier general, Johnston was the highest ranking U.S. Army officer to resign and join the Confederacy. He initially received an appointment as major general over the Virginia militia, but soon after learned that his position would be downgraded to brigadier general in favor of Robert E. Lee filling the state militia’s sole major general position. Johnston rejected the offer from the Virginia state government and instead accepted a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate States Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P6'>Johnston organized the Army of the Shenandoah in the spring of 1861, and was the highest ranking Confederate officer at the First Battle of Bull Run in July that year. However, he deferred to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, who was more familiar with the terrain and troop dispositions around Manassas, Virginia, and thus had less to do with Confederate actions during the engagement.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P7'>Johnston was promoted to full general in August 1861, but was upset that three of his pre-war colleagues outranked him in the Confederacy. This led to friction between Johnston and President Jefferson Davis for the rest of the war. Nevertheless, Johnston was placed in command of the Army of Northern Virginia, seen by many as the most important Confederate army due to its responsibilities of protecting the Confederate capital of Richmond from Union force. In the spring of 1862, Johnston conducted a strategic retreat toward Richmond in the face of Union General George B. McClellan’s Army of the Potomac. During the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, 1862, Johnston was wounded and removed the field for treatment. General Robert E. Lee was given command of the Army of Northern Virginia, and through his aggressive and successful attacks against McClellan, Lee retained command of that army for the rest of the war.

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P8'>In November 1862, Johnston recovered from the wound received at Seven Pines and received orders to the western theater. He had nominal command over Confederates in the region, but found he had little practical control over two large armies—one led by General John C. Pemberton and the other commanded by General Braxton Bragg—already involved in campaigns in Tennessee and Mississippi. In early 1863. Johnston attempted to gather reinforcements to support Pemberton in protecting Vicksburg from Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army. Grant’s army  won a series of engagements cutting off Vicksburg from Jackson, Mississippi, blocking Johnston from uniting with Pemberton. Johnston recommended that Pemberton abandon Vicksburg to prevent his army from being surrounded by Grant. News of this recommendation upset many Confederates, including Jefferson Davis, who recognized the value of Vicksburg to controlling the Mississippi River. Pemberton’s army was indeed surrounded and captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. Davis partially blamed the loss of Vicksburg on Johnston’s failure to aggressively reinforce Pemberton, leading to additional tensions between the Confederate president and Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P9'>A few weeks later, General Bragg resigned his command of the Army of Tennessee after losing to Union forces at Chattanooga. Despite Davis’s dislike of Johnston, the Confederacy had few generals experienced or capable of leading an army. He reluctantly placed Johnston in command of the Army of Tennessee in late December 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P10'>In the spring of 1864, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman launched a campaign from Chattanooga to capture the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Johnston led his Army of Tennessee in a series of maneuvers to block the Union army. Over the next several weeks, Sherman’s larger army repeatedly attacked and flanked the Confederates, prompting Johnston to conduct a strategic withdrawal back toward Atlanta, taking new defensive positions each time. Although Johnston’s methods slowed the Union advance and inflicted more casualties on Union forces than suffered by the Confederates, Johnston retreated 110 miles in two months and failed to stop Sherman’s threat to Atlanta. Frustrated by Johnston’s perceived lack of aggression, Davis relieved Johnston of command in July 1864. His replacement, John Bell Hood, launched bold attacks against Sherman but failed, and the Confederates had to abandon Atlanta in September 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P11'>Having lost command of the Army of Tennessee, Johnston went to South Carolina to sit out the rest of the war. However, as Confederate fortunes continued to fail, numerous political leaders called for Johnston to be reinstated. President Davis vehemently opposed the recommendation, having lost faith in Johnston. Only after Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens and numerous Confederate officials tried to circumvent Davis’s authority did the president acquiesce and order Johnston to field command. In February 1865, he received control of Confederate forces in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. He consolidated his troops, but the combined force amounted only to about 25,000 soldiers. Johnston hoped to unite his force with Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia, but Lee refused. A few weeks later, in mid-April 1865, Lee was defeated by Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia, and shortly afterwards Johnston’s Confederates were finally overwhelmed by Sherman’s Union soldiers in North Carolina. During negotiations with Sherman, Johnston formally surrendered all Confederate soldiers scattered across North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida—amounting, on paper, to nearly 90,000 Confederates. It was the largest surrender of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P12'>Federal forces paroled Johnston on May 2, 1865, allowing him to return to civilian life with the promise to not take up arms against the United States. He pursued various business interests, including serving as president of the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad, and working as an insurance agent for New York Life Insurance Company. Johnston also wrote his memoirs, voicing criticism of Jefferson Davis and many other former Confederates. On the other hand, he developed a strong friendship with his former adversary, William Tecumseh Sherman. Grateful for the generous terms of surrender and respect shown to him by Sherman at the end of the war, Johnston reportedly denounced anyone who spoke ill of Sherman in his presence, and served as an honorary pallbearer at Sherman’s funeral in New York City in February 1891. Johnston became sick immediately after the funeral—possibly from exposure to cold temperatures and rain during the procession—and died of pneumonia a month later, on March 21, 1891.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52703P13'>Johnston had been married to Lydia McLane Johnston. The couple had no children, and Lydia died in 1887. Both are buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53950P0'>Richard “Dick” Taylor was Louisiana state senator and a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P1'>Born on January 27, 1826, near Louisville, Kentucky, Richard Taylor was the son of Zachary Taylor—famed Mexican-American War general and president of the United States. Richard, who went by the nickname “Dick,” attended private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts, before attending Harvard College. He transferred to Yale for his university studies and graduated in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P2'>Taylor briefly served in the Mexican-American War under his father, but left Mexico due to health problems. He traveled to Mississippi to manage a cotton plantation owned by his family, and then moved to Louisiana after he inherited a sugar plantation following his father’s death in 1850 while president. Dick Taylor expanded the size of the Louisiana plantation property and its slave population, eventually owning around two hundred enslaved people. Taylor married Louise Marie Mythe Bringer, the daughter of a wealthy family in Louisiana, and became one of the richest men in the state. In the 1855 Taylor won a seat in the Louisiana Senate as a Whig, but changed to the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigrant political party) before joining the Democratic Party by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P3'>When the deep southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Taylor opposed secession. However, he placed his loyalty behind the Confederacy at the outbreak of war and received a commission as colonel of the Ninth Louisiana Infantry Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Virginia, missing the First Battle of Bull Run at Manassas by only hours.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P4'>Taylor was promoted to brigadier general in October 1861 and commanded a brigade under Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in Virginia in 1862. He performed well in several battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including the First Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Port Republic. In June 1862, Taylor received a promotion to major general, making him the youngest officer of that rank in the Confederacy. The new rank led to a new assignment, which involved raising soldiers in western Louisiana. When he arrived there, Union forces already occupied several parts of the state. Taylor led Confederate troops in several battles against federal soldiers in Louisiana, and led raids against Ulysses S. Grant’s army and supplies during the Vicksburg campaign. In 1864, Taylor successfully repulsed Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’ Red River Campaign in Louisiana. However, Taylor believed he had lost a chance to decisively beat Banks due to decisions by Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P5'>In 1865, Taylor was briefly placed in command of the remnants of General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, after its disastrous Nashville campaign. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama on May 4, 1865, was paroled a few days later, and returned to Louisiana to find his sugar plantation destroyed. He moved his family to New Orleans and remained there through the Reconstruction period. After his wife died in 1875, Taylor moved with the couple’s three children to Winchester, Virginia. He passed away in 1870 while visiting a friend in New York City. Taylor is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25010344P0'>Edmund Kirby Smith was a veteran of the U.S. Mexican War and a Confederate Army general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P1'>Born on May 16, 1824 in St. Augustine, Florida, Smith graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York in 1845. Smith entered the U.S. Mexican War with a rank of second lieutenant in the 7th U.S. Infantry. After the war, Smith became a teacher of mathematics at West Point, and he worked as a botanist. He pursued botany throughout the rest of his life. However, in 1855, he was appointed captain of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry and was stationed in Texas, and in May 1859, he was injured while fighting the Comanche in Kansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P2'>When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Smith was a major in the U.S. Army, and he initially refused to cooperate with Texas's secession and its order for him to surrender his troops. However, in April, he resigned his commission and entered the Confederate Army with a rank of major in the regular artillery. That same day, he was transferred to a cavalry unit, carrying the rank of lieutenant colonel. By June, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and was in command of a brigade in the Army of the Shenandoah. Wounded during the First Battle of Manassas (also known as Bull Run), Smith was reassigned to the Department of Middle and East Florida until he recovered. On October 11, he returned to active duty and was promoted to the rank of major general and was made a division commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P3'>In 1862, he was reassigned to the Army of Mississippi (also known as the Army of Tennessee) and took part in the invasion of Kentucky. Smith was awarded for his leadership during the Battle of Richmond in Kentucky (August 30, 1862), and by the end of the year, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P4'>In 1863, Smith was reassigned once again, this time relocating to Shreveport, Louisiana as commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, which included Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, western Louisiana, and the western territories. This included approximately 30,000 men under his command, and after the fall of Vicksburg, Smith was essentially cut off from the rest of the Confederacy. The area became known as "Kirby Smithdom" as a nod to Smith's reputation as a military dictator. He conducted the war west of the Mississippi largely through guerilla warfare and was unable to combat the U.S. Navy's control of the Mississippi River or aid the Confederate Army in the east. In February 1864, he was promoted to the rank of general (one of seven in the Confederate Army). He surrendered his army on May 26, 1865, making him the last full general to surrender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P5'>After the war, Smith fled the country for Cuba, but he returned to the U.S. to take the oath of allegiance on November 14, 1865. Smith returned to higher education and entered the telegraph business. From 1866 to 1868, he was president of the Atlantic and Pacific telegraph company, but the company failed. Afterward, he ran a prepatory school in New Castle, Kentucky until it burned in 1870. In the 1870s, he served in leadership positions at the University of Nashville, the Montgomery Bell Academy, and the University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee, where he was a professor of mathematics and botany.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010344P6'>Smith was married to Cassie (Selden) Smith. The pair had eleven children, including five sons and six daughters who lived to adulthood. Edmund Kirby Smith died on March 22, 1893 in Sewanee, Tennessee. He was buried in the University Cemetery at Sewanee, but he also has a cenotaph in the Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99663P0'>The term "emancipation" describes "the act of freeing a person from another person's control" (Cambridge Dictionary). In the nineteenth-century United States, this term most often referred to an enslaved person's escape from their enslaver's control and legal ownership. Self-emancipation describes "the act of an enslaved person freeing him or herself from the bondage of slavery," by a variety of means legal and extralegal. (American Battlefield Trust)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P1'>Occurring throughout the nineteenth century, self-emancipation under the law took the form of an enslaved person purchasing their own freedom through wages made performing trades outside of their enslaver's property. This process most often occurred in urban areas, particularly those in coastal regions of the U.S., but state legal restrictions made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P2'>The most extreme and least common form of self-emancipation was suicide, which many enslaved people chose rather than remaining in bondage. The most frequent method of self-emancipation, especially during the American Civil War, was to escape from an enslaver's property and flee without their permission. Many notable abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman self-emancipated by running away. Running away signaled how self-emancipation caused legal emancipation for all the enslaved in the United States. During the Civil War, so many enslaved persons self-emancipated and fled to Union lines that the U.S. government had to craft a response. That response manifested first in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later in the 13th Amendment of 1865, which abolished slavery altogether. Self-emancipation became a primary way for enslaved African Americans in the antebellum U.S. to wield agency over their lives, and their efforts eventually succeeded in producing legislative emancipation from the top down.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

Operating at the national level of the Confederacy, it was the Legislative Branch of the Confederate States government responsible for making and amending laws. A bicameral body, the Confederate States Congress was divided into the upper house (Senate) and the lower house (House of Representatives). The Confederate States Congress concluded Its final session on March 18, 1865. (Avalon Project-<hi rend='italic'>Constitution of the Confederate States</hi>; March 11, 1861; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
