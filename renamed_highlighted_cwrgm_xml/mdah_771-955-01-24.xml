                    <p xml:id='OTPS55687P0'>Commonly known as the Father of the United States, George Washington was an American Founding Father, Commander of the Continental Army, and the first U.S. President.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P1'>During the Civil War, both the U.S. and the Confederacy claimed that they were preserving the ideals of the Founding Fathers, particularly George Washington. Confederates even used his image on the Great Seal of the Confederacy and on an official postage stamp, claiming that they were protecting his legacy from a radicalized north. Thomas R. R. Cobb of the Georgia delegation to the Montgomery Convention also suggested naming the new nation the “Republic of Washington,” and others claimed that they were fighting a “Second American Revolution” with Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee often celebrated as “second Washingtons.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P2'>Born on February 22, 1732 at Pope’s Creek in Westmoreland in the British colony of Virginia, George Washington became a land surveyor, receiving a surveyor’s license from the College of William &amp; Mary in 1749. He served as the surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia for one year. Washington was also a major and commander of one of Virginia’s four militia districts. This role included negotiating peace with the Iroquois Confederacy, and he was given the nickname Conotocaurius by the leader of the Iroquois.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P3'>In 1754, Washington unwittingly took responsibility for the Jumonville affair, where Washington’s men, which included Indian allies, ambushed a French detachment of around fifty men, killing the French, including their commander Joseph Coulon de Jumonviille, who was scalped. This was a key. moment in igniting the French and Indian War. Washington continued to serve in the war, commanding the Virginia Regiment as a colonel from August 1755 until his resignation in 1758. This included defending 300 miles of frontier and the expansion of his regiment from 300 to 1,000 men, which developed his skills as a leader and taught him British military tactics that would serve him many years later.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P4'>After the war, Washington returned to his Mount Vernon estate, where he married the widow Martha Dandridge Custis. By 1775, he doubled the size of his estate to 6,500 acres and was the enslaver of more than one hundred men, women, and children. He also became involved in local politics, including representing Frederick County in the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1758 to 1775. Washington was a prominent critic of British taxation and a proponent of boycotting British goods throughout this period.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P5'>During the Revolution, he was a delegate to both the First and Second Continental Congresses, and on June 15, 1775, he was unanimously elected commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Washington held the army together through incredibly difficult circumstances including a winter at Valley Forge that cost the lives of between 2,000 and 3,000 men due to lack of food, clothing, and shelter. Initially, Washington also banned the enlistment of Black soldiers, but he overturned this decision, ensuring that one-tenth of the soldiers in the Continental Army were Black by the end of the war. The war ended with Washington’s victory over the British at the siege of Yorktown in October 1781.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P6'>After the American Revolutionary War, Washington delivered his farewell address to the Army on November 2, 1783 and resigned as commander-in-chief. He returned to Mount Vernon, where he sought to turn the tide of the estate’s eleven-year-deficit run. Politically, Washington was also an advocate of a strong centralized government and expressed significant concerns over the Articles of Confederation. He attended the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, was unanimously elected to preside over the meeting, and lobbied many delegates to support the ratification of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P7'>Washington was unanimously elected first President of the United States on February 4, 1789. As the nation’s first president, he played a crucial role in defining the office of the presidency and in establishing its precedents. This included the inaugural address, messages to Congress, the role of the Cabinet, and the presidential tradition of retiring after two terms. After his Presidency, Washington returned to Mount Vernon, where he expressed his growing disillusionment over the institution of slavery and ultimately emancipated up to 124 enslaved people. He remained a committed Federalist and served as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army from July 1798 (during the Quasi-War with the French) until his death, although he did not assume a field command. He also served as chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary from 1788 until his death in 1799.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P8'>George Washington was married to Martha (Dandridge Custis) Washington, the widow of Daniel Parke Custis (married 1750 to 1757). George Washington did not have any children of his own but helped raise Martha’s son and daughter John Parke “Jacky” Custis and Martha Parke “Patsy” Custis. Washington died on December 14, 1799 in his home at Mount Vernon. He was buried in the Washington family vault at Mount Vernon, Fairfax County, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027624P0'>Daniel Webster was a lawyer, U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State (1841 to 1843 and 1850 to 1852). He was also one of the most prominent lawyers of the nineteenth century, arguing 223 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court during his career, winning approximately half. He is sometimes called the "Great Orator." Along with Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, Webster was also one of the three members of the Great Triumvirate, the three men who dominated American politics during the first half of the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027624P1'>Born on January 18, 1782 in Salisbury, Merrimack County, New Hampshire, Webster became a lawyer in 1805 and based his practice in New Hampshire. He handled over 1,700 cases over the course of a decade. In 1813, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Federalist, serving until 1817 before relocating to Boston, Massachusetts. There he began his illustrious career in arguing cases in the Supreme Court. From 1823 to 1827, Webster served a second term as a U.S. Representative. He also continued his work as a lawyer, and built a reputation for himself as a skilled orator.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027624P2'>In 1827, Webster became a U.S. Senator, serving under President Andrew Jackson during the Nullification Crisis. During this crisis, Webster publicly attacked the institution of slavery and argued against state's rights and the idea of secession. For Webster, the "union" was perpetual. Webster also helped create the Whig Party and made a reluctant run for the U.S. Presidency in 1836, although he only won the electoral votes in Massachusetts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027624P3'>In 1840, Webster left the Senate to become Secretary of State under newly elected President William Henry Harrison. As Harrison died just one month into his presidency, Webster ultimately served under President John Tyler until May 1843 when, facing pressure from fellow Whigs and Tyler over his opposition to the annexation of Texas, he resigned. As Secretary of State, Webster was also instrumental in shaping U.S. foreign policy in this period. After resigning, he turned to campaigning for fellow statesman Henry Clay for the 1844 Presidency.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027624P4'>From 1845 to 1849, Webster returned for a second term as a U.S. Senator and continued to be a vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery, declaring the institution of slavery a "great moral, social, and political evil." However, he also publicly opposed Northerners who returned enslaved runaways to the South, while also attacking any polticians who proposed secession.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027624P5'>In 1850, following the death of President Zachary Taylor, Webster became  resident Millard Fillmore's Secretary of State. From this position, he was a vocal proponent of the Compromise of 1850. In 1852, Webster made another unsuccessful run for the Whig presidential nomination, although thousands voted for him in the election.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027624P6'>Webster was married twice. His first wife was Grace (Fletcher) Webster, who died in 1828. The pair had five children. His second wife was Caroline (LeRoy) Webster, with whom he had two children. Of Daniel Webster's seven children, at least two sons and one daughter lived to adulthood. Webster died on October 24, 1852 in his home in Marshfield, Plymouth County, Massachusetts. He was buried in the Old Winslow Burying Ground in Marshfield.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS84072P0'>Absolom Madden West was a Confederate general, a Mississippi politician, railroad executive, and vice presidential candidate. Born in Alabama in 1818, West moved to Mississippi around 1837 to establish a plantation with property he acquired from federal land grants. He entered Mississippi state politics as a Whig and won a seat in the Mississippi Senate in 1847. He married Caroline O. Glover in the 1840s and the couple had four surviving children, born between 1849 and 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P1'>In 1853, he took an office job with the new Mississippi Central Railroad, gaining experience not only in railroad development but corporate and logistical operations. As a Whig, West originally opposed secession. However, after Mississippi left the Union in 1861, during the secession crisis that split the country following Abraham Lincon’s election to president in November 1860, West offered his loyalty and services to the state. He was promoted a brigadier general in the Mississippi state militia, and helped raised a regiment of volunteers. Recognizing his skill and experience in administrative and logistical work, state officials appointed him to several different managerial roles, such as quartermaster general, paymaster general, and commissary general of the militia. He made recommendations to the state legislature to improve the accounting of funds, and was the only state officer to have his accounting books in order and submitted at the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P2'>West took the role of president over the Mississippi Central Railroad around 1864. He remained in that position until around the end of the war, then returned to state politics—again serving in the Mississippi Senate—after the Illinois Central purchased the Mississippi Central. West was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the early effort by the Mississippi government in 1865 to earn readmission to the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, he was among the Mississippi delegation refused seats in Congress when Republicans in Washington, D.C., objected to Mississippi’s “Black Codes”—a series of highly discriminatory laws passed in the summer of 1865 to restrict the civil rights of African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS84072P3'>West became involved in labor rights during Reconstruction, helping form a branch of the National Labor Union. Reentering the Mississippi Senate in the early 1870s, around 1876 he broke away from the Democratic Party and joined the emerging “Greenback Party”—an independent, anti-monopoly political party. It united many state-level politicians in the north and the south on economic matters, namely the expansion of paper currency believed to help farmers and small businesses. Attesting to the party’s ability to bring former enemies together, the party’s national convention in 1884 nominated former Union general Benjamin Butler (who had been despised within the Confederacy during his occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War) for its presidential candidate and the former Confederate militia general West as vice president. The party polled only a 1.7% of the popular vote in 1884.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99663P0'>The term "emancipation" describes "the act of freeing a person from another person's control" (Cambridge Dictionary). In the nineteenth-century United States, this term most often referred to an enslaved person's escape from their enslaver's control and legal ownership. Self-emancipation describes "the act of an enslaved person freeing him or herself from the bondage of slavery," by a variety of means legal and extralegal. (American Battlefield Trust)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P1'>Occurring throughout the nineteenth century, self-emancipation under the law took the form of an enslaved person purchasing their own freedom through wages made performing trades outside of their enslaver's property. This process most often occurred in urban areas, particularly those in coastal regions of the U.S., but state legal restrictions made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P2'>The most extreme and least common form of self-emancipation was suicide, which many enslaved people chose rather than remaining in bondage. The most frequent method of self-emancipation, especially during the American Civil War, was to escape from an enslaver's property and flee without their permission. Many notable abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman self-emancipated by running away. Running away signaled how self-emancipation caused legal emancipation for all the enslaved in the United States. During the Civil War, so many enslaved persons self-emancipated and fled to Union lines that the U.S. government had to craft a response. That response manifested first in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later in the 13th Amendment of 1865, which abolished slavery altogether. Self-emancipation became a primary way for enslaved African Americans in the antebellum U.S. to wield agency over their lives, and their efforts eventually succeeded in producing legislative emancipation from the top down.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92926P0'>During the Civil War, Confederate military authorities used different levels of operational command to oversee their growing military forces and to respond to federal campaigns against the south. The military department proved to be one of the more effective levels of command for territorial areas. The department commanders reported directly to the Confederate War Department and Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Initially Confederate officials created military departments only for areas directly under federal attack. As the war developed, they created departments to cover the entire Confederacy. Confederate authorities restructured the departments as the war developed, and Union forces captured some parts of the Confederacy or military campaigns created new military needs in geographical areas. Some old departments were dissolved, or divided, and territories placed within new departments designed for contemporary needs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92926P1'>The first department to include parts of Mississippi was the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, established on October 1, 1862. It existed until January 28, 1864, when Confederate authorities created the new department of Alabama and East Mississippi. That department lasted until August 15, 1864, and the creation of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana, which lasted until May 1865 and the end of the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32027623P0'>The office of Quartermaster General was primarily responsible for the acquisition, development, and dispersal of food and uniforms within the army. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Union and Confederate officials had to expand the Quartermaster capabilities and structure to support the massive size and dispersion of military forces. State militaries in the south, like in Mississippi, also rapidly grew in response to the war, requiring a quartermaster system beyond what existed within the militia systems before the war. The state quartermasters struggled to acquire and distribute sufficient supplies to state military forces, in large part due to competition with the Confederate military for resources and personnel. Despite these challenges, quartermaster personnel during the Civil War were usually able to provide sufficient food and uniforms to keep troops effective in the field. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63104P0'>The Whig Party was a national political party in the United States from 1833 to 1860. During its roughly twenty-five years of existence, it stood as one of two major political parties (the other being the Democratic Party) that dominated American national politics. Four U.S. presidents were elected as Whig candidates, and several leading American congressmen and statesmen identified as Whigs. The party generally opposed aggressive American expansion westward, and denounced the Mexican War. Whigs supported protective tariffs, federal support for infrastructure, and the national bank.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63104P1'>The Whig Party, like the Democratic Party, had members across the United States. It struggled to remain united during debates over slavery. Northern Whigs tended to be more hostile to slavery than northern Democrats, and the overtly anti-slavery parties, such as the Free Soil Party, in the late 1840s and early 1850s were primarily made up of former Whigs. After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved restrictions against slavery in the territories, thousands of northern Whigs, disgruntled northern Democrats, and Free Soil members formed the Republican Party as a major national political organization. The Whig Party remained cohesive enough to put a candidate on the 1856 presidential ballot, but the results of that election proved that the Republican Party had supplanted the Whigs in political power. The Whig Party fell apart over the next few years, in large part because Republicans adopted many of the Whig Party’s economic policies. Conservative Whigs in the south tried to inhabit a middle ground during the contentious 1860 presidential debate by forming the Constitutional Union Party that opposed secession and avoided taking sides on the slavery debate. This effort meant the end of the Whig Party as a viable party in American politics. (Wikipedia)
