                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53950P0'>Richard “Dick” Taylor was Louisiana state senator and a general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P1'>Born on January 27, 1826, near Louisville, Kentucky, Richard Taylor was the son of Zachary Taylor—famed Mexican-American War general and president of the United States. Richard, who went by the nickname “Dick,” attended private schools in Kentucky and Massachusetts, before attending Harvard College. He transferred to Yale for his university studies and graduated in 1845.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P2'>Taylor briefly served in the Mexican-American War under his father, but left Mexico due to health problems. He traveled to Mississippi to manage a cotton plantation owned by his family, and then moved to Louisiana after he inherited a sugar plantation following his father’s death in 1850 while president. Dick Taylor expanded the size of the Louisiana plantation property and its slave population, eventually owning around two hundred enslaved people. Taylor married Louise Marie Mythe Bringer, the daughter of a wealthy family in Louisiana, and became one of the richest men in the state. In the 1855 Taylor won a seat in the Louisiana Senate as a Whig, but changed to the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigrant political party) before joining the Democratic Party by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P3'>When the deep southern states began seceding following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Taylor opposed secession. However, he placed his loyalty behind the Confederacy at the outbreak of war and received a commission as colonel of the Ninth Louisiana Infantry Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Virginia, missing the First Battle of Bull Run at Manassas by only hours.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P4'>Taylor was promoted to brigadier general in October 1861 and commanded a brigade under Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson in Virginia in 1862. He performed well in several battles in the Shenandoah Valley, including the First Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Port Republic. In June 1862, Taylor received a promotion to major general, making him the youngest officer of that rank in the Confederacy. The new rank led to a new assignment, which involved raising soldiers in western Louisiana. When he arrived there, Union forces already occupied several parts of the state. Taylor led Confederate troops in several battles against federal soldiers in Louisiana, and led raids against Ulysses S. Grant’s army and supplies during the Vicksburg campaign. In 1864, Taylor successfully repulsed Union general Nathaniel P. Banks’ Red River Campaign in Louisiana. However, Taylor believed he had lost a chance to decisively beat Banks due to decisions by Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53950P5'>In 1865, Taylor was briefly placed in command of the remnants of General John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee, after its disastrous Nashville campaign. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama on May 4, 1865, was paroled a few days later, and returned to Louisiana to find his sugar plantation destroyed. He moved his family to New Orleans and remained there through the Reconstruction period. After his wife died in 1875, Taylor moved with the couple’s three children to Winchester, Virginia. He passed away in 1870 while visiting a friend in New York City. Taylor is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).
