                    <p xml:id='OTPS32023233P0'>Charles A. Sullivan was a politician in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32023233P1'>Born in 1835 in Tennessee, Sullivan moved to Mississippi as a child with his family. He studied and law and became a practicing attorney in Greensboro, Mississippi, during the 1850s. Sullivan became active in Mississippi state politics as a Republican in the late 1860s, and served in the state senate in the early 1870s. As a state senator, he served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and was temporarily president pro tem of senate. He resigned from the senate in 1874 and became chancellor of Mississippi’s Fifth District.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32023233P2'>Aside from his political and legal work, Sullivan reportedly worked to design the world’s first flying machine. In 1879, while living in Starkville, he claimed to have invented an aerial vehicle sixty feet long and fourteen feet wide capable of flying two hundred feet high and up to sixty-five miles per hour. Sullivan supposedly filed a request to the U.S. Patent Office to protect his intellectual property rights as he tested the design. In 1880, he campaigned to raise $4,000 to fund the construction of two of his flying machines, with promises to fly from New York to Liverpool, England. Little else was heard from Sullivan of his proposed invention, and his appeals for funding may not have generated much support, as the editor of <hi rend='italic'>The Brookhaven Ledger</hi> wrote dryly, “We think he can be gotten rid of for less than $4,000.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32023233P3'>Sullivan died in 1882, around the age of 47. He was married to Mariah Farwell of Massachusetts and had as many as five children. Sullivan is buried in Odd Fellows Cemetery in Starkville, Mississippi.

On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P0'>A Unionist was "a member or supporter of the twenty-three Northern states that were not part of the seceding Confederacy during the American Civil War" (Wikipedia). Unionism in the South took on a variety of forms and encompassed many different beliefs. While most northerners sided with the Union, many southerners did as well. Even prior to secession, no solid white South existed, as many white southerners in mountainous and upcountry areas of the South did not own enslaved persons. While some areas like eastern Tennessee and parts of northern Alabama rejected secession outright for the entire war, secession produced renewed patriotism for many non-enslaving whites in the South. That patriotism faltered for many as the awful realities of wartime violence and poverty struck even as early as 1861. Many poor white southerners viewed the Confederacy's conscription, impressment, and taxation policies as elitist, forcing many families to, if not support the Union per se, at least oppose the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P1'>Entire unionist communities developed throughout the war to shield those loyal to the Union or opposed to the Confederacy, as well as deserters from the Confederate Army and, in certain cases, escaped enslaved persons. Southern unionism often led to internal armed conflict between southerners, as bands of guerilla fighters raided Confederate depots and shipping for supplies and even attacked some Confederate units. While unionist strongholds most frequently developed in the mountainous regions of the South and the border states, Unionism spread throughout the entire Confederacy, including one of the most notable in Jones County, Mississippi, where ex-Confederate soldier Newton Knight and roughly 500 others formed the so-called "Free State of Jones" and opposed Confederate forces until the war's end. The presence of Unionism across the South stifled the Confederate war effort in many ways and revealed that tensions of national loyalty, race, class, and gender remained complicated even for southern whites (American Heritage; Essential Civil War Curriculum).
