                    <p xml:id='OTPS62969P0'>William Henry Seward was a politician from New York who served as United States Secretary of State during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P1'>Born in Florida, New York, on May 16, 1801, Seward was educated at local schools and graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York, in 1820. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in Auburn, New York. Soon afterwards, he became involved in politics. He joined the Whig Party and won a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1830. He proved quite popular within the Whig Party and received the party’s nomination for governor of New York in 1834. He lost the election and resumed practicing law in Auburn, New York, but retained his standing with the party. Four years later, Seward won the 1838 gubernatorial election and served as governor until 1842. In office, Seward proved sympathetic to African American residents of New York, signing several laws that protected Black rights. He also supported laws that gave fugitive slaves who fled to the state from the south right to jury trials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P2'>Upon leaving the governor’s office, Seward returned to practicing law in Auburn. In 1849, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and became a leading anti-slavery voice in Washington, D.C. In the mid-1850s, with the slavery debate dominating national politics and leading to the dissolution of the Whig Party, Seward joined the new Republican Party. His long history of anti-slavery advocacy and stellar political resume made him a top contender for the Republican Party’s nomination for president in 1860. However, he lost the nomination to Abraham Lincoln, whose western roots and more moderate anti-slavery reputation appealed to more Republicans. Additionally, Seward’s previous political support of immigrant rights and association with infamous political boss Thurlow Weed in New York were unpopular among many Republicans and worked against his nomination.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P3'>Seward was initially dismissive of Lincoln, due to the latter's unrefined background and mannerisms, and his political inexperience. (Lincoln’s previous time in Washington, D.C., amounted to a single term in the U.S. House of Representatives in the late 1840s.) However, Seward backed Lincoln as the party candidate during the 1860 presidential election. When Lincoln won the presidency, he selected Seward for U.S. Secretary of State.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P4'>During the secession crisis that followed the 1860 election, Seward used his political connections in a vain effort to prevent southern states from seceding and to facilitate peace within the already contentious situation. He took a stronger public position during the crisis than Lincoln, who remained relatively quiet during the period between the election in November 1860 and inauguration in March 1861. Seward generally supported Lincoln’s policies, and the two privately coordinated many of Seward’s actions in response to secession, but Seward privately believed he would be a guiding figure for the new president in the upcoming administration. Additionally, Seward overestimated the power he would hold over Lincoln in regards to foreign affairs. Despite his overestimation of his influence, and his doubts of Lincoln’s abilities, Seward’s opinion of the president changed as the war progressed. By the summer of 1861, Seward privately praised Lincoln as calm, measured, and a quick learner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P5'>Lincoln and Seward worked well together, with the president respecting his secretary’s suggestions regarding policy and political timing. For example, in the summer of 1862, when Lincoln privately informed his cabinet that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation—declaring that all slaves in Confederate areas would be considered free by federal authorities—Seward urged cautioned. Seward’s anti-slavery sentiments were beyond reproach, but he argued that that the public would interpret a bold executive action as desperation by an administration losing the war. Seward advised Lincoln to wait and announce it after a great Union military victory. Lincoln agreed with this advice and held on to the proclamation for nearly two months, until Union forces defeated Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Antietam, Maryland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P6'>Preventing foreign interference in the Civil War was among Seward’s most important jobs. He proved more aggressive in his opposition to European countries who flirted with the idea of supporting the Confederacy. Lincoln took a more moderate stance, determined to avoid going to war with a foreign power while in the midst of fighting the Confederacy. Ultimately, Seward helped present a strong and determined U.S. government dedicated to defeating secession and, after the announcement of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, ending slavery, which kept Britain and France officially neutral.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P7'>On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth shot and mortally wounded President Lincoln at a play in Washington, D.C. Simultaneously, an associate of Booth, named Lewis Powell, tried to assassinate Seward. The secretary of state was bedridden at his townhouse in Washington, D.C., with a broken jaw following a carriage accident. Powell gained access into Seward’s home by claiming to have medicine. Seward’s son Frederick stopped Powell inside the house and asked for the medicine. Powell drew a revolver and tried to shoot the young man. The gun misfired, so Powell hit Frederick in the head with the handgun, stunning him, and rushed into Seward’s room. He attacked Seward, who was laying on his bed, with a knife, stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck. A Union soldier and another of Seward’s sons, Augustus, who were in the room charged Powell and eventually forced him to run from the house. In total, five men were wounded by Powell during the attack—Seward, two of his sons, the military guard, and a messenger who Powell stabbed while running out of the house. They all survived. Seward was badly wounded, but a metal brace supporting his face and neck deflected Powell’s slashes, preventing any of his injuries from being mortal. Powell was subsequently found and arrested by military authorities. He was executed on July 7, 1865, by hanging with three other people convicted of plotting or aiding in the assassination of Lincoln and other federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P8'>Seward’s recovery took several weeks, at which time Vice President Andrew Johnson took Lincoln’s place in the White House. When he returned to his duties, he tried to maintain a good working relationship with Johnson, but found himself defending the increasingly unpopular president against radicals within the Republican Party. Seward’s most notable act as secretary of state after the Civil War was his purchase of Alaska territory from Russia in 1867. He negotiated the entire purchase for $7.2 million (roughly $120 million today). Initially lambasted by political rivals as “Seward’s Folly,” who complained that the secretary of state had spent millions of dollars on distant section of undeveloped land while the country still had numerous western territories, attitudes changed within a few years when prospectors fond gold in Alaska and many other settlers learned of the great natural resources there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P9'>Seward’s tenure as secretary of state ended with the inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant as president in 1869. He retired from public office and traveled around the world. Three years later, on October 10, 1872, he died, only hours after first complaining of shortness of breath. He had been married to Frances Adeline Miller, who had passed away in 1865. The couple had six children. Seward is buried at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25005902P0'>Benjamin Franklin Butler was a lawyer, U.S. Representative, major general in the U.S. Army during the Civil War, and Governor of Massachusetts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P1'>Born on November 5, 1818 in Deerfield, Rockingham County, New Hampshire, Butler moved to Lowell, Massachusetts with his family in 1828. In 1840, he became a lawyer and opened a law firm in Lowell, where he became a prominent defense lawyer and was a specialist in bankruptcy law. He was so successful that he opened up a second practice in Boston and purchased shares in Lowell’s Middlesex Mill Company. Butler was also a member of the state militia, carrying the rank of brigadier general just before the Civil War. A member of the Democratic Party, Butler opposed the abolitionist movement, and he became a Massachusetts state representative in 1852, serving one term. In 1858, he was elected to the state senate. He also unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1859 and 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P2'>During the Civil War, Butler secured a contract with the state of Massachusetts for his mill to supply heavy cloth to the militia, guaranteeing himself significant profits. He also was appointed brigadier general of the state militia and was sent to Maryland with the 8th Volunteer Massachusetts (militia) to help secure the state. Afterwards, he was appointed major general of the volunteer forces and was sent to the Department of Virginia. There, he established a precedent for the U.S. Army by refusing to return fugitive slaves to their enslavers, claiming that they were contraband of war. Lincoln supported the argument, and the policy eventually became standard U.S. policy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P3'>On June 10, 1861, Butler suffered an embarrassing defeat at the Battle of Big Bethel, and his command was reduced in size. But, he found more success in North Carolina and was assigned to command ground troops in Louisiana in November. In May 1862, Butler commanded the troops that took New Orleans after the U.S. Navy defeated the Confederates at Forts Jackson and St. Philip south of the city.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P4'>Among Confederates, Butler became infamous as the military governor of New Orleans. On May 15, 1862, he issued General Order No. 28, which was a response to the verbal and physical abuse U.S. officers and soldiers had experienced at the hands of “respectable” women in New Orleans. This included women spitting in the faces of U.S. soldiers, pouring chamber pots filled with human excrement on men on patrol, and even an incident involving U.S. Naval commander Admiral David Farragut in which a woman poured urine on his head. General Order No. 28 declared that any woman who insulted or showed contempt for an officer or soldier of the U.S. would be treated as a “woman of the town plying her avocation” (as a sex worker). This earned him the nicknames “Beast Butler” and “Butler the Beast.” Butler also seized cotton from those who failed to pledge their loyalty to the U.S. both in the city and in the surrounding areas. The cotton was auctioned at low prices, and his brother Andrew was often the buyer. Other acts included censoring New Orleans newspapers and executing William Mumford, who tore down a U.S. flag that had been placed on the U.S. Mint in New Orleans. Mumford had dragged the flag through the streets, where it was spit on, trampled on, and torn into pieces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P5'>Butler did also provide relief for the poor and implemented strict quarantines that protected the city from yellow fever. Northerners saw his governance as an appropriately firm stance against Confederates. In September 1862, he also formed the 1st Louisiana Native Guard, which was the first Black regiment in the U.S. Army, and he commissioned thirty Black officers to command the unit, whereas most Black regiments were commanded by white officers. However, Lincoln authorized Butler’s recall in December 1862.

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P6'>Afterwards, Butler joined the Republican Party, and in November 1863, he became the commander of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina. By May 1864, his forces were called the Army of the James. This included several regiments of the U.S. Colored Troops (USCT), and he awarded the Medal of Honor to several Black men of the 38th USCT. He also created a special medal for meritorious service which he awarded to another two hundred Black men. This was later named the Butler Medal. As commander of the Army of the James, Butler also had an opportunity to take Petersburg in May 1864, which may have forced the Confederates to surrender a year early. But he hesitated, allowing the Confederates to build up a more substantial force. As in New Orleans, Butler’s command was also tarnished by financial scandal and even of trade with the Confederacy. However, his popularity with the Radical Republicans and concerns that he might run for the presidency ensured he did not lose his position in the army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P7'>In December 1864, Butler suffered another embarrassment in which he deemed Fort Fisher in North Carolina impregnable. The U.S. Army captured the fort a week later without Butler in command. On January 8, 1865, with Lincoln’s reelection to the presidency secure, U.S. General Ulysses S. Grant relieved Butler of his command.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P8'>Between his mills in Lowell and his time in New Orleans, Butler was enormously wealthy after the war, but he returned to his law practice, expanding his firm to include offices in New York City and Washington D.C. He was the defense attorney in some of the most prominent cases in the years immediately following the war. In 1866, he was also elected U.S. Representative on a platform of civil rights, serving through 1875 and again 1877 to 1879. Butler was an opponent to U.S. President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, and he was an early advocate for impeaching the President. He was elected by the House to serve as one of the prosecutors in the impeachment trial. The impeachment failed by a single vote.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P9'>In 1882, Butler was elected Governor of Massachusetts, serving one term from 1883 to 1884. By this point, he had rejoined the Democratic Party. After his term, he made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Presidency, and by 1892, he published his memoir <hi rend='italic'>Butler’s Book</hi>.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25005902P10'>Butler was married to Sarah Jones (Hildreth) Butler, who preceded him in death in 1876. The pair had two sons and one daughter who lived to adulthood. His daughter was Blanche (Butler) Ames, who was the wife of Mississippi Governor Adelbert Ames. Benjamin Franklin Butler died on January 11, 1893 in Washington D.C. and was buried in the Hildreth Family Cemetery in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32026703P0'>The United States Congress General Amnesty Act (1865) was enacted by President Andrew Johnson on May 29, 1865, giving amnesty (or an official pardon) to former Confederates who participated in the Civil War following an oath of allegiance to the United States and the acceptance of the abolition of enslavement. This act excluded high-ranking military leaders and officials, as well as those who committed war crimes. Johnson believed that amnesty was the surest way to rebuild the nation and the General Amnesty Act was one part of his Reconstruction Plan. This act was welcomed by many Northerners who wanted to move on from the Civil War, but was criticized by many radicals who felt the act was too lenient on Confederate actors and wanted those people excluded from society and punished for their actions in the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

<p corresp='TTP32192421P2' xml:id='OTP32192421P2'>My Dear Sir
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32192421P3' xml:id='OTP32192421P3'>The <rs ref='#S99620'>newspapers</rs> announce that preliminary to the action of the <rs ref='#S52439'>President</rs>, under his <rs ref='#S32026703'>Proclamation</rs> of May 29<add place='above'>th</add>, it is proper that the Governor of the State in which the applicant resides, should sanction the appeal. It is on this account, and by reason of our former acquaintance, that I venture thus to trespass on your attention.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32192421P4' xml:id='OTP32192421P4'>You may possibly be aware of my antecedents, and that in common with my associates in Adams County, I was decided in resisting nullification more than 30 years ago. My sentiments did not change, and in 1861 I was equally firm in opposing <rs ref='#S71100'>secession</rs>—that unfortunately for our Country, and even for the instigators themselves

          <p corresp='TTP32192423P0' xml:id='OTP32192423P0'>the exertions of those with whom I acted, were unsuccessful—secession was accomplished, more by audacity than by numbers. I yielded to a force which I could not resist, &amp; obeyed the Government <hi rend='underline'>de facto</hi>.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32192423P1' xml:id='OTP32192423P1'>But, as you will see by a copy of my return under the orders of Genl <rs ref='#S25005902'>Butler</rs>, I declined to take the oath to the Confederacy, attached myself to no association, refused all office, &amp; did nothing to compromise my fealty to the United States, <hi rend='underline'>except</hi> to give my money when it was demanded. Could I have done less? [gap] Moreover, I refused to illuminate my house, when <rs ref='#S63017'>Neworleans</rs> blared with light, in commemoration of secession. I visited several times the <rs ref='#S57050'>prisoners of war</rs>, of whom 500 were <rs ref='#S69535'>con-fined</rs> then, gave money to the officers, and to all, molasses, rice, tobacco, books and various other little things that might and did promote their comfort. For such

<p corresp='TTP32192423P2' xml:id='OTP32192423P2'>acts, for the expression of my opinions, and for my exertions to relieve those who were harshly treated, threatening letters were addressed to me, and I was denounced by the Press. After the reoccupation of N. Orleans by the forces of the U. S. my intercourse with General Butler &amp; Adm<add place='above'>l</add> <rs ref='#S32027978'>Farragut</rs> was constant and cordial,—as it continues, even now.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32192423P3' xml:id='OTP32192423P3'>The only offence with which I am charged, as far as I know, is, that I refused to take the oath enjoined by Gen<add place='above'>l</add> Butler in Sept. 1862. For this <hi rend='underline'>contumacy</hi> as he was pleased to term it, my property in N. O. was sequestered, and my name placed in the list of registered enemies of the U. S.—with what justice you can decide by a reference to my <hi rend='underline'>Return</hi>, the offence for which I was punished. I refused to comply with General Butler's order, because I felt conscious that I had never forfeited my allegiance to the U. S., and to have done so would have ensured the confiscation

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32192425P1' xml:id='OTP32192425P1'>Such in brief, have been my course and the penalty imposed on me. My name has long since been erased from the List of Registered enemies, but not till I had been banished from Neworleans, <rs ref='#S96659'>impoverished</rs>, in my old age. In reviewing my course dispassion-ately, I have nothing to reproach myself with. It is not therefore for <rs ref='#S62927'><hi rend='underline'>pardon</hi></rs> I apply, but for <hi rend='underline'>justice</hi>. If if I have violated my duty to our Common Country, which I have sincerely loved, I will not shrink from the penalty legally imposed. But now I am suffering by the exercise of military power without being allowed to defend myself. "Strike, but hear me." Heretofore I have enjoyed the character of an honest man. If you believe my representation to be correct, or if on examination you find it to be so,

In the course of nature, I can have but little longer to live. It would embitter my last moments to descend into the tomb with my name branded by the imputation of infidelity to a Constitution and Government, under which I had served for many years in my youth, and had enjoyed a greater degree of prosperity than falls to the lot of most men.
