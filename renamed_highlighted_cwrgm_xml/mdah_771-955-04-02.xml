                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52495P0'>Samuel Russell Thomas was a Union officer during the Civil War and a Freedmen’s Bureau official in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P1'>Born on April 27, 1840, in South Point, Ohio, Thomas worked for the Keystone Iron Company as a young man and initially studied mining. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Union military service, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Twenty-seventh Ohio Infantry Regiment. He was repeatedly promoted, eventually reaching the rank of colonel and then the brevet (honorary) rank of general. Thomas participated in several battles in the western theater, including Shiloh, Vicksburg, and Chattanooga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P2'>At the end of the Civil War, Thomas initially remained in the army, serving as a staff officer under General Oliver O. Howard, who was commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandon Lands (or Freedmen’s Bureau). Thomas oversaw much of the bureau’s work in Mississippi during the first two years after the war. He mustered out of the army in early 1867 and returned to Ohio, where he found success in industrial development, including the manufacturing of pig iron, mining coal, and then constructing railroads. He served as an executive in several railroad companies during the late nineteenth century.

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P3'>Thomas died on January 11, 1903. He was married to Ann Porter and had three children. He is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56834P0'>Edwin McMasters Stanton was an attorney and politician who served as the U.S. secretary of war during the Civil War and Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P1'>Born on December 19, 1814, in Steubenville, Ohio, Stanton was educated at various private schools and academies, and attended Kenyon College before leaving due to lack of money. He developed an opposition to slavery at a young age, but also became a strong supporter of southerner Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. Stanton began pursuing a career in law shortly after leaving college and studied under an attorney in Steubenville. He became a practicing attorney in 1835 and joined a prominent law firm in Cadiz, Ohio, becoming one its primary trial lawyers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P2'>In 1838, one of Stanton’s law partners—Benjamin Tappan—won election to the U.S. Senate. Stanton oversaw the law firm in Tappan’s absence and became more active in politics in his own right. He gained fame in 1845 from his defense of Caleb McNulty, a Democrat and clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, who had been charged with embezzling tens of thousands of dollars. Stanton successfully got the charges dropped through the clever use of legal technicalities. Wide newspaper reporting of the proceedings broadcast Stanton’s name across a wide area.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P3'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Stanton considered enlisting in the military. However, he was a lifelong sufferer of asthma, and physicians warned him that such action could prove detrimental to his health or life. Instead, he expanded his legal practice into Virginia and Pennsylvania, and established a new office in Pittsburgh. His prominence as an attorney spread, in part due to his role in arguing cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1857, the U.S. attorney general asked Stanton to represent the U.S. government during a dispute over land claims in California. After a lengthy journey by ship, he spent months investigating documents in California and successfully proved that several claims by foreign parties were fraudulent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P4'>During the 1860 presidential election, Stanton publicly chose to support the southern Democratic candidate, John C. Breckinridge, over the national Democratic candidate (and northerner) Stephen Douglas. The decision was partly based upon his belief that Breckinridge’s victory would prevent southern secession, but Douglas and Stanton had also been at odds over political matters in the past. When Abraham Lincoln won the election, and southern states began declaring secession, outgoing president James Buchanan appointed Stanton U.S. attorney general. The appointment took place in December 1860, and only lasted until Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861, but it allowed Stanton to be directly involved in trying to prevent the country from breaking apart.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P5'>Stanton strongly opposed secession, and he believed Buchanan was too compliant to southern demands. He and Secretary of State Jeremiah Black advised against withdrawing federal soldiers from Fort Sumter in South Carolina, threatening to resign their posts if the president made such decision. The effort worked, and Buchanan agreed to stand firm on the U.S. Army’s hold on the fort in Charleston Harbor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P6'>When Lincoln was inaugurated, Stanton was replaced as attorney general. He remained in Washington, D.C., to help the new cabinet transition, and he made a good impression on some of the incoming secretaries. When Lincoln’s original secretary of war, Simon Cameron, resigned in late 1861, the Secretary of State William H. Seward and Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase recommended Stanton as the replacement. Lincoln agreed, and on January 15, 1862, Stanton was sworn in as the U.S. secretary of war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P7'>Stanton proved to be a very effective administrator as secretary of war. He oversaw the massive increase in the Union army, and a war effort that spanned from Kansas to Washington, D.C., and then into the Confederacy, over four years of bloody fighting. This involved improving communication and transportation networks, and maintaining determination in the face of several Union battlefield defeats. Although Stanton did not have a high reputation of Lincoln at first, the secretary of war became one of the president’s fiercest and most loyal defenders as the war progressed. Although intending to retire from the cabinet at the end of the war, Lincoln’s assassination sparked an intense energy in Stanton, and he practically took control of the Republican administration. He oversaw the federal effort to capture and punish the people involved in Lincoln’s assassination, and took a hardline position on punishing the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P8'>When Vice President Andrew Johnson was sworn in as president, following Lincoln’s death, he and Stanton established an uneasy relationship. Soon, they clashed over Reconstruction policies. Johnson took a more lenient approach to former Confederates while Stanton wanted federal occupation to oversee much of the rebuilding and restructuring of southern society. By late 1867, the rift led the president to remove Stanton from his cabinet position. Republicans in Congress backed Stanton, and in January 1868 the U.S. Senate reinstated him as secretary of war. Johnson continued his efforts to remove Stanton, leading to Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives moving to impeach Johnson. The president barely survived the impeachment conviction in the U.S. Senate, but his political power within the Republican Party was essentially over.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P9'>Stanton resigned from his position as secretary of war in May 1868. He returned to practicing law but did provide some public support for Republican candidates, including Ulysses S. Grant’s run for president, in the election that year. In late 1869, Grant offered him an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. He accepted and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on December 20. However, Stanton—whose health was already failing—died before he could take his seat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P10'>Stanton was married twice, first to Mary Lamson, who died in 1844. His second wife was Ellen Hutchison. He had at least seven children. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32028021P0'>Henry Warner Slocum was a Union general during the Civil War and a U.S. congressman from New York.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P1'>Born on September 24, 1827, in Delphi Falls, New York, he proved an intelligent and studious individual, earning a teaching certificate at the age of 16. After teaching for a few years, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1852. Slocum served for four years in the U.S. Army, participating in the Third Seminole War in Florida before resigning his commission in 1856 and moving to Syracuse, New York. He studied law for two years, and then was admitted as a practicing attorney in Syracuse in 1858. Within a year, Slocum was elected county treasurer and then was elected to the New York State Assembly.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Slocum volunteered for Union military service. He received a commission as colonel in command of the Twenty-Seventh New York Infantry Regiment. He led that unit during the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, receiving a severe wound. When he recovered enough to return to field service, Slocum was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of a brigade in the Army of the Potomac. By May 1862, he was in command of a division and led it with distinction during the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond, Virginia, receiving high praise from Union officers. In July 1862, at the age of 34, he was promoted to major general. He continued to perform well in battle, playing a conspicuous role in the Battle of South Mountain in September 1862 and the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P3'>Slocum played a vital, but somewhat unappreciated, role at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. On July 2, when ordered to relocate his XII Corps south in response to a Confederate assault on the Union left flank, Slocum wisely recognized the risk such move would cause to the Union army’s right flank at Culp’s Hill. He ordered one of his brigades to remain in defense of that position, which likely saved the Union Army from defeat at Gettysburg when that brigade repelled a massive Confederate assault upon Culp’s Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P4'>In the fall of 1863, Slocum was transferred to the western theater. He initially received command of a division tasked with protecting the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. However, in the summer of 1864, he received command of the XVII Corps in Tennessee and the District of Vicksburg. General Ulysses S. Grant was so impressed with Slocum’s management of the Vicksburg district that he wished to keep him in that position and delayed Slocum’s reassignment to field command in Georgia. Eventually, though, Slocum joined William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union force during the campaign for Atlanta, taking command of the XX Corps. He effectively led the corps during the campaign, resulting in his troops being the first to march into Atlanta when the city surrendered in. September 1864. He was then placed in charge of Union occupation forces in Atlanta for more than two months, showing compassion and efficiency in his duties.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P5'>Slocum received command of the Army of Georgia and supported Sherman’s march across Georgia to Savannah. His army did not see any major engagements during that campaign, but did see intense action in the subsequent Carolinas Campaign. When the Civil War ended in 1865, Slocum was among the most successful and respected Union generals.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P6'>Shortly after hostilities ended, Slocum resigned from the army and turned to civilian life. He unsuccessfully ran for the Secretary of State position in New York, then began a law practice. In 1868, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat and served two terms. After practicing law in the 1870s he again won a congressional seat in 1882 and served a single term. During his time in public office and as an attorney, Slocum was active in promoting infrastructure development in New York, including the construction and expansion of street cars and bridges.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P7'>Slocum died on April 14, 1894. He was married to Carolina A. Rice and had three children. Slocum is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS106232P0'>Thomas Alexander Marshall was a lawyer in Vicksburg, Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS106232P1'>Born on March 30, 1812 in Augusta, Kentucky, Marshall moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi in 1837. He was a lawyer, partnered with William C. Smedes in Vicksburg, Mississippi by 1838. Marshall continued practicing law throughout the 1840s and 1850s and was parterned with Horace Miller at some point before the Civil War. Marshall was also the president of the Southern Railroad by 1853, and he served at least one term in the Mississippi state legislature. Although Marshall was an enslaver of at least nine men, women, and children in 1860, he voted against secession.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS106232P2'>After the Civil War, Marshall was appointed Chief Justice of the Mississippi Court of Appeals in 1866, but by 1869, he resumed his law practice. Partnering with his son Martin Marshall, he opened a law firm called T. A. and M. Marshall. Thomas Alexander Marshall continued practicing law until his health declined in the 1880s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS106232P3'>Marshall was married to Letiticia (Miller) Marshall, who preceded him in death in 1887. The pair had between ten and twelve children, including four sons and six daughters who lived to adulthood. Thomas Alexander Marshall died on December 21, 1893 in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99399P0'>Plantations are farms that typically grow cash crops, and often specialize in a single product, such as cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane. Plantation farming continues in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century, especially for crops like coffee beans, rubber trees, and cocoa. In American history the term plantation is most often associated with estates in the American south. Historical descriptions of plantations generate images of large farming operations. However, even moderately-sized southern farms that planted cash crops were sometimes referred to as plantations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P1'>Southern plantations before the Civil War were strongly tied to the institution of slavery. As profit-driven agricultural operations, plantations required large numbers of laborers. This fed the demand for African slave importation to the British colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and bolstered the defense of slavery among southern planters in the nineteenth century. Plantation crops varied by region within the south, with rice being popular in Georgia and South Carolina along the Atlantic coast, tobacco being an early cash crop in Virginia, and then—after the invention of the cotton gin at the end of the eighteenth century which quickly separated seeds from the cotton fibers—the boom in cotton growing across the Deep South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P2'>By 1860, there were approximately 46,200 plantations across the south. More than 20,000 had twenty to thirty slaves. Only about 2,300, or five percent, had one hundred or more slaves. The enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work. The plantations were their home. The same was not always true for the plantation owners. The very large operations frequently had wealthy absentee owners, who resided in cities or other states, leaving plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers. Slave cabins, or slave quarters, were a ubiquitous part of a plantation. They represented the heart of the laborers’ community on the property, but were usually of basic construction and few amenities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P3'>Following the abolition of slavery after the Civil War, many freed people continued to live on plantations. Sharecropping became a popular arrangement between the landowners and the laborers. The property was often divided into plots with tenants assigned to certain sections. The system involved a contract or arrangement which allowed the laborer, or tenant, to keep a portion of the crop they raised. The system was abused, and developed a negative reputation for the level of poverty many sharecroppers (mostly Black, but some white) experienced on plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Representatives of the Freedmen’s Bureau sought to protect Black sharecroppers by regulating contracts during Reconstruction, but the withdrawal of federal officials after 1876 left many African American tenants more subject to unfair sharecropping contracts on the old plantations.

Usually referred to as the Freedmen's Bureau, it was formed during early Reconstruction on March 3, 1865 primarily to assist the transition of over four million enslaved people to freedom across the American South. It operated briefly as a U.S. government agency from 1865 to 1872. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
