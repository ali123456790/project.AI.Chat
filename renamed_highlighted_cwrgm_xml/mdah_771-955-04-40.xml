                    <p xml:id='OTPS97573P0'>Andrew Jackson Gillespie was a state auditor in Mississippi during the nineteenth century. Born on December 10, 1831, in Alabama, Gillespie moved to Mississippi as a young man and found work as a clerk. He developed a good reputation for bookkeeping and became Auditor of Public Accounts in Mississippi. During the Civil War, Gillespie volunteered for Confederate military service. He was commissioned as an officer in the First Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel by the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS97573P1'>After the Civil War, Gillespie declined to resume the office of Auditor of Public Accounts and instead went into commercial business. He partnered with Charles H. Demeritt in a dry goods company, with locations in Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana. He then became active in cotton sales, and was appointed president of the Mobile Cotton Exchange in the 1870s. Gillespie died on September 4, 1878. He was married twice, first to Mary Howard, who passed away in 1864. He then married Ellen Howard. Gillespie had at least six children. He is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P0'>A Unionist was "a member or supporter of the twenty-three Northern states that were not part of the seceding Confederacy during the American Civil War" (Wikipedia). Unionism in the South took on a variety of forms and encompassed many different beliefs. While most northerners sided with the Union, many southerners did as well. Even prior to secession, no solid white South existed, as many white southerners in mountainous and upcountry areas of the South did not own enslaved persons. While some areas like eastern Tennessee and parts of northern Alabama rejected secession outright for the entire war, secession produced renewed patriotism for many non-enslaving whites in the South. That patriotism faltered for many as the awful realities of wartime violence and poverty struck even as early as 1861. Many poor white southerners viewed the Confederacy's conscription, impressment, and taxation policies as elitist, forcing many families to, if not support the Union per se, at least oppose the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P1'>Entire unionist communities developed throughout the war to shield those loyal to the Union or opposed to the Confederacy, as well as deserters from the Confederate Army and, in certain cases, escaped enslaved persons. Southern unionism often led to internal armed conflict between southerners, as bands of guerilla fighters raided Confederate depots and shipping for supplies and even attacked some Confederate units. While unionist strongholds most frequently developed in the mountainous regions of the South and the border states, Unionism spread throughout the entire Confederacy, including one of the most notable in Jones County, Mississippi, where ex-Confederate soldier Newton Knight and roughly 500 others formed the so-called "Free State of Jones" and opposed Confederate forces until the war's end. The presence of Unionism across the South stifled the Confederate war effort in many ways and revealed that tensions of national loyalty, race, class, and gender remained complicated even for southern whites (American Heritage; Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P. Lowry, <hi rend='italic'>The Story the Soldiers Wouldn't Tell</hi>, 104–108)
