                    <p xml:id='OTPS73895P0'>Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard was an educator and university administrator during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P1'>Born on May 5, 1809, in Sheffield, Massachusetts, Barnard studied astronomy at Yale University and graduated there in 1828. He remained in the university system, as a tutor and then instructor, teaching at the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in Connecticut. Barnard and many members of his family suffered from a hereditary form of hearing loss which grew worse through his life. In the late 1830s, he accepted a position at the University of Alabama, teaching a variety of courses, including mathematics, natural philosophy, natural history, and chemistry, until 1854. He then transferred to the University of Mississippi, working initially as a professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, and then accepting a promotion as chancellor in 1856. While a well-respected academic in the south, Barnard held more egalitarian views than his colleagues there. For instance, he drew criticism from southern officials for his acceptance of testimony of a female slave against a white student who reportedly had assaulted her. He also championed equal education opportunities regardless of gender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Barnard resigned from the University of Mississippi due to his Unionist sympathies. He spent the next few years working on various scientific projects before being selected in 1864 to serve as the president of Columbia College (modern-day Columbia University) in New York. He remained in that position until he died in 1889. He expanded the number of departments and improved opportunity for research. During the course of Barnard’s twenty-five year tenure at Columbia, the school’s enrollment grew from 150 to 1,000 students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS73895P3'>Barnard passed away on April 27, 1889, in New York City. He was married to Margaret McMurray. He is buried in Center Cemetery in Sheffield, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027472P0'>Hugh McCulloch was a businessman, banker, and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P1'>Born in Kennebunk, Maine, on December 7, 1808, McCulloch was educated in New England before moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1833 to practice law. Shortly afterwards, in 1835, he began working at the Bank of Indiana, rising from cashier to manager of the Fort Wayne branch, then to president of the overall company. He remained at the bank until 1863, when he was appointed by Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase to be Comptroller of the Currency. McCulloch proved very capable in that role, recommending changes to banking laws and seeing widespread success among banks in the northern states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P2'>In March 1865, President Abraham Lincoln offered McCulloch the position of Secretary of the Treasury. He reluctantly accepted the job, and proved successful at reducing the national debt. He opposed the widespread use of paper currency and labored to reduce paper bills in circulation. The effort was not popular and was eventually halted by Congress. When his term as secretary ended in 1869, McCulloch moved to England and worked as a partner in the banking firm of Jay Cooke, McCulloch &amp; Co. McCulloch was called again to public service in 1884, when President Chester A. Arthur appointed him as Secretary of the Treasury. He served only six months, until March 1885, when Arthur’s presidential term ended.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P3'>McCulloch died on May 24, 1895. He had been married twice, first to Eunice Hardy who died in 1836, only two years after their wedding. He then married Susan Man in 1838 and had at least five children. McCulloch is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

In 1626 it was known as New Amsterdam and was chartered in 1653. It was renamed New York in 1664, and briefly had its name changed to New Orange from July 1673 until November 1674. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. (Wikipedia; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.
