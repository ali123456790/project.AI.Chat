                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005041P0'>Military schools are educational programs that incorporate military studies with traditional academic topics. They often emphasize engineering and technical studies. The school lifestyle and environment typically model the military; students are considered cadets, wear uniforms and conduct formation drills, and follow a military-style chain of command. These schools were largely a nineteenth century development in the United States, following the creation of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, during Thomas Jefferson’s presidential administration. While that academy, and the United States Naval Academy, founded in 1845, were federal institutions, most military schools were private or state-funded programs. Military service was not required for the graduates of state or private military programs, but alumni from such schools often sought commissions in the military. Additionally, during the Civil War, the Union and the Confederate armies relied heavily upon graduates of state and federal military academies to train and lead the large numbers of civilian soldiers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD100571P0'>Founded in 1839 in Lexington, Virginia, the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) was the first state military college in the United States. The school was modeled after the United States Military Academy at West Point and the École Polytechnique school in Paris, France, leading to a more military and engineering program rather than liberal arts. Faculty members tended to be former military officers, including some from Europe. West Point graduate Thomas J. Jackson served as an instructor before becoming a general in the Confederate Army and achieving fame and the nickname “Stonewall” Jackson. Cadets at VMI occasionally participated in active military duties before and during the Civil War, including serving as a military guard during the execution of John Brown following his raid against Harper’s Ferry in 1859. Cadets at VMI also saw combat during the war, being called to action from campus fourteen different times by Confederate authorities.  Dozens of VMI alumni saw service during the Civil War. Fifteen graduates rose to the rank of general within the Confederate Army and one achieve the rank of general in the Union Army. The school remains open today, still serving as a state military college. (Wikipedia)
