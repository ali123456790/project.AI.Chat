                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32025299P0'>George Henry Thomas was a career U.S. Army officer who served as a Union general during the Civil War and commanded various military departments in the south during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P1'>Born on July 31, 1816, at Newsom’s Depot, Virginia, Thomas entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1836 at the age of 20—older than most cadets—leading to his nickname “Old Tom.” He became close friends with his roommate, William Tecumseh Sherman, and graduated in 1840. Thomas was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army and undertook military assignments in Florida during the Seminole Wars, as well as at various forts and posts in Louisiana, Maryland and South Carolina. He then went to Texas at the outbreak of the Mexican-American War in 1846 and served bravely as an artillery officer at Fort Brown, Resaca de La Palma, Monterrey, and Buena Vista. Thomas repeatedly promoted for bravery by the time the war ended in 1848.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P2'>In the early 1850s, Thomas served as a cavalry and artillery instructor at West Point. He then transferred to California as a cavalry officer and spent several years in the western territories, conducting campaigns against Native Americans. In 1860, he was shot in the chest by an arrow during a battle with Comanche warriors at Clear Fork along the Brazos River in Texas. Fortunately for Thomas, due to the angle or velocity of the arrow, he received only a severe flesh wound and the remained in the field after patching the wound.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, many people in the U.S. Army believed Thomas would follow his native state into the Confederacy. Beyond his southern background (and experience in a slave society while growing up in Virginia), Thomas had strong relationships through his military service with men who would be among the Confederacy’s leading figures, such as Braxton Bragg, Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, J.E.B. Stuart, and Fitzhugh Lee. However, Thomas rejected secession and chose to stay loyal to the United States and was quickly promoted to brigadier of volunteers in the Union army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P4'>Many Union officials initially treated Thomas with suspicion due to his southern roots. However, he earned respect from his effective leadership. Initially serving in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, Thomas was sent westward to train and lead Kentucky volunteers for the Union. He scored an important moral victory for the Union in January 1862 at the Battle of Mill Springs in Kentucky, further boosting his reputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P5'>In the spring of 1862, Thomas received a promotion to major general. Over the next several months he commanded Union troops at Corinth, Mississippi, and then during operations in Kentucky and Tennessee. He played a conspicuous part in the Battle of Stones River (or Murfreesboro) in late December 1862 and early January 1863, but has drawn the most praise for his performance at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863. When Confederate forces broke through part of the Union line at that battle, Thomas held a strong defensive position that prevented the entire army from collapsing. He earned the nickname the “Rock of Chickamauga,” and promotion to command of the Army of the Cumberland when his superior, William S. Rosecrans, was relieved after the fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P6'>Thomas continued to score important battlefield victories at Chattanooga, Tennessee, in November 1863 and then in support of William Tecumseh Sherman’s capture of Atlanta, Georgia, in 1864. When Confederate forces under General John Bell Hood moved into Tennessee in the fall of 1864, in an effort to threaten Sherman’s supply line and draw Union forces out of Georgia, Thomas led his Army of the Cumberland against Hood while Sherman conducted his famous “march to the seat” campaign across Georgia to Savannah. Thomas’s army was smaller than Hood’s, but he successfully outmaneuvered the Confederate force to unit with Union reinforcements under Major General John Schofield and defeat Hood at the Battle of Franklin. Thomas then led the crushing defeat of Hood’s army at the Battle of Nashville. Following these victories, Thomas received a promotion to major general in the Regular Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P7'>After the Civil War, Thomas variously commanded military departments in Kentucky and Tennessee, West Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama. He oversaw federal Reconstruction efforts in parts of the former Confederacy and used his military authority to better protect the rights of African Americans. Thomas turned down a promotion to lieutenant general and the possibility of replacing Ulysses S. Grant as general in chief because he wanted to avoid the bitter political battle raging within the higher military and political ranks. Instead, in 1869, he asked to be sent to California to command the Military Division of the Pacific. He died of a stroke at his headquarters on March 28, 1870. Thomas was married to Frances Kellogg. He is buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Troy, New York.

Gen. George H. Thomas and the Army of Tennessee (Confederate) commanded by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. The battle was part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign and resulted in a decisive Union victory. After his defeat at the Second Battle of Franklin in November, Hood moved his army north to threaten the Union at Nashville, arriving on December 2. Ice storms and freezing temperatures prevented both sides from acting for nearly two weeks. Thomas attacked the Confederate positions on December 15, forcing Hood’s army back two miles to the south. On the afternoon of December 16, Thomas pressed the attack inflicting massive losses on Hood’s army and forcing the Confederates to retreat. The total number of forces engaged in the battle was 85,000; 55,000 Union and 30,000 Confederate. Casualties from the battle were estimated at 9,061 with 3,061 Union and 6,000 Confederate. The battle cost Hood 75% of his Army of Tennessee, rendering it ineffective as a fighting force. It also effectively ended the war in Tennessee. (Tennessee Encyclopedia; American Battlefield Trust)

This act excluded high-ranking military leaders and officials, as well as those who committed war crimes. Johnson believed that amnesty was the surest way to rebuild the nation and the General Amnesty Act was one part of his Reconstruction Plan. This act was welcomed by many Northerners who wanted to move on from the Civil War, but was criticized by many radicals who felt the act was too lenient on Confederate actors and wanted those people excluded from society and punished for their actions in the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005041P0'>Military schools are educational programs that incorporate military studies with traditional academic topics. They often emphasize engineering and technical studies. The school lifestyle and environment typically model the military; students are considered cadets, wear uniforms and conduct formation drills, and follow a military-style chain of command. These schools were largely a nineteenth century development in the United States, following the creation of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, during Thomas Jefferson’s presidential administration. While that academy, and the United States Naval Academy, founded in 1845, were federal institutions, most military schools were private or state-funded programs. Military service was not required for the graduates of state or private military programs, but alumni from such schools often sought commissions in the military. Additionally, during the Civil War, the Union and the Confederate armies relied heavily upon graduates of state and federal military academies to train and lead the large numbers of civilian soldiers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63985P0'>Opened in 1802 at West Point, New York, the United States Military Academy is the oldest federal service academy in the United States. Proposed in legislation from Alexander Hamilton, and begun at the direction of President Thomas Jefferson, the academy (often referred to as “West Point”) started with few standards regarding age of cadets or length of study. The War of 1812 prompted revisions within the program and in 1817 the academy’s superintendent Colonel Sylvanus Thayer established a curriculum modeled after the École Polytechnique school in Paris, France, that emphasized technical and engineering instruction. The program was so successful, that it became the model engineering program within the United States during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P1'>By the 1830s, most commissioned officers in the U.S. Army were West Point graduates. However, distrust among many Americans of a strong national government and aristocracy (as well as jealousy among other aspiring military officers), led to some calls for the elimination of the academy. These calls went unheeded, and the strong performance by West Point graduates during the Mexican War in the late 1840s highlighted the value of the academy to the U.S. military.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P2'>The Civil War divided West Point alumni. Some of the most notable academy graduates and staff served the Confederacy, most notably Robert E. Lee. Most of the leading Union generals were also West Point alum, including Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, and George B. McClellan. Over the course of the war, 294 West Point graduates achieved the rank of general in the Union Army and 151 rose to the rank of general in the Confederate Army. The war also cost the lives of 105 West Point graduates, while 151 were wounded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P3'>Due to political tensions within the U.S. from the Civil War, southern applicants were not admitted to West Point until 1868—three years after the end of the war. The first Black cadet, James Webster Smith, was admitted in 1870, however he faced severe discrimination by other cadets and some staff, leading to altercations, a suspension, and eventually dismissal under controversial circumstances. The first African American cadet to graduate West Point was Henry O. Flipper in 1877.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P4'>West Point continues to operate as military service academy training college-aged cadets for the officer corps of the U.S. Army. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P0'>Mississippi historically lagged behind most American states when it came to public education. Although some individuals, including territorial governor W. C. C. Claiborne in 1802, advocated for public education during its earliest territorial days, most officials within Mississippi territory did not endorse a broad system of public schools. The territorial legislature did establish Jefferson College, but made no effort to provide free education to Mississippi children. During the early nineteenth century, most Mississippi children received instruction at home. Some families pooled their resources or were able to direct town funds to pay for local schools, which became the earliest public schools in the state. In 1830, only thirteen percent of Mississippi children attended public schools. Families with more money sent their children to private schools, and the wealthiest often chose to send their children to secondary schools or universities in the north due to the quality of the programs there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P1'>Several small colleges emerged in Mississippi during the nineteenth century, including some women’s colleges. Some of these programs tailored the curriculum to courses seen as appropriate for females in society. This meant heavy emphasis on domestic interests and arts. However, a few of the women’s academies offered a more traditional university course load, including Whitworth College, whose president argued that women were as capable of handling the same intellectual and technical pursuits as men.

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P2'>The Civil War substantially changed public education in Mississippi. The conflict interrupted most Mississippi schools and universities, but federal intervention in Mississippi political and social events after the war led to new emphasis in public schools. Northern Republicans and philanthropic volunteers in Mississippi sought to integrate former slaves into Mississippi society and opened free schools for children, regardless of race. The Mississippi constitution of 1868 directed that the state government provide a public school system funded by taxes for Mississippians between the ages of five and twenty-one. The Reconstruction legislature founded the black land-grant college in the country, Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32081620P3'>The end of Reconstruction led to a downturn in public education across Mississippi. As conservative white southerners regained control of state politics, funding for African American education programs dwindled, and by the 1890s the state formally segregated schools. The Mississippi school system remained segregated well into the twentieth century. Educational support for white children was not a priority for state officials either, and Mississippi did not require school attendance for children until 1918, making it the last state in the United States to enact such law.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63001P0'>St. Thomas’ Hall Military Institute was an Episcopalian boy’s school established in Holly Springs, Mississippi, in 1844 by Reverend Francis L. Hawks. It was one of two military schools for boys in Holly Springs, directly competing against the Chalmers Institute. St. Thomas’ Hall was a well-respected institution for seventeen years, at which point the Civil War broke out. The school shut down as many students and faculty volunteered for the Confederate army. The school buildings served as a hospital for Confederate soldiers until Union troops captured Holly Springs and destroyed most of the campus in 1865. An effort to reopen the school in 1867 failed. An Episcopalian minister tried one more time to open St. Thomas Hall in 1893, purchasing a different building in Holly Springs. That school remained open for approximately five years before a fire burned the main building and forcing the institute to permanently close.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P0'>During the Civil War, Union and Confederate authorities operated prison camps to hold soldiers captured during combat operations between 1861 and 1865. More than 210,000 Union soldiers and more than 460,000 Confederate soldiers became prisoners of war during the conflict. Several prison camps were originally military training camps converted into holding facilities out of necessity. As the war progressed, new camps were constructed specifically to hold prisoners of war. Prison camp conditions deteriorated as large numbers of new detainees arrived, particularly after large battles, stretching existing camps beyond their intended capacities. The most notorious prisons were the Camp Sumter (more popularly known as Andersonville) in Georgia and Camp Douglas in Illinois. More than 30,000 Union prisoners (15%) died in captivity, while almost 26,000 Confederate prisoners (12%) died in Union hands.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P1'>Early in the war, Union and Confederate authorities engaged in a parole system, which typically involved exchanging prisoners. The system occasionally involved instances when direct exchanges were not possible, but officials still released prisoners of war under oath to not take up arms again until the opposing governments had processed a legal exchange at a later date. Parolees guilty of violating the conditions of their release were subject to execution. One notable example of widespread parole was Ulysses S. Grant’s release of thousands of Confederate prisoners captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. This parole system was common in European warfare, but was most often used due to practical limitations of field armies detaining large numbers of prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25018594P2'>The parole system broke down in 1863 when the Confederate government refused to recognize African American Union soldiers as legitimate combatants. Additionally, Union officials recognized that the Confederacy, with its smaller pool of manpower, benefitted more from the parole system than the Union. As a result, the parole system almost entirely ceased in 1864 and the numbers of prisoners of war held in camps in the Union and Confederacy increased significantly. It resumed in early 1865, when the Confederate war effort was collapsing. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
