                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027652P0'>William Yerger served as a justice on Mississippi’s Supreme Court and in the Mississippi legislature during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P1'>Born on November 22, 1816, in Lebanon, Tennessee, Yerger attended the University of Nashville, studied law, and became a practicing attorney at the age of 21. He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1837 and established a successful law practice. He belonged to the Whig Party, an association some in Mississippi later said slowed his ascent within the state’s strong Democratic public and political setting. However, in 1850 he was elected to Mississippi’s High Bench of Errors and Appeals (later called the Supreme Court). He served on the Court for three years, before returning to legal practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P2'>During the Civil War, Yerger served in the Mississippi legislature, and was active in the immediate postwar effort to reconstruct the state government under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient policies for readmission to the Union. He established a very strong reputation as an attorney and jurist in Mississippi, so much so that the state’s Supreme Court adjourned for a day in his honor upon receiving word of his death on June 7, 1872, at the age of 55. Yerger had been married to Malvina Hogan Rucks and had five children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery at Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32028422P0'>Taxation is "the process by which the government of a country obtains money from its people in order to pay for its expenses." (Cambridge Dictionary) During the American Civil War and Reconstruction, the U.S. and Confederate governments expanded their taxation systems to fund their government operations, including military; likewise, states levied their own taxes to fund their respective state governments, including Mississippi. References to Mississippi state taxes and Mississippi residents paying federal taxes are found within this subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32028422P1'>On July 1, 1862, U.S. Congress passed the progressive Internal Revenue Act, and in 1863, the Confederacy likewise authorized a graduated federal income tax that exempted wages up to $1,000, levied a 1% tax on the first $1,500 over the exemption, and 2% on all additional income. Confederate tax systems were even more complicated than the Union's, as states operating under war-time reconstruction governments paid U.S. federal taxes. Income taxes supplemented an already robust tax system that included federal duties, stamp taxes, and fees, among others. Civil War taxes were not immediately repealed at the end of the war but continued until 1872, when President Ulysses Grant's administration sponsored the repeal of most of the "emergency" taxes.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P0'>The tag "Confederate War Dissenters" refers to the white men and women who opposed or challenged the Confederacy internally. The South, even among whites, had never been socially, culturally, or economically homogenous. Indeed, many white southerners lived in rural hill country unsuitable for large-scale agriculture, and many of those white southerners were too impoverished to own enslaved persons. However, they nonetheless joined the Confederacy and went to war to preserve a broader social and economic structure predicated upon slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P1'>As the war drug on into its second and third years, its massive bloodshed and devastating economic impacts exposed the fault lines between socially and economically elite and non-elite in the Confederacy. White men, women, and children living in the Confederacy protested government policies like the Twenty Slave Law that exempted largely-elite enslavers from conscription if they owned twenty or more enslaved persons. Dissent could take many forms—ranging from private correspondence to boycotts, riots, and military rebellion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32086551P2'>One of the largest instances of dissent within the Confederacy came in the Bread Riots of 1863. The Confederacy, notoriously unable to collect taxes, required citizens unable to pay taxes with currency to pay with a "tax-in-kind," or a payment of taxes with its equivalent in goods or livestock. This policy disproportionately affected impoverished women and children barely subsisting and often starving due to the loss of their husbands and fathers off fighting in the war. Women therefore rioted in the Confederate capital at Richmond, as well as in many other cities, in the spring of 1863 to demand bread from the Confederate government. The Bread Riots are only one example of many in which white southerners opposed varied elements of the war effort as it disproportionately subjected them to harm. Crucially, not all dissenters were pro-Union, as many supported the Confederacy's mission but not its policies (American Heritage).
