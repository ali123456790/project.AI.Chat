                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS62962P0'>James Buchanan was president of the United States from 1857 to 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P1'>Born on April 23, 1791, near Cove Gap, Pennsylvania, Buchanan graduated from Dickinson College, Pennsylvania, in 1809. He studied law for three years afterwards and became a practicing attorney in 1812. Buchanan’s legal practice thrived, and he quickly gained wealth, status, and prominence within the Federalist Party. In 1814, he won election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and served one term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P2'>In 1820, Buchanan won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. The political party landscape changed during the 1820s, and he came to support Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. He served as a Democrat in Congress until the early 1830s, and then received an appointment by President Jackson as U.S. ambassador to Russia in 1832. While the position was somewhat prestigious, it had actually been offered to Buchanan as a sort of political exile by Jackson, who did not trust the Pennsylvania congressman.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P3'>After returning from Russia, Buchanan was elected to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate for Pennsylvania. He developed a reputation as a defender of states’ rights, part of the Democratic Party platform, but a position increasingly associated with the southern states’ defense of slavery. He gained prominence in the Senate as the chairman of the powerful Judiciary Committee, and Buchanan’s name frequently came about as a potential candidate for president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P4'>In 1845, President James K. Polk appointed Buchanan to be U.S. Secretary of State. He served in that role during several significant diplomatic events, such as the Mexican-American War (from 1846 to 1848), the Oregon Treaty, and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, all of which significantly expanded the United States’ western territorial holdings.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P5'>Buchanan’s term as secretary of state ended in 1848 with the inauguration of Zachary Taylor as president. He returned to Pennsylvania and for several years focused on private and local matters. He quietly kept in contact with Democratic Party leaders, and maintained his reputation as a defender of states’ rights, and expressed support for the expansion of slavery westward, during the tumultuous political debates over slavery in the early 1850s. Buchanan was considered a serious Democratic candidate for president in 1852, but the nomination went to Franklin Pierce, who won the presidency. Pierce appointed Buchanan U.S. Minister to Great Britain, a position considered somewhat low for his political resume. Nevertheless, Buchanan accepted the assignment and spent nearly three years in Europe. His absence conveniently kept him out of the political debates over the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, a Democratic Party effort that opened all western territories to slavery. The law caused a serious political backlash in the north, hurting the Democrats and giving rise to the Republican Party.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P6'>When Buchanan returned to the U.S., he became the leading Democratic figure for the 1856 presidential election. Supporters championed him as a moderate and compromiser between the strong pro-slavery and anti-slavery sides of the country. Buchanan won the election, with southerner John C. Breckinridge as vice president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P7'>Buchanan’s single term as president saw the country torn by tensions over slavery and economic hardships. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers poured into Kansas to vote (or fight) over the territory’s entrance into the Union as a free or slave state. Buchanan proved sympathetic to the pro-slavery side, despite wide reports of voter fraud and a northern, anti-slavery majority in the territory. The country also underwent a financial panic in 1857 that saw the collapse of 1,400 state banks and 5,000 businesses. Buchanan soon proved overwhelmed by national events, and today he is considered one of the weakest presidents in U.S. history. The success the country saw during his tenure—such as the completion of the transatlantic telegraph line, the admission of three new states, and new diplomatic relations in Asia—were overshadowed by his failure to mediate sectional conflict over slavery and impending civil war. He did not run for reelection in 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P8'>When Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as president in March 1861, Buchanan retired to his home in Pennsylvania. Although historically sympathetic to the south, he denounced the Confederate attack on federal troops at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, in April 1861. Still, he received significant opposition by critics who blamed him for failing to prevent the war, not helped by his argument that anti-slavery northerners were responsible for driving the south to secede.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62962P9'>Buchanan died on June 1, 1868. He was never married. He is buried in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD98881P0'>By the spring of 1862, the difficulty and bloodshed of fighting the Civil War became a reality to many white southerners, and many soldiers' one-year terms of enlistment expired. Voluntary enlistments slowed and rendered the Confederate Army desperate for troops. The Confederate States of America consequently issued the first compulsory call to military service in American history, also called a "draft" or "conscription" with the First Conscription Act of 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD98881P1'>A series of other conscription laws followed throughout the Civil War, each containing measures that sparked tensions between southerners and the Confederate government. The First Conscription Act rendered all men between the ages of 18 and 35 subject to military service, though a later act expanded the age range to 45. Men working in occupations deemed essential to the war effort or to preserving the home front could be exempted from the draft, and, after October 11, 1862, white men owning or overseeing twenty or more enslaved persons could also be exempt. These policies isolated small farmers with little investment in preserving slavery, and many southerners evaded the draft in a variety of ways. However, many others both elite and non-elite viewed the draft as a necessary action, and the Twenty Slave Law a necessary protection from enslaved rebellion. Ultimately, however they felt about it, one estimate holds that Mississippi sent roughly 8,000 draftees to fight for the Confederacy (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

This act excluded high-ranking military leaders and officials, as well as those who committed war crimes. Johnson believed that amnesty was the surest way to rebuild the nation and the General Amnesty Act was one part of his Reconstruction Plan. This act was welcomed by many Northerners who wanted to move on from the Civil War, but was criticized by many radicals who felt the act was too lenient on Confederate actors and wanted those people excluded from society and punished for their actions in the war.

(Wikipedia) Due to calls for reform, the BIA was transferred from the Department of War to the Department of the Interior in 1848. As U.S. policy shifted towards assimilation during the late-nineteenth century, Indian Agents instituted a system of boarding schools, land reform, and other highly coercive methods to assault Native culture and assimilate American Indians into Anglo-American culture while reducing tribal landholdings to 52 million acres by 1934. American Indian parents and tribes resisted these efforts through a variety of methods, including withdrawing their children from schools, challenging state control of their children in U.S. courts, and reinscribing Native culture customs.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P0'>A Unionist was "a member or supporter of the twenty-three Northern states that were not part of the seceding Confederacy during the American Civil War" (Wikipedia). Unionism in the South took on a variety of forms and encompassed many different beliefs. While most northerners sided with the Union, many southerners did as well. Even prior to secession, no solid white South existed, as many white southerners in mountainous and upcountry areas of the South did not own enslaved persons. While some areas like eastern Tennessee and parts of northern Alabama rejected secession outright for the entire war, secession produced renewed patriotism for many non-enslaving whites in the South. That patriotism faltered for many as the awful realities of wartime violence and poverty struck even as early as 1861. Many poor white southerners viewed the Confederacy's conscription, impressment, and taxation policies as elitist, forcing many families to, if not support the Union per se, at least oppose the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P1'>Entire unionist communities developed throughout the war to shield those loyal to the Union or opposed to the Confederacy, as well as deserters from the Confederate Army and, in certain cases, escaped enslaved persons. Southern unionism often led to internal armed conflict between southerners, as bands of guerilla fighters raided Confederate depots and shipping for supplies and even attacked some Confederate units. While unionist strongholds most frequently developed in the mountainous regions of the South and the border states, Unionism spread throughout the entire Confederacy, including one of the most notable in Jones County, Mississippi, where ex-Confederate soldier Newton Knight and roughly 500 others formed the so-called "Free State of Jones" and opposed Confederate forces until the war's end. The presence of Unionism across the South stifled the Confederate war effort in many ways and revealed that tensions of national loyalty, race, class, and gender remained complicated even for southern whites (American Heritage; Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71308P0'><b>Native American History:</b> The Cambridge Dictionary defines a Native American person as "a member of one of the groups of people who were living in North and South America before Europeans arrived." (Cambridge Dictionary) Native Americans have a long and complicated history with the United States. Since the founding of the U.S., Native American tribes, incredibly diverse in language, government, religion, and culture, were barred from U.S. citizenship and treated as independent nations with whom the U.S. was required to act only through mutually agreed upon treaties and diplomatic measures. However, in practice, United States frequently employed deceit and violence to accomplish its aims with Native Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P1'>While Native Americans had lived on North American soil throughout the continent and in every part of what would become the U.S. since long before European settlers arrived, Native American-U.S. relations in the nineteenth century became the story of how the U.S. sought to remove Native Americans from that ancestral land and to colonize it for its own purposes. The largest, though certainly not the only, of these efforts came with the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which in seeking to open the rich soil of southeastern states like Mississippi to enslaved labor required Native Americans living there to relocate to reservations west of the Mississippi River. Indian Removal was a brutal process including extensive forced marches in terrible conditions.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P2'>While Native Americans fought on both sides of the American Civil War, the U.S. Army continued to violently force Native Americans further even from their reservation lands throughout the nineteenth century in a series of conflicts known generally as the "Indian Wars." Despite facing enormous legal, political, and military adversity as well as racism from the American populace, Native Americans often remained both in their original homelands as well as in reservations, working continually to right the historical wrongs committed by the federal government, establishing more equitable relationships to the U.S., and remaining an integral part of American history and life into the twenty-first century. (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P3'><b>Native American Naming Conventions:</b> Native Americans, also referred to as Indigenous people or American Indians, are the original inhabitants of North America. When Columbus sailed from Portugal, he intended to reach the Dutch East Indies, or what is today Singapore. Instead, he landed in the Caribbean and labeled the inhabitants “Los Indios.” (James A. Campbell, “Columbus and <hi rend='italic'>Los Indios</hi> as ‘God’s People’,” <hi rend='italic'>Los Angeles Times</hi>) Thus, the name became anglicized and “Indian” became common usage by Europeans after they arrived in North America. The term “American Indian” is used by the United States Federal Government and by the U.S. Census Bureau. The term Native American and Indigenous are more recent terminology that developed in the latter half of the 20th century, but not all Indigenous people in the U.S. agree to a single unified term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P4'><b>Legal Terminology:</b> Native Americans are incorporated into the U.S. legal system, as they are the only ethnic group explicitly mentioned in the <hi rend='italic'>U.S. Constitution</hi>. The commerce clause restricts individual states from dealing with “Indian Tribes.” (<hi rend='italic'>U.S. Constitution</hi>, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3) Instead, only the federal government can ratify treaties made with American Indians. While treaties are legally binding documents that outline how two governments should honor each other’s promises, they were ratified into law but rarely honored due to corruption or general ill-will. The case <hi rend='italic'>Cherokee v. Georgia</hi> in the 1830s ruled that American Indians are “Domestic Dependent Nations,”  therefore, they have the ability to govern themselves (sovereignty), but with curtailed authority. As a result, Native American sovereignty is frequently determined and redetermined by social events, court decisions, and politicians.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P5'>In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act also known as the Howard-Wheeler Act, giving tribes the ability to adopt constitutions by democratic vote. Some tribes adopted constitutions, while others rejected it. Each tribal community or nation has to be recognized by the U.S. Federal Government to receive services through the Bureau of Indian Affairs or to benefit from certain rights afforded to American Indians.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P6'><b>Native American’s Today:</b> The question of who is considered Native American is a controversial topic, as each tribal community has the sovereignty to determine their own membership. Some use lineal descent, residency, or Blood Quantum—or the calculation of full-blooded “Indian” ancestors in an individual’s lineage to determine a fraction like 1/4)—to determine enrollment in a federally recognized tribe. Today, Native Americans continue to work to achieve and protect sovereignty and the ability to direct their future for their communities. In the 1960s and 1970s, American Indians achieved self-determination—or the ability for tribes to govern themselves with minimal federal oversight—especially regarding treaty rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P7'>CWRGM recognizes the immense diversity of Native American tribes and their unique experiences and therefore uses the "Native Americans" tag to make those experiences more discoverable only in the absence of references to specific tribal names within its documents.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32028180P0'>The Pueblo Indians are "North American Indian peoples known for living in compact permanent settlements known as pueblos. Representative of the Southwest Indian culture area, most live in northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico" (Britannica). Both historic and contemporary Puebloan peoples, like many other native groups, contain a diverse array of ethnic descents and religious, linguistic, cultural, and governmental practices. Prior to European contact, each Puebloan village maintained its own autonomy under the rule of religious leaders and relied on both farming and hunting for provision. Early Pueblo Indians faced some of the earliest contact with Europeans when Spanish colonizers claimed the region for Spain in 1539. However, in 1680, a Pueblo man named Popé led a rebellion against Spanish rule and ousted the Spanish from the region for a decade. After the Spanish reconquest of the region in 1691, many Puebloan tribes adopted the practice of syncretism, or adopting European traditions but infusing them with traditional Puebloan cultural elements to preserve their unique identity, culture, and history. Puebloan peoples and cultures have survived despite both European and American colonization, and one account notes that roughly 75,000 Pueblo-descended people lived in the United States as of the early twenty-first century (Britannica).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69270P0'>Childbirth was one of the most common, yet dangerous, experiences for women during the nineteenth century. Over the course of that century in the United States, on average, women first married at age twenty and gave birth six times during their lives. The act of birth during this period was normally carried out at home, in the presence of female midwives. These midwives were not formally trained physicians (as women were not allowed to formally study medicine in most places), but highly skilled specialists who had gained experience through apprenticeships. Childbirth was seen as a natural process, and many midwives treated births as a sort of ceremony, carrying for the physical, mental, and even spiritual wellbeing of the mother and child with relatively little interference in the actual delivery. Initially, doctors were not summoned unless complications arose and the mother’s life was at risk. Male doctors took a more active role in delivering children by the late nineteenth century, as the medical profession enjoyed rapid gains in scientific knowledge and spreading views of childbirth as a medical procedure. However, childbirth for most women in that era was not a sanitized, carefully monitored procedure in a hospital, but a painful and frightening experience in which her life and that of her baby could be at risk.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P1'>In 1850, more than 20% of children died in infancy. While that number dropped to 12% for white women and 17% for Black women by 1900, most families experienced the death of at least one infant or child during the nineteenth century. Childbirth could also be fatal to the mothers. Women faced potential infections, hemorrhages, eclampsia (a seizure from high blood pressure), and other sudden emergencies during pregnancy and delivery. Even by the end of the century, one in 154 live births resulted in the death of the mother. (This statistic does not include women who died during stillbirth or other pregnancy related complications before delivery.) To put these numbers into a different perspective, with an average of more than five pregnancies per woman, one in thirty mothers would die in childbirth.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P2'>Women faced the risks of pregnancy and childbirth for various reasons. First, other than abstinence, few reliable birth control options existed to average Americans during the nineteenth century. Primitive abortion methods existed, but the practice was restricted and dangerous. Second, an overwhelming majority of Americans lived in rural areas, where children were seen as vital sources of labor. Therefore, farm families had practical interests in reproduction. The cultural emphasis of women as child bearers in nineteenth century America went even further with promotion of “republican motherhood.” This concept championed women as the caretakers of the country’s political future through their work bearing children and raising the next generation of citizens and leaders. These factors combined to make childbirth an expected, and for many a sought after, part of a woman’s life.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P3'>Childbirth rates did decline over the nineteenth century. In 1800, there were approximately 55 births per 1,000 people within the population per year. By 1850, that number had dropped to 43 births per year per 1,000 people, and by 1900 it was down to 30. The Civil War reduced childbirth numbers dramatically, as more than two million men left home to serve in the Confederate and Union armies and more than 600,000 perished between 1861 and 1865. This caused the birth rate to drop in the United States during that period alone by 10%, amounting to roughly 500,000 fewer births.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P4'>The decline in birth rate reflected some social and economic changes, such as an increase in industrialization and declining need for farm labor. Birth rates among white women declined faster than those of African Americans. Many slave owners encouraged their enslaved Black women to reproduce, a practice driven by cold and calculating economic interests. Black women had even fewer birth control options and, even after the end of slavery, most African Americans remained in farming communities with the associated need for family labor. In 1850, there were about 58 births per 1,000 people within the Black population, which dropped only to 44 per 1,000 people in 1900. Despite declining birth rates during the nineteenth century, infant mortality rates and maternal mortality rates also declined, resulting in the American population continuing to grow.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P5'>At the end of the nineteenth century, industrial development and new career opportunities opened opportunities for women outside the home. However, childbirth was still a large part of womanhood in the United States, carrying inherent risks to children and mothers.
