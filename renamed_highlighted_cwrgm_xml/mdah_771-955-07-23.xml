                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71100P0'>Secession is the formal separation from a political group or entity. Secession differs from a revolt in that proponents of secession argue they have the legal right to separate from a government, while a revolt is an illegal, or extra-legal, rejection of government authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P1'>The idea of secession has existed in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution in 1789. During the American Revolution, the thirteen colonies formed the Articles of Confederation, which generally recognized each state as sovereign (supreme in its own authority) except for the powers specifically designated to a central government. Delegated powers included authority to declare war and make peace, international diplomacy, and resolution of disagreements among the states. This arrangement balanced state versus federal power, but also reflected the conflicting ideas of state sovereignty. The Articles described the individual states as sovereign, free, and independent, but also declared the states were required to obey the provisions of the central government and that “the Union shall be perpetual.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P2'>The Articles of Confederation proved too weak to handle many national matters, leading representatives from the states to write a new Constitution in 1787. Opponents of this effort, often referred to as Anti-Federalists, feared strengthening the national government at the expense of state sovereignty. The Constitution did not recognize state sovereignty to the same degree as the Articles of Confederation, demonstrated by terms within the document like “We the people,” which recognized the national government as being of the American people rather than a compact of individual states. Anti-Federalists were unable to prevent ratification of the Constitution, but did prompt the creation of the Bill of Rights—ten amendments that protected specific rights of the people and the states from federal infringement. The Constitution and Bill of Rights remained silent on if or how a state could leave the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P3'>For the first few decades of the Constitutional Union, secession was more of an academic question than a major political issue. The country was growing more divided over the issue of slavery, with white southerners embracing it as a vital part of their economic, social, cultural, and political society, and an increasing number of northerners turning against it. However, politicians in Washington, D.C., had managed to establish a balance between slave and free state interests and representation to maintain a general peace. Then, in the early 1830s, a political crisis emerged over federal protective tariffs. The state of South Carolina objected to the tariffs and declared them null and void within the state boundaries. The incident became known as the Nullification Crisis, and was the first major test of state versus federal authority in the United States. Though the matter directly focused on a state rejecting a national law, a South Carolina convention warned that the state would secede if challenged by the U.S. Congress. Led by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinians argued that the federal government’s authority was limited to those powers specifically listed within the Constitution, leaving all other authority and sovereignty in the hands of the people through their state governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P4'>President Andrew Jackson, a southerner, vehemently denounced South Carolina’s actions, declaring that the Constitutional Union was constructed by the people as a whole, and represents them as such. He argued that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, or ability to act independently from the rest of the country. James Madison, the primary framer of the Constitution, was still alive during the Nullification Crisis and, in a personal letter to Senator Daniel Webster, also denounced secession as contrary to the principles of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P5'>South Carolina found little support from other southern states in its nullification and secession talk in the early 1830s, and eventually backed down, in part due to a compromise tariff. But the crisis had set a prominent seed in the minds of southerners that separation from the United States was a possible option should the central government prove hostile to its interests.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P6'>Over the next two decades talk of secession periodically emerged in political writings and speeches of extremists, in both north and south. While mostly associated to “Fire-Eaters” in the south—who argued that southern slaveholding interests would be better served in an independent south—some extreme abolitionists in the north also talked of secession. These northerners were a distinct minority, and not taken very seriously, but reflected the fact that various special interest groups and political extremists expressed ideas of disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P7'>Secession advocacy hit its zenith during the presidential election of 1860. With the election of Abraham Lincoln, an openly anti-slavery northerner, South Carolina held a convention and passed an ordinance of secession on December 24, 1860, which declared the state to be sovereign and independent and that its union with the other states of the Constitutional Union was "dissolved."  Six other states of the Deep South followed soon after. They quickly united under a new central government, the Confederate States of America. While many people in the north denounced the act (and the population of the upper south was split on the matter of secession), the issue did not spark immediate military action. For several weeks it remained a political matter, with the Lincoln Administration denying the legitimacy of secession and trying to operate as if nothing had changed, and the seceded states trying to create a new government with their own debates over federal versus state authority in the Confederacy. The political tension finally erupted into violence over events in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in April 1861. Confederate forces demanded that federal soldiers evacuate the military fortifications there. Lincoln refused, choosing to maintain his position that secession was illegitimate and that U.S. officials would continue to carry out their duties as usual. In response, Confederate forces attacked and then captured a federal garrison at Fort Sumter, turning the tense political crisis erupted into full blown war. At this point, the question of secession’s legitimacy came down to which side was victorious on the battlefield.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71100P8'>Throughout the war, the Lincoln administration treated Confederate forces as rebellious Americans rather than citizens of a separate country. This view guided Lincoln’s reconstruction ideas, as well. When Confederate forces surrendered and the Confederate government dissolved, the idea of southern secession essentially died. Lincoln’s assassination complicated federal reconstruction efforts, especially with disagreements within the Republican Party of how to treat former Confederates. Congress passed no specific laws about secession as a whole, and the most direct legal assessment of the right of secession in the wake of the Civil War emerged from the Supreme Court in regards to the case <hi rend='italic'>Texas v. White</hi>. While the case involved the sale of U.S. bonds by the former Confederate state legislature, the Supreme Court’s majority decision stated that Texas had never actually seceded from the Union. The majority opinion explained that the United States of America was perpetual and that states could not unilaterally remove themselves from the Union. The Court acknowledged, though, that state independence could result from revolution (the extra-legal rejection of higher authority) or through consent of the other states (secession approved by majority vote among all American states).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32122869P0'>The Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana (also known as the Department of Alabama and East Mississippi) was established in January 1864 when Alabama was incorporated into the former Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. Headquartered at Meridian, Mississippi, it was a geographical command of the Confederate Army that encompassed the entirety of the states of Alabama and Mississippi and the area of Louisiana east of the Mississippi River. On May 8, 1864 its boundaries were redefined to include parts of Tennessee. It was first commanded by Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk (January 28–May 4, 1864) and later by Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Lee (May 4–July 26, 1864). After Lee, command alternated between Maj. Gen. Dabney H. Maury and Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor. Maj. Gen. Dabney H. Maury (July 26–August 15, 1864) Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor (August 15–November 22, 1864), Maj. Gen. Dabney H. Maury (November 22–December 12, 1864), and Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor (December 12, 1864–May 4, 1865). It became defunct when Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor surrendered to Union forces on May 4, 1865.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25005041P0'>Military schools are educational programs that incorporate military studies with traditional academic topics. They often emphasize engineering and technical studies. The school lifestyle and environment typically model the military; students are considered cadets, wear uniforms and conduct formation drills, and follow a military-style chain of command. These schools were largely a nineteenth century development in the United States, following the creation of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, during Thomas Jefferson’s presidential administration. While that academy, and the United States Naval Academy, founded in 1845, were federal institutions, most military schools were private or state-funded programs. Military service was not required for the graduates of state or private military programs, but alumni from such schools often sought commissions in the military. Additionally, during the Civil War, the Union and the Confederate armies relied heavily upon graduates of state and federal military academies to train and lead the large numbers of civilian soldiers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63985P0'>Opened in 1802 at West Point, New York, the United States Military Academy is the oldest federal service academy in the United States. Proposed in legislation from Alexander Hamilton, and begun at the direction of President Thomas Jefferson, the academy (often referred to as “West Point”) started with few standards regarding age of cadets or length of study. The War of 1812 prompted revisions within the program and in 1817 the academy’s superintendent Colonel Sylvanus Thayer established a curriculum modeled after the École Polytechnique school in Paris, France, that emphasized technical and engineering instruction. The program was so successful, that it became the model engineering program within the United States during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P1'>By the 1830s, most commissioned officers in the U.S. Army were West Point graduates. However, distrust among many Americans of a strong national government and aristocracy (as well as jealousy among other aspiring military officers), led to some calls for the elimination of the academy. These calls went unheeded, and the strong performance by West Point graduates during the Mexican War in the late 1840s highlighted the value of the academy to the U.S. military.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P2'>The Civil War divided West Point alumni. Some of the most notable academy graduates and staff served the Confederacy, most notably Robert E. Lee. Most of the leading Union generals were also West Point alum, including Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, and George B. McClellan. Over the course of the war, 294 West Point graduates achieved the rank of general in the Union Army and 151 rose to the rank of general in the Confederate Army. The war also cost the lives of 105 West Point graduates, while 151 were wounded.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63985P3'>Due to political tensions within the U.S. from the Civil War, southern applicants were not admitted to West Point until 1868—three years after the end of the war. The first Black cadet, James Webster Smith, was admitted in 1870, however he faced severe discrimination by other cadets and some staff, leading to altercations, a suspension, and eventually dismissal under controversial circumstances. The first African American cadet to graduate West Point was Henry O. Flipper in 1877.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025540P0'>With roots dating to June 1775 during the American Revolutionary War, the United States Army’s Corps of Engineers was formally established in 1802 at West Point, New York. One of the corps’ first assignment was the management of the United States Military Academy. The school emphasized engineering and technical studies, and the top graduates typically earned Army commissions within the Corps of Engineers. In the 1820s the corps received authority to survey roads and waterways across the United States, and its duties continued to expand to the studying and mapping of lakes in the northwest. In 1838, the War Department created a separate office called the Corps of Topographical Engineers to oversee the design and construction of federal civil works and coastal fortifications. This office was merged with the Corps of Engineers in 1863, during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025540P1'>Many of the top Union and Confederate generals during the Civil War had been part of the Corps of Engineers, including Union generals George McClellan and George Meade, and Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard. During the war, the corps handled many civilian engineering and military construction projects, such as the construction of forts, artillery batteries, railroad bridges, pontoon bridges, and new roads for field armies.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25026109P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines unemployed people as "people who do not have a job that provides money" (Cambridge Dictionary). Due to revolutions in transportation and industrialization in the nineteenth-century U. S., "the number of unemployed men traveling around the country in search of work increased dramatically" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 26). Unemployment took many forms  for diverse reasons. Many who experienced unemployment did so due to nationwide financial depressions or panics, injuries at work, or seasonal layoffs. A large population of unemployed men were migratory workers in the South and West who traveled the country on the nation's emerging railways and performed itinerant labor. Many of these men therefore experienced unemployment temporarily or seasonally. Others experienced long-term unemployment and consequent homelessness, particularly in the nation's rapidly industrializing and crowded cities in the Northeast and Midwest. Men experienced unemployment far more often than women, as many charitable organizations catered exclusively to women, while xenophobia and racism ensured that immigrants and people of color comprised the largest demographic groups to experience unemployment. Aid for the unemployed stemmed almost exclusively from religious or reform-minded charitable organizations, as neither the U. S. government nor many individual states would create a systematic response to unemployment until well into the twentieth century (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 26-7).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
