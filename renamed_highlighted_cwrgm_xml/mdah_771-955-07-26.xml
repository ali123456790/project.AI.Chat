                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32031770P0'>The United States government assumed military control over the former Confederacy and divided states like Mississippi into five military districts in 1867. The states then underwent the process of formally re-entering or regaining full status in the U. S. The first step of that process was the passage and ratification of a new state constitution reflecting the 13th and 14th amendments to the United States Constitution, thereby abolishing slavery and granting African-American men the franchise. Mississippi voters, Black and white, voted by referendum in 1867 to hold a constitutional convention. From January to May 1868, the convention met in Jackson, Mississippi. Composed of African American and white Unionist delegates, the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1868 featured the same high level of tension and acrimonious debate as other Reconstruction-era conventions. The convention prohibited participation by ex-Confederates and consequently excluded many Democrats, who sharply criticized what they dubbed the "Black and tan convention" due to the delegates' race. The convention produced the most progressive constitution in the state's history, abolishing slavery, extending civil rights to all people including African Americans and women, apportioning the number legislative seats based on population, barring ex-Confederates from public office, and establishing free public schools. However, the Constitution of 1868 faced widespread opposition and was voted against by Mississippians in the only popular vote for constitutional ratification in the state's history. At President Ulysses S. Grant's insistence, the Constitution was voted on again later that same year, article-by-article rather than in its entirety. The state passed all but the provision barring ex-Confederates from office, paving the way for Mississippi's re-entry into the Union in 1870 (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD49524P0'>The National Union Party was a political rebranding by many Republicans during the 1864 presidential campaign in response to divisions within overall Republican Party. Some Radical Republicans, upset with President Abraham Lincoln’s moderate approach to war and abolition, broke away to form the Radical Democratic Party to nominate their own candidate for the presidential election. Worried that the fracture would deny Lincoln the political support for reelection, mainline Republicans adopted the name National Union Party and declared its goal to be the unconditional surrender of the Confederacy to attract fiercely anti-secession Democrats opposed to their own party’s lean toward peace with the Confederacy. Additionally, the National Union Party nominated Democrat Andrew Johnson for Lincoln’s vice president. These steps allowed the pro-war Democrats to vote for a political ticket that was not specifically Republican in name or candidates. The National Union Party platform still incorporated some Republican objectives, including support for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery and praise for the use of African American soldiers in the Union army. Lincoln and the National Union Party won the election of 1864, in large part due to Union battlefield victories that boosted confidence in the war effort that summer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD49524P1'>Upon Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865, Andrew Johnson became president. Though nominally the head of the National Union Party, Johnson soon found himself without much organized support. The party had been created to bolster Lincoln’s reelection and the defeat the Confederacy, both of which had been accomplished when Johnson entered the White House. He battled Radical Republicans over Reconstruction policies, which led to his accusations of him being too lenient on the former Confederacy. As Johnson’s reputation soured, many people abandoned the National Union Party. By 1867, the party was a shell of its former self, with many members being southern Unionists like Johnson. When Johnson left the presidency in 1869, with the inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant as a Republican president, the National Union Party officially ended. (Wikipedia)

However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
