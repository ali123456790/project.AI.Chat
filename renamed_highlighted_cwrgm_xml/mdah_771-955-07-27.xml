                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS57093P0'>Oliver Otis Howard was a Union general during the Civil War who led the Freedmen’s Bureau during the Reconstruction era and was a founder of Howard University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P1'>Born on November 8, 1830, in Leeds, Maine, Howard was educated at several schools and academies, including Bowdoin College, before graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1854. He was commissioned a lieutenant and ordnance officer in the U.S. Army, serving at various arsenals in the 1850s. In 1857, Howard participated in the Seminole Wars in Florida. During his service there, he became an evangelical Christian and his religious faith became a defining characteristic for the rest of his life. Although he considered transitioning to a career in the ministry, Howard remained in the army and served as an instructor in mathematics at West Point during the late 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Howard became colonel of the Third Maine Infantry Regiment. During the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, he commanded a brigade of Union soldiers. He performed well enough that the War Department promoted him to brigadier general and continued to command the brigade during the Union’s efforts to capture Richmond during the spring and summer of 1862. Howard played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Fair Oaks on June 1, 1862. During the engagement he sustained two serious wounds to his right arm. Army surgeons amputated the arm and he recovered quickly. More than thirty years later—in 1893—Howard received the Medal of Honor for his actions at Fair Oaks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P3'>By November 1862, Howard was back in the field with a promotion to major general and given command of the XI Corps of the Army of the Potomac. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, his corps was badly beaten by a surprise Confederate flank attack. He faced criticism that he had not properly protected his right flank, and that the collapse of his corps had directly led to the overall Union army’s defeat at the battle.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P4'>Howard faced additional criticism after the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, when his corps was overwhelmed by Confederate troops on the first day of fighting and he then argued with Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, a very popular and successful battlefield commander, over seniority. His corps fought well at Cemetery Hill on the second and third days of the battle, but Howard’s reputation in the Army of the Potomac was strained if not ruined by questionable performances in two major battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P5'>Following Gettysburg, Union officials transferred Howard and his XI Corps to Tennessee, where it joined with Major General Henry Slocum’s XII Corps to form the Army of the Cumberland. He and his corps had greater success in the western theater, taking part in a victorious assault against Confederate troops at Chattanooga and generally performing well as part of William Tecumseh Sherman’s advance on Atlanta, Georgia, in the summer of 1864. In the fall of 1864, Sherman gave Howard command of the Army of the Tennessee, passing over the more senior John A. Logan. Sherman’s decision was reportedly due to the fact that Howard was a West Point graduate, while Logan was not.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P6'>Immediately following the Civil War, Howard was made commissioner of the Army’s Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands—popularly known as the Freedmen’s Bureau—which had martial authority over many aspects of Reconstruction in the former Confederacy. He helped establish schools for freed people, improved medical services to the poor and displaced, and oversaw the distribution of provisions to impoverished areas of the postwar south. Howard and the Freedmen’s Bureau also had authority to redistribute property and prosecute individuals accused of violating Reconstruction policies. Howard ran into opposition from President Andrew Johnson, who was less sympathetic to the plight of African Americans and objected to the bureau’s broad powers. However, Howard was backed by powerful Radical Republicans in Congress through his tenure over the Freedmen’s Bureau.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P7'>In 1866, while commissioner of the bureau, Howard also helped establish a university for African American preachers in Washington, D.C. Originally named the Howard Normal and Theological Institute for the Dducation of Preachers and Teachers, the school was renamed simply Howard University in 1867.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P8'>Howard transferred to the American west in 1872, handling Native American relations for the next several years. He oversaw various military campaigns to relocate Indian tribes, such as the Nez Perce, in the northwest. In 1881, he took a new assignment as superintendent of West Point, but stayed only a year before rotating through a series of departmental commands across the United States. He retired in 1894 as a major general in the Regular U.S. Army. Howard died on October 26, 1909, at the age of 78. He was married to Elizabeth Waite and had at least seven children. He is buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington, Vermont.

The city of Washington became the federal capital on February 27, 1801 and established as Washington, D.C. on February 24, 1801, when the city boundaries were expanded to include the entire Federal District of Columbia. Washington, D.C. has never achieved statehood. (Wikipedia, Britannica)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25008803P0'>During the Civil War, the Confederate government sought ways to finance its military expenditures. Due to strong states’ rights sentiments within the South, the Confederacy’s central government was much weaker than the United States federal government in Washington, D.C. Therefore, Confederate authorities had comparatively less authority and support to levy direct taxes on the civilian population. While direct taxes (such as property taxes and a newly enacted income tax) on northern citizens made up approximately 20% of the U.S. government’s revenue during the Civil War, only around 8% of Confederate revenue throughout the war came from these same sources.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25008803P1'>Confederate authorities sought more options to boost the central government’s coffers and fund the war effort. In August 1861, the Confederate Congress passed the “War Tax,” which taxed Southern citizens for certain luxury items and property valued $500 or greater, including taxes on enslaved people. The funds realized from that tax did not prove sufficient for the expanding costs of war, leading the Confederate government in 1863 to implement a graduated income tax that placed a one percent tax on the first $1,500 earned, and then a two percent tax on additional wages. A more substantial program emerged in April 1863, based on a tithing system of civilians providing ten percent of their agricultural products. Known as the Impressment Act, many of the provisions and supplies gathered from this policy went directly to the Confederate military. These measures led to some fraud and corruption, as well as protest from southern civilians and officials of government overreach, but overall did provide important financial and supply support to the Confederate war effort.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99663P0'>The term "emancipation" describes "the act of freeing a person from another person's control" (Cambridge Dictionary). In the nineteenth-century United States, this term most often referred to an enslaved person's escape from their enslaver's control and legal ownership. Self-emancipation describes "the act of an enslaved person freeing him or herself from the bondage of slavery," by a variety of means legal and extralegal. (American Battlefield Trust)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P1'>Occurring throughout the nineteenth century, self-emancipation under the law took the form of an enslaved person purchasing their own freedom through wages made performing trades outside of their enslaver's property. This process most often occurred in urban areas, particularly those in coastal regions of the U.S., but state legal restrictions made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P2'>The most extreme and least common form of self-emancipation was suicide, which many enslaved people chose rather than remaining in bondage. The most frequent method of self-emancipation, especially during the American Civil War, was to escape from an enslaver's property and flee without their permission. Many notable abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman self-emancipated by running away. Running away signaled how self-emancipation caused legal emancipation for all the enslaved in the United States. During the Civil War, so many enslaved persons self-emancipated and fled to Union lines that the U.S. government had to craft a response. That response manifested first in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later in the 13th Amendment of 1865, which abolished slavery altogether. Self-emancipation became a primary way for enslaved African Americans in the antebellum U.S. to wield agency over their lives, and their efforts eventually succeeded in producing legislative emancipation from the top down.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P0'>When the American Civil War began in the spring of 1861, many northerners and southerners expected the conflict to be short, settled after a rapid military campaign and perhaps one great battle. When those expectations proved incorrect, Union military authorities began conducting broad offensive operations designed to capture key locations within the Confederacy. The first targets held military or political value, such as fortifications, port cities, and capitals. Union armies advancing toward those objectives began capturing pro-secessionist communities. Because federal activities in the South focused on military objectives, Union armies initially had little guidance on how to govern the Confederate areas they occupied. As a result, federal officers relied upon their own interpretation of law and their military authority. Many took a conservative approach, enacting few changes to the local community, while others governed with a heavy hand—either as punishment to secessionists or to enact their favored political policies. One such example included General John C. Frémont’s declaration of martial law and emancipation of slaves in Missouri. The order was quickly overturned by President Abraham Lincoln’s administration, but the incident revealed the varied actions that occurred in pro-secessionist areas occupied by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P1'>As the war progressed, Union armies advanced deeper into the Confederacy. Lincoln began developing plans for reconstruction and reconciliation of Union-controlled areas, but restructuring local governments was only part of the effect occupation had on Southern communities. Federal armies needed supplies. Union officers acquisitioned resources within occupied areas—sometimes with payment, other times by confiscation—to feed and support their military forces. In cases where Union troops could not maintain a permanent presence, they burned or otherwise destroyed Southern crops, buildings, and railroads to deny their use by Confederates.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P2'>Union-occupied areas of the South also saw an influx of northern businessmen anxious to capitalize on Southern resources. Since the Union navy blockaded Confederate ports and prevented exports to Europe, many Southerners had surplus supplies and limited market options. Cotton speculators shadowed Union armies—and in some cases colluded with federal military officials—to negotiate with these desperate Southern planters to send their crop north. This illicit business practice became rampant in occupied areas, prompting the War Department to establish rules for business transactions within Union lines. Illegal trade continued. In December 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant issued General Orders No. 11 in response to continued concerns about market speculation in occupied portions of the Confederacy. The order was highly controversial because it unfairly blamed the Jewish population for the problematic business practices and called for the expulsion of all Jewish citizens from his military department. The Lincoln administration immediately rescinded the order, but Grant lived with the negative effects of his discriminatory proclamation for the rest of his life. The event highlighted the tensions of market speculation and illicit trade in Union occupied areas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P3'>The most significant effect Union occupation had on Southern communities was the disruption of slavery. Enslaved African Americans fled to Union armies to escape bondage. Early in the war, Union commanders had no guiding policy for handling runaway slaves. Some returned them to their owners; others, with abolitionist principles, happily facilitated their escape north or protection behind Union lines. However, in May 1861, Union general Benjamin Butler developed a new legal approach to fugitive slaves when a small number sought refuge within his lines at Union-occupied Fort Monroe, Virginia. He refused to return them to their secessionist owner, declaring them “contraband of war”—property which could be confiscated according to laws of war. News of this policy saw widespread support across the North, as punishment to secessionists but also as a practical way to deny the Confederacy its chief source of labor. The United States Congress soon followed Butler’s actions with legislation authorizing Union armies to confiscate Confederate property and slaves. As the war continued, federal policies against slavery expanded, until Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared all slaves within Confederate areas forever free. Even with Lincoln’s hope for a quick restoration and reconciliation of the Union, occupied areas of the South were forever changed during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025264P4'>At the end of the war, the United States Army occupied the whole South. However, sustained occupation was not possible, especially as the War Department reduced the army by discharging hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers. The army kept troops in the south to enforce federal law—especially to protect African American rights—as former Confederates began to move back into local political offices. However, their role in Southern communities declined until 1877, when southern Democrats and Republican supporters of presidential candidate Rutherford Hayes agreed upon a plan to withdraw the last United States soldiers from the South and end Reconstruction. Federal occupation of the South, which had begun in 1861 in response to secession and the Civil War, was over. (Wikipedia; National Park Service; Army Heritage Center Foundation)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD53477P0'>Refugees is describe as, "A person who leaves [their] home or country to find safety, especially during a war or for political or religious reasons." (Cambridge Dictionary) The American Civil War produced one of the United States' largest refugee crises in history. Scholars have traditionally divided refugees of the Civil War into three groups: African Americans, southern Unionists, and Confederates. One scholar notes that the approach of Union forces sparked the greatest number of refugees from all groups. While southern Unionists and enslaved African Americans fled to Union lines for sanctuary, pro-Confederate white southerners fled away from it for fear of punishment or capture.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD53477P1'>Formerly-enslaved African Americans composed the largest of these groups, as self-emancipated Black men, women, and children fled enslavement and forced the United States to reckon with the fate of enslavement in the nation's war aims. The Union Army established camps, known as "contraband camps" because of the Union stance that enslaved persons were technically contrabands of war, where African-American refugees lived and labored for the Union Army, albeit in often unsanitary, unsafe, and inadequate living conditions. Pro-Confederate, southern, white refugees were much smaller in number and largely represented the wealthier classes who could afford the costs of travel and relocation. These refugees most often gravitated toward cities and near railroad lines where they could return home if possible. Unionist refugees often fled their southern homes due to hostility from their pro-Confederate neighbors, late-war economic hardships, and fear of being drafted into the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD53477P2'>All three groups shared the enormous dangers of traveling on poorly constructed means of transportation in the South, vulnerability of women and children traveling outside of their local communities often for the first time, and the general lawlessness prevailing in war-wracked and desperate areas. The American Civil War therefore dislocated thousands of people of all backgrounds, and while many would go back to their former homes after the war, others would never return (Encyclopedia Virginia; David Silkenat, "Refugees and Movement in the Civil War," <hi rend='italic'>The Cambridge History of the American Civil War</hi>).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

At the end of said term, or at any time during said term, the occupants of any parcels so assigned may purchase the land, and receive such title thereto as the United States can convey, upon paying therefor the value of the land as ascertained and fixed, for the purpose of determining the annual rent aforesaid."

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210578P6' xml:id='OTP32210578P6'>III. Whenever any abandoned lands or other abandoned propety that shall have come into the possesion of the Bureau, does not fall under the definition of "abandoned," as set forth in Sec. 2, of the Act approved July 2, 1864, it will be formally surrendered by the Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau, upon clear proof that the claimant did not abandon the property in the sense defined in said section and act.

They will, with as little delay as possible, select and set apart such confiscated and abandoned lands and property as may be deemed necessary for the immediate use of Refugees and Freedmen, the specific division of which into lots and the  rental or sale thereof, according to the law establishing the Bureau, will be completed as soon as practicable and reported to the Commissioner. In the selection and setting apart of such lands and property, care will be used to take that about which there is the least doubt as to the proper custody and control of this Bureau.
