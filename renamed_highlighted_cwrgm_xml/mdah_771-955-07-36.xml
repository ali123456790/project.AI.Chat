                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63185P0'>"Jefferson Davis was a politician and military officer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives, in the U.S. Senate, as U.S. Secretary of War, and finally as president of the Confederate States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P1'>Born on June 3, 1808, in Fairview Kentucky, Davis moved to Louisiana and then Mississippi as a child with his family. He attended various schools in Mississippi and Kentucky before attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He transferred to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1826. He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25011848P0'>William Tecumseh Sherman was a Union general most famous for capturing Atlanta, Georgia, and conducting a military campaign across Georgia, helping bringing an end to the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P1'>Born on February 8, 1820, in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman was the son of a large and prestigious family. However, his father died suddenly in 1829, leading to Sherman and his siblings being sent to live with friends and family. Sherman moved in with Thomas Ewing, who later became a United States senator. Ewing helped Sherman receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1840 and saw service in Florida during the Seminole Wars.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P2'>Sherman was sent to California during the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s and missed the field experience and promotions many of his military colleagues enjoyed during campaigns in Mexico. He married Ellen Boyle Ewing, one Ewing’s daughters, in 1850. The couple had eight children over the course of their marriage. He remained in military service in California until 1853, when he resigned and went into banking. He proved moderately successful, but left California in the late 1850s and moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, to work as an office manager in a law firm operated by two of his wife’s brothers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P3'>In 1859, Sherman received an offer to be superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning &amp; Military Academy in Pineville, Louisiana. (The school would later become Louisiana State University.) He proved to be an effective teacher and school administrator, and was popular among students and faculty. However, when the Civil War broke out in 1861, Sherman resigned from the position and traveled north to volunteer for Union military service. He was commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S. Infantry Regiment, and then placed in command of a brigade of volunteers in Virginia. He led the brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The battle was an embarrassing defeat for the Union Army, but Sherman performed well and was promoted to brigadier general. He was sent to Kentucky to assist federal military operations in the west.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P4'>While in Kentucky, Sherman expressed his belief that the conflict would be long and bloody. He received criticism for this unpopular opinion, although he was later proven entirely correct. In late 1861, Sherman began to suffer from depression, contemplating suicide, and resigned from his position in Kentucky. After recuperating for several weeks, he returned to service in December 1861 and was placed in charge of logistical operations in the Department of the Mississippi. In that role he supported Ulysses S. Grant’s successful capture of Fort Donelson, and was so impressed by the victory that he requested to serve under Grant, despite technically having higher seniority in rank. In March 1862, the War Department granted Sherman’s wish and was given command of a division within Grant’s Army of West Tennessee, helping establish one of the most effective partnerships in U.S. military history.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P5'>Only a month later, in April 1862, Sherman’s division was overrun by Confederate troops under Albert Sidney Johnston during the first day of the Battle of Shiloh. Sherman rallied many of his soldiers and, alongside Grant, the next day counterattacked and pushed the southern troops back to win the battle. Sherman was wounded twice at Shiloh, and had three horses shot from under him. Grant was impressed with Sherman’s performance, and the War Department promoted him to major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P6'>Over the next two years, Sherman became one of Grant’s most trusted subordinates, leading part of Grant’s army during the Vicksburg campaign and during engagements around Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1863. In the spring of 1864, when Grant received promotion as overall commander of Union armies, Sherman was placed in command of federal troops in the western theater. Grant relocated to Virginia to lead Union forces against Robert E. Lee’s famed Army of Northern Virginia while Sherman crafted a plan to drive an army into the heart of the Confederacy. In early 1864, he launched a campaign from Chattanooga to capture the major industrial city of Atlanta. Over the course of several weeks, he commanded three Union armies in a coordinated advance against Confederate forces under Joseph E. Johnston. Sherman captured Atlanta in September 1864, strongly boosting northern morale and aiding to Abraham Lincoln’s reelection in 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P7'>Following his capture of Atlanta, Sherman embarked on an even bolder campaign. Leaving two of his three armies to watch a Confederate army under John Bell Hood in Tennessee, Sherman personally took command of his third army and ordered it to march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah. The effort involved a great deal of risk, as it saw Sherman’s army cut off from other Union forces, with no base of supply or reinforcements. With 60,000 soldiers, Sherman advanced across Georgia, destroying buildings, burning crops, and generally bringing destruction to southern communities not yet exposed to the realities of war. His army killed relatively few people compared to that seen in other Civil War campaigns, as southern commanders could not field a sufficient force in Georgia to attack the federals in force. However, the psychological effect was monumental, and his capture of Savannah on December 21, 1864, electrified the north and convinced many southerners that the Confederacy was doomed.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P8'>After reaching Savannah, Sherman turned his army northward and marched through South Carolina, the first state to secede. His troops again burned buildings and crops on his way to Columbia. They captured the city on February 17, 1865, and the city burned that night and the next day. While many blamed Sherman’s Union soldiers for destroying South Carolina’s capital out of vengeance, some of the fires may have been caused by Confederate soldiers trying to destroy large stores of cotton before abandoning the city. Sherman then continued northward into North Carolina and defeated Joseph E. Johnston’s army shortly after Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P9'>Despite his reputation for destruction during the war, Sherman held no animosity toward former Confederates. In fact, his initial terms of surrender to Confederate forces in North Carolina were considered too lenient and were overruled by federal officials, who were especially enraged by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln only days earlier.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P10'>After the war, Sherman remained in the army and was promoted to lieutenant general. During the late 1860s, he oversaw U.S. military operations in the west against Native Americans. In 1869, after Grant won election as president of the United States, Sherman was promoted to full general and made Commanding General of the United States Army. He remained in that position until 1883. Three years before he retired, during a speech to a large crowd in Columbus, Ohio, Sherman stated, “There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.” Within months, the line had become immortalized as “War is hell.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P11'>Sherman spent his last years in New York City, attending social events and entertaining guests and notable public figures. Among the people he routinely conversed with was his former enemy, Joseph E. Johnston. The two ex-generals highly respected each other. Sherman was briefly considered as a candidate for president in 1884, but stated that he would refuse to serve in that office even if elected.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25011848P12'>Sherman died on February 14, 1891, at the age of 71. Joseph E. Johnston attended a large funeral for Sherman in New York as an honorary pallbearer, and stood in the cold rain without a hat out of respect. When cautioned that he should cover up to prevent getting sick, Johnston reportedly said, “If I were in [Sherman’s] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat.” Johnston in fact did become sick shortly after Sherman’s funeral and passed away from pneumonia a few weeks later. Sherman's remains were transported to Missouri for final interment. Today he is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32028422P0'>Taxation is "the process by which the government of a country obtains money from its people in order to pay for its expenses." (Cambridge Dictionary) During the American Civil War and Reconstruction, the U.S. and Confederate governments expanded their taxation systems to fund their government operations, including military; likewise, states levied their own taxes to fund their respective state governments, including Mississippi. References to Mississippi state taxes and Mississippi residents paying federal taxes are found within this subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32028422P1'>On July 1, 1862, U.S. Congress passed the progressive Internal Revenue Act, and in 1863, the Confederacy likewise authorized a graduated federal income tax that exempted wages up to $1,000, levied a 1% tax on the first $1,500 over the exemption, and 2% on all additional income. Confederate tax systems were even more complicated than the Union's, as states operating under war-time reconstruction governments paid U.S. federal taxes. Income taxes supplemented an already robust tax system that included federal duties, stamp taxes, and fees, among others. Civil War taxes were not immediately repealed at the end of the war but continued until 1872, when President Ulysses Grant's administration sponsored the repeal of most of the "emergency" taxes.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99663P0'>The term "emancipation" describes "the act of freeing a person from another person's control" (Cambridge Dictionary). In the nineteenth-century United States, this term most often referred to an enslaved person's escape from their enslaver's control and legal ownership. Self-emancipation describes "the act of an enslaved person freeing him or herself from the bondage of slavery," by a variety of means legal and extralegal. (American Battlefield Trust)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P1'>Occurring throughout the nineteenth century, self-emancipation under the law took the form of an enslaved person purchasing their own freedom through wages made performing trades outside of their enslaver's property. This process most often occurred in urban areas, particularly those in coastal regions of the U.S., but state legal restrictions made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P2'>The most extreme and least common form of self-emancipation was suicide, which many enslaved people chose rather than remaining in bondage. The most frequent method of self-emancipation, especially during the American Civil War, was to escape from an enslaver's property and flee without their permission. Many notable abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman self-emancipated by running away. Running away signaled how self-emancipation caused legal emancipation for all the enslaved in the United States. During the Civil War, so many enslaved persons self-emancipated and fled to Union lines that the U.S. government had to craft a response. That response manifested first in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later in the 13th Amendment of 1865, which abolished slavery altogether. Self-emancipation became a primary way for enslaved African Americans in the antebellum U.S. to wield agency over their lives, and their efforts eventually succeeded in producing legislative emancipation from the top down.

This act excluded high-ranking military leaders and officials, as well as those who committed war crimes. Johnson believed that amnesty was the surest way to rebuild the nation and the General Amnesty Act was one part of his Reconstruction Plan. This act was welcomed by many Northerners who wanted to move on from the Civil War, but was criticized by many radicals who felt the act was too lenient on Confederate actors and wanted those people excluded from society and punished for their actions in the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P0'>A Unionist was "a member or supporter of the twenty-three Northern states that were not part of the seceding Confederacy during the American Civil War" (Wikipedia). Unionism in the South took on a variety of forms and encompassed many different beliefs. While most northerners sided with the Union, many southerners did as well. Even prior to secession, no solid white South existed, as many white southerners in mountainous and upcountry areas of the South did not own enslaved persons. While some areas like eastern Tennessee and parts of northern Alabama rejected secession outright for the entire war, secession produced renewed patriotism for many non-enslaving whites in the South. That patriotism faltered for many as the awful realities of wartime violence and poverty struck even as early as 1861. Many poor white southerners viewed the Confederacy's conscription, impressment, and taxation policies as elitist, forcing many families to, if not support the Union per se, at least oppose the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P1'>Entire unionist communities developed throughout the war to shield those loyal to the Union or opposed to the Confederacy, as well as deserters from the Confederate Army and, in certain cases, escaped enslaved persons. Southern unionism often led to internal armed conflict between southerners, as bands of guerilla fighters raided Confederate depots and shipping for supplies and even attacked some Confederate units. While unionist strongholds most frequently developed in the mountainous regions of the South and the border states, Unionism spread throughout the entire Confederacy, including one of the most notable in Jones County, Mississippi, where ex-Confederate soldier Newton Knight and roughly 500 others formed the so-called "Free State of Jones" and opposed Confederate forces until the war's end. The presence of Unionism across the South stifled the Confederate war effort in many ways and revealed that tensions of national loyalty, race, class, and gender remained complicated even for southern whites (American Heritage; Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69270P0'>Childbirth was one of the most common, yet dangerous, experiences for women during the nineteenth century. Over the course of that century in the United States, on average, women first married at age twenty and gave birth six times during their lives. The act of birth during this period was normally carried out at home, in the presence of female midwives. These midwives were not formally trained physicians (as women were not allowed to formally study medicine in most places), but highly skilled specialists who had gained experience through apprenticeships. Childbirth was seen as a natural process, and many midwives treated births as a sort of ceremony, carrying for the physical, mental, and even spiritual wellbeing of the mother and child with relatively little interference in the actual delivery. Initially, doctors were not summoned unless complications arose and the mother’s life was at risk. Male doctors took a more active role in delivering children by the late nineteenth century, as the medical profession enjoyed rapid gains in scientific knowledge and spreading views of childbirth as a medical procedure. However, childbirth for most women in that era was not a sanitized, carefully monitored procedure in a hospital, but a painful and frightening experience in which her life and that of her baby could be at risk.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P1'>In 1850, more than 20% of children died in infancy. While that number dropped to 12% for white women and 17% for Black women by 1900, most families experienced the death of at least one infant or child during the nineteenth century. Childbirth could also be fatal to the mothers. Women faced potential infections, hemorrhages, eclampsia (a seizure from high blood pressure), and other sudden emergencies during pregnancy and delivery. Even by the end of the century, one in 154 live births resulted in the death of the mother. (This statistic does not include women who died during stillbirth or other pregnancy related complications before delivery.) To put these numbers into a different perspective, with an average of more than five pregnancies per woman, one in thirty mothers would die in childbirth.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P2'>Women faced the risks of pregnancy and childbirth for various reasons. First, other than abstinence, few reliable birth control options existed to average Americans during the nineteenth century. Primitive abortion methods existed, but the practice was restricted and dangerous. Second, an overwhelming majority of Americans lived in rural areas, where children were seen as vital sources of labor. Therefore, farm families had practical interests in reproduction. The cultural emphasis of women as child bearers in nineteenth century America went even further with promotion of “republican motherhood.” This concept championed women as the caretakers of the country’s political future through their work bearing children and raising the next generation of citizens and leaders. These factors combined to make childbirth an expected, and for many a sought after, part of a woman’s life.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P3'>Childbirth rates did decline over the nineteenth century. In 1800, there were approximately 55 births per 1,000 people within the population per year. By 1850, that number had dropped to 43 births per year per 1,000 people, and by 1900 it was down to 30. The Civil War reduced childbirth numbers dramatically, as more than two million men left home to serve in the Confederate and Union armies and more than 600,000 perished between 1861 and 1865. This caused the birth rate to drop in the United States during that period alone by 10%, amounting to roughly 500,000 fewer births.

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P4'>The decline in birth rate reflected some social and economic changes, such as an increase in industrialization and declining need for farm labor. Birth rates among white women declined faster than those of African Americans. Many slave owners encouraged their enslaved Black women to reproduce, a practice driven by cold and calculating economic interests. Black women had even fewer birth control options and, even after the end of slavery, most African Americans remained in farming communities with the associated need for family labor. In 1850, there were about 58 births per 1,000 people within the Black population, which dropped only to 44 per 1,000 people in 1900. Despite declining birth rates during the nineteenth century, infant mortality rates and maternal mortality rates also declined, resulting in the American population continuing to grow.

<p xml:id='OTPSD69270P5'>At the end of the nineteenth century, industrial development and new career opportunities opened opportunities for women outside the home. However, childbirth was still a large part of womanhood in the United States, carrying inherent risks to children and mothers.

              <label>Description</label>
              <value>From the Mississippi Department of Archives and History Governor Sharkey Collection. Letter from B. F. Moore Jr., a former slaveholder, at Meridian, Mississippi, to Mississippi Governor William L. Sharkey at Jackson, Mississippi, refusing to take the amnesty oath. Moore states that he has always been a loyal Unionist who never willingly aided the Confederacy. He complains about the emancipation of enslaved persons, claiming that said persons are his &quot;property&quot; and that the government cannot take them from a loyal citizen without financial compensation. Moore believes that taking the amnesty oath would amount to admitting to treason and thus to waiving his claims for financial compensation.</value>

It cant be taken away unless I am a traitor, and my property confiscated. I have read your circular, and admit that slavery is dead, dead, dead, but that is not the question, the question is. this, can the Ustates take away a loyal citizens property without compensation, as the Constitution<del rend='overstrike'>al</del> provides "that no man shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. The Ustates govmnt is too poor now I admit to pay for the negroes of the loyal men of the south, but it can pay after 20 years have passed. I suppose that you have been loyal to the Ustates Govment, and do you not expect the Ustates Govmnt to pay you for your lost slaves, if they do not they are not just, nor wise. If the Govmt is too poor to pay for this species of property let them not take it away by force, but ask the loyal <rs ref='#S63012'>planters</rs> to give them to them and they will do so willingly. It is a poor Govmnt who takes away a loyal man's property in the south, and does not touch a disloyal ones in the north, because of the accident of <rs ref='#S69270'>birth</rs>, or because he owns a peculiar species of property; these are my views and
