                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52243P0'>Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth president of the United States, whose election to the White House as an anti-slavery Republican in 1860 led several southern states to declare themselves separate from the Union and create the Confederate States of America. Lincoln was commander-in-chief of Union forces during the Civil War. Over the course of four years, Lincoln oversaw the Union war effort and took steps to end the institution of slavery to aid the federal military effort and destroy the root cause of the north versus south sectional conflict.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P1'>Born on February 12, 1809, near Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln moved with is family to Indiana as a child and grew up in a poor, frontier society. Although he received minimal formal education, Lincoln proved to be highly intelligent and a voracious reader. He held various jobs as a young man, including working on a flatboat down the Mississippi River, splitting rails and logs, and as a store keeper. He moved to Illinois in 1830 and in 1832, he volunteered for military service during the Black Hawk War in Illinois. Elected captain of a militia company, Lincoln saw no combat, but credited his time leading men in the military as one of the most proud and instructional periods of his life.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P2'>After the Black Hawk War, Lincoln operated a general store in New Salem, Illinois. When the business began to lose money, he decided to study law and become an attorney. Unlike most other lawyers, who attended a law school or studied under established attorneys, Lincoln’s education was self-guided through legal texts and books he borrowed or purchased. Meanwhile, he developed an interest in politics. After an unsuccessful run for the Illinois legislature in 1833, he ran again in 1834 and won a seat in the state’s House of Representatives. He served one term and became known for his support of internal improvements and his Free Soil position on slavery, which opposed slavery in the new territories and criticized abolition (the immediate, forced end of slavery).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P3'>After leaving the Illinois legislature in 1836, Lincoln became a successful attorney in Springfield. He handled many different types of cases, and over the course of his legal career, representing poor individuals in criminal cases as well as large businesses, such as the Illinois Central Railroad. Lincoln argued 175 cases before the Illinois Supreme Court, serving as the single attorney in 51 of those cases (31 of which he won). As an attorney, he developed a reputation for integrity and earned the nickname “Honest Abe.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P4'>In 1846, Lincoln won an election as a member of the Whig Party to the U.S. House of Representatives for Illinois. As a freshman congressman, he helped author legislation to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but the bill died due to insufficient support. More notably, Lincoln opposed the Mexican-American War which erupted in 1846 due to a border dispute between the United States and Mexico. He criticized Democratic president James K. Polk, but this proved unpopular in his home state. He had promised to only serve one term in Congress and declined to run for reelection. He returned to Springfield after the expiration of his term in 1849 and resumed his law practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P5'>Lincoln’s political ambitions continued to grow in the 1850s. The volatile debate over the future of slavery in the territories, especially following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854—which overturned slavery restrictions established by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and opened all western territories to slavery through popular sovereignty (vote of the residents)—inspired Lincoln to speak publicly about his opposition to slavery. His chief rival became Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas, a powerful voice in the national Democratic Party, and the author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Lincoln gave numerous speeches denouncing slavery as a moral wrong and opposing its extension into the territories. However, like most northerners, he was not an abolitionist and did not advocate for the immediate end of slavery across the United States. Most white Americans during the 1850s embraced white supremacy, and many northerners did not want African Americans—as slaves or as free people—in their communities. Lincoln believed that southern states had the legal right to maintain the institution of slavery within their own borders, and he fended off accusations that he was for African American equality. For years he gave tacit support to a plan promoted among moderate politicians to send freed slaves to Africa.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P6'>The issue of slavery in the territories effectively broke apart the Whig Party and gave rise to the new Republican Party. Lincoln joined this new anti-slavery party and by 1858 received the party’s nomination in Illinois to challenge Douglas’s reelection to the U.S. Senate. Upon receiving the nomination, Lincoln gave one of his most famous speeches, declaring in part that “a house divided against itself cannot stand”—a reference to the United States being half slaveholding and half free—and predicting that the fight over slavery would either make the country give in to slaveholding interests or end the institution. During the 1858 Illinois campaign, Lincoln and Douglas engaged in eight public debates which have become the most famous political debates in United States history. Douglas championed his principle of “popular sovereignty,” allowing white residents of the territories to make their new states free or slaveholding, while Lincoln advanced a moral opposition to slavery in the territories as contrary to the principles of American freedom. Douglas ultimately won the Senate election, but the debates catapulted Lincoln to national fame and the leading voice for the growing anti-slavery movement in the north
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P7'>Only two years later, in 1860, the Republican Party nominated Lincoln for U.S. president. His chief rival was, again, Stephen Douglas. The election was the most contested and significant in American history. The Democratic Party split during its convention over the defense of slavery. Douglas and his outwardly neutral platform on slavery received the party’s formal nomination, but many southern delegates walked out to hold their convention, nominating John C. Breckenridge as the champion of pro-slavery interests. Talk of secession, which had circulated in years past, increased as southern politicians warned that election of Lincoln would be a direct assault upon their slaveholding interests and justify disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P8'>Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election without any southern support, not only placing the first truly anti-slavery president in the White House but proving that northern voters could elect a candidate against southern interests. Within weeks, states in the lower south began holding secession conventions to declare their separation from the Union. South Carolina led the way with its ordnance of secession passing on December 20, 1860. Mississippi was second, on January 9, 1861. In total, seven southern states declared secession even before Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P9'>Lincoln entered the presidency in the midst of this secession crisis. He rejected the legitimacy of the lower south’s separation from the Union. The matter erupted into open hostilities in April 1861, when Confederate forces attacked and overwhelmed federal troops at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. In response, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion, as he called it. Northern states responded enthusiastically, while several states in the upper south—including Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee—chose to join the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P10'>Lincoln’s objective at the start of the Civil War was restoration of the Union as it was. He resisted efforts by more radical anti-slavery northerners to attack slavery itself, and overruled Union general John C. Frémont’s effort to liberate slaves in Missouri in 1861. His actions were guided by concerns regarding his legal authority to challenge slavery where it already existed, and from fears that such steps would drive moderate Unionists in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland into the Confederacy. (Lincoln still personally opposed slavery and in 1862 signed an emancipation act liberating enslaved people in Washington, D.C., fulfilling a goal he had first undertaken as a congressman in the 1840s.)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P11'>However, as Confederate military forces won multiple battlefield victories in 1861 and 1862, prolonging the conflict, Lincoln sought more desperate measures. For one, thousands of enslaved people had fled to Union lines, and more arriving daily. Secondly, the institution was the Confederacy’s greatest economic and labor interest. Millions of enslaved people grew crops that fed and funded the Confederate war effort, and southern officials used slave labor to construct forts and trenches that held back the Union armies. Recognizing that the Union could not defeat the Confederacy while protecting or leaving the institution of slavery untouched, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in secessionist areas permanently free. Although the proclamation was limited in scope (as it was a military measure that did not, nor could not, liberate enslaved people in areas not in rebellion against federal authority), it was a revolutionary act in American history. It formally changed the Union objective of the war, from preserving it as it was to “a new birth of freedom,” as Lincoln famously said in a speech in November 1863 at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Additionally, the proclamation authorized federal officers to protect the freedom of all enslaved people who fled to Union armies in Confederate territories and to liberate those they encountered during their campaigns in the south. Finally, the Emancipation Proclamation formally authorized the United States military to enlist African American soldiers. As a result around 180,000 black soldiers fought for the Union during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P12'>Throughout the Civil War, Lincoln struggled to lead the Union war effort in a challenging political and military environment. Democrats in the north vehemently opposed his administration and Republican Party policies, particularly those against slavery. Union generals in Virginia failed to defeat the Confederate army, lowering morale in the north and boosting prospects of southern success. Lincoln managed to handle these various challenges well, often accepting public criticism from generals and relieving them of command only when they failed to deliver military victories. He also stretched the authority of the presidency, authorizing the imprisonment of critics he believed directly harmed the war effort. While his administration was accused of violating the civil rights of some Americans, the Republican-led Congress frequently backed Lincoln and expanding his power.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P13'>In 1864, Lincoln feared he would lose reelection as the Civil War continued to drag on, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and millions of dollars. However, through battlefield successes by Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan in Virginia and Georgia, Lincoln won the election and support to continue the war until Confederate defeat. He also worked behind the scenes with Congress and various state leaders to legally end slavery through a constitutional amendment. While he voiced some support for the old plan of relocating freed slaves to Africa, by the end of the war Lincoln knew such plan was impractical and he supported protecting basic civil rights of African Americans within the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P14'>In the spring of 1865, the Confederate war effort began to collapse. Much of Lincoln’s attention was turned to reconstructing the former Confederate areas, some of which were already under federal control. He advocated for a speedy reunification, without malice or vengeance, and one in which former secessionists were welcomed back to the Union without slavery and with some recognitions of black civil rights. In April 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to General Grant in Virginia and Union forces chased down the last southern troops across the lower south. On April 14, as the Civil War was ending, Lincoln was shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. The mortally wounded president was carried to a boarding house across the street where he passed away the following morning. Lincoln’s murder ended most hopes for a peaceful reconstruction, as it inflamed tensions in the north and energized Radical Republicans who Lincoln had largely held in check.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52243P15'>Lincoln was married to Mary Todd, who was from a wealthy family in Kentucky. He had four sons, only one of whom (Robert) survived into adulthood. Lincoln is buried in a large tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73473P0'>Clubs and secret societies have been common throughout American history. Clubs are often small, localized groups formed openly by people who wish to enjoy or promote a common interest or cause, such as sports, hobbies, or politics. However, clubs are often associated with recreational interests. Secret societies, on the other hand, are organizations that keep their purpose, members, and activities concealed from outsiders. Some hide their very existence from the public, while others keep only their inner workings masked to retain a feeling of exclusivity or mystery for their members. Truly secret societies often exist for political reasons, where members wish to advocate or influence events covertly. Such organizations are often viewed with suspicion, and many conspiracy theories involve accusations of secret societies manipulating events for a sinister agenda.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73473P1'>Clubs and secretive organizations were very popular during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Fraternal groups, such as the Freemasons and Odd Fellows, which were well-known but had secret rituals and exclusive membership, thrived. Many such groups professed dedication to morality and ethical living, or supported charitable cause. However, members were often drawn to those organizations for the social bonds and camaraderie. The popularity of these organizations frequently led to their expansion to other cities, states, or even countries. Due to limited methods of communication before the twentieth century, local chapters or lodges often remained fairly independent from each other. Additionally, regional interests or differences occasionally caused divisions within national or international clubs and societies. For instance, disputes about slavery in the nineteenth century caused a rift between British and American members of the Independent Order of Good Templars.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P0'>An immigrant is "a person who has come to a different country in order to live there permanently" (Cambridge Dictionary). Immigrants from other nations have always comprised a significant portion of the U.S. population, yet the number was relatively small until the middle decades of the nineteenth century, when political and economic turmoil in Europe forced many people to flee. Immigrants came from all over the world, though the vast majority (90.4 percent by one estimation) came from Europe (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 54). In the West, and particularly in California, the United States also saw a large increase in Chinese and Japanese-born immigrants.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P1'>Immigrants came to the United States for varied reasons. Many Eastern and Western Europeans immigrated to flee religious or political persecution, while immigrants from around the world sought to improve their economic circumstances in the U. S. Immigrants to the U. S. settled overwhelmingly in urban centers, though some few also settled in rural areas of the South and Midwest.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P2'>Immigration often led to racial, ethnic, and class conflicts. Many native-born, white, Protestant Americans feared the ethnic and religious differences of immigrants as well as the potential economic competition they represented. This led to the rise of nativism, or discrimination and often violence against those born outside of the U. S., and the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know-Nothing Party in the 1840s and 1850s. Free African Americans and white European immigrants who both often faced discrimination and poverty also perceived each other as economic competition. This tension occasionally produced outbreaks of violence like the New York City Draft Riots of 1863 in which predominantly Catholic Irish and German immigrants, having been drafted into the U. S. Army but refusing to fight for Black freedom, rioted in response to the Emancipation Proclamation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P3'>Ultimately, the American Civil War placed native-born and foreign-born soldiers alongside each other in battle, cooling the nativist sentiments of the decades prior; however, non-European immigrants, especially Chinese-born, continued to face discrimination based on their immigrant status. (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 53-100; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD53477P0'>Refugees is describe as, "A person who leaves [their] home or country to find safety, especially during a war or for political or religious reasons." (Cambridge Dictionary) The American Civil War produced one of the United States' largest refugee crises in history. Scholars have traditionally divided refugees of the Civil War into three groups: African Americans, southern Unionists, and Confederates. One scholar notes that the approach of Union forces sparked the greatest number of refugees from all groups. While southern Unionists and enslaved African Americans fled to Union lines for sanctuary, pro-Confederate white southerners fled away from it for fear of punishment or capture.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD53477P1'>Formerly-enslaved African Americans composed the largest of these groups, as self-emancipated Black men, women, and children fled enslavement and forced the United States to reckon with the fate of enslavement in the nation's war aims. The Union Army established camps, known as "contraband camps" because of the Union stance that enslaved persons were technically contrabands of war, where African-American refugees lived and labored for the Union Army, albeit in often unsanitary, unsafe, and inadequate living conditions. Pro-Confederate, southern, white refugees were much smaller in number and largely represented the wealthier classes who could afford the costs of travel and relocation. These refugees most often gravitated toward cities and near railroad lines where they could return home if possible. Unionist refugees often fled their southern homes due to hostility from their pro-Confederate neighbors, late-war economic hardships, and fear of being drafted into the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD53477P2'>All three groups shared the enormous dangers of traveling on poorly constructed means of transportation in the South, vulnerability of women and children traveling outside of their local communities often for the first time, and the general lawlessness prevailing in war-wracked and desperate areas. The American Civil War therefore dislocated thousands of people of all backgrounds, and while many would go back to their former homes after the war, others would never return (Encyclopedia Virginia; David Silkenat, "Refugees and Movement in the Civil War," <hi rend='italic'>The Cambridge History of the American Civil War</hi>).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69344P0'>Stemming from the first century CE, Christianity is the world's largest religion with over two billion adherents. Its largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. A large influence on American identity and thought since the nation's founding, Christianity (particularly protestant evangelicalism) spread rapidly in the first three decades of the nineteenth century in the United States due to a series of religious revivals known as the Second Great Awakening. Many Americans injected Christian beliefs and practices into many of the major social, political, and legal debates in the country, including debates over slavery (both pro and antislavery stances), education, and social reform. Christianity also became a prominent religion among the enslaved in the United States, who employed Christian rhetoric and belief in much of their social, religious, and cultural activities, and critical to enslaved people's agency and resistance.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69344P1'>American Christianity in the nineteenth century primarily emphasized both one's individual responsibility to God as well as collective responsibility for one's neighbors. Also deeply important to American Christians in the nineteenth century was millennialism, or the belief that Jesus Christ would establish a 1,000 year reign of peace on earth. These combined elements produced efforts at reform with the intent to perfect society in order to invoke that reign. Many of the enslaved, however, applied millennialism to the hope of slavery's abolition. Numerous politicians also incorporated Christian imagery and language to justify "Manifest Destiny," or the idea that the God of Christianity ordained that the United States' borders would extend from the eastern to western coasts of North America, while both the Confederate and United States governments applied Christian rhetoric to support their causes. Christianity existed and still exists in many different and often competing forms, yet the development of those forms came to define much of American culture in the nineteenth century and beyond (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 285-327; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 8; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)

<p corresp='TTP32210624P9' xml:id='OTP32210624P9'>Thus:—we have been satisfied that in some special localities there is great destitu-tion. We have sent thither special supplies of food and clothing, not indeed endeavoring to supply all that were in want, but to provide as far as possible for cases of special need, the <rs ref='#S69274'>sick</rs>, the <rs ref='#S25003265'>infirm</rs>, and the <rs ref='#S73740'>delicate</rs>—

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210625P1' xml:id='OTP32210625P1'>We see the educational system broken up by war—many of the <rs ref='#S56589'>teachers</rs> gone—and the people as yet unprepared to support unaided, suitable schools. We have proffered our services in procuring in pro-curing teachers and assistance to maintain them until the necessity for such assistance has passed away—A proffer which we have found gladly accepted in the same spirit of fraternal feeling in which it was made. We desire however, to do what-ever is in our power to render such aid and co-operation as the people of different States and communities may desire and suggest—

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P1' xml:id='OTP32210627P1'>The work of the war is ended. The work of peace begins. The work of destruction of the last four years, terrible but necessary, must be followed by an era of construction even more sublime. In the regions which war has desolated a free Christian State must be reared.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P2' xml:id='OTP32210627P2'>The work of re-construction is partly political; and this will require the highest wisdom of our <rs ref='#S63972'>statesmen</rs>. It is partly religious; and for this every Christian denomination is preparing. But there is also a great intermediate work of patriotism and philanthropy, neither political nor denominational. Thousands of homeless wanderers, destitute, utterly wretched, require temporary relief; thousands have been already provided by this Commission with permanent homes and employment; and many more still need assistance.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P3' xml:id='OTP32210627P3'>Comprehensive and systematic measures are now required to re-establish industrial, social and educational systems in the States which have been the theatre of the war. Desolated homes must be rebuilt, <rs ref='#S91218'>farms</rs> must be stocked and supplied with seed and implements; <rs ref='#S25025732'>emigration</rs> <hi rend='italic'>of a right character</hi> must be stimulated and guided; schools must be opened, and furnished with the necessary apparatus; free school systems must be organized and established; and the intelligence and patriotism of the whole people must be furthered by a well conducted <rs ref='#S99620'>press</rs>.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P4' xml:id='OTP32210627P4'>These measures of social re-organization should be superintended mainly by persons of undoubted loyalty, of practical wisdom, and positive sympathy with freedom, who have long resided in the regions to be thus benefited, and who are familiar with the temper and habits of the people. But aid and co-operation from the citizens of the more prosperous States will be greatly needed and gladly welcomed. To afford that aid and co-operation the American Union Commission is organized.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P5' xml:id='OTP32210627P5'>It consists of a Central Commission, having its office in New York City, with branches already organized in <rs ref='#S73324'>Boston</rs>, <rs ref='#S63067'>Baltimore</rs>, <rs ref='#S32023084'>Chicago</rs>, <rs ref='#S63452'>Cincinnati</rs>, <rs ref='#S63133'>Nashville</rs>, <rs ref='#S63093'>Richmond</rs> and <rs ref='#S63354'>Charleston</rs>. In its origin it had the sanction of President <rs ref='#S52243'>Lincoln</rs>; it now enjoys the cordial approbation of President <rs ref='#S52439'>Johnson</rs>; it receives from the <rs ref='#S76355'>War Department</rs> transportation and other facilities so far as is consistent with the public service; and in providing for <rs ref='#S53477'>refugees</rs>, it is in hearty co-operation with the <rs ref='#S54857'>Bureau for Refugees and Freedmen</rs>, who are still, as heretofore, dependent on voluntary contributions, through benevolent societies, for needful assistance. Its object is defined with precision by the following fundamental article of its Constitution.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P6' xml:id='OTP32210627P6'><hi rend='italic'>"The American Union Commission is constituted for the purpose of aiding and co-operating with the people of those portions of the United States which have been desolated and impoverished by the war, in the restoration of their civil and social condition, upon the basis of industry, education, freedom, and Christian morality."</hi>
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P7' xml:id='OTP32210627P7'>In the prosecution of this general purpose, the Commission contemplates the following specific objects:
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P8' xml:id='OTP32210627P8'>1.—The relief of immediate want and suffering by the distribution of food, clothing and medicine.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P9' xml:id='OTP32210627P9'>2.—The restoration and encouragement of domestic industry, by assisting the people to obtain seed, implements, and improved farming utensils, and other machinery.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P10' xml:id='OTP32210627P10'>3.—The encouragement of a healthful emigration, by the publication of trustworthy information as to the character and price of lands.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P11' xml:id='OTP32210627P11'>4.—The introduction of accredited teachers to local agencies, assistance in the establishment of permanent systems of public education, and, when necessary, the temporary maintenance of schools by voluntary contributions.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P12' xml:id='OTP32210627P12'>5.—The encouragement of a patriotic devotion to the Union and Liberty, by assisting to establish an intelligent and independent press.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32210627P13' xml:id='OTP32210627P13'>This work is not one of charity but of patriotism. We have but one country. In the welfare of every part of the United States all Americans possess an equal interest. The nation cannot enjoy prosperity while one half the land remains crippled, desolated. We appeal then to all Americans to unite in the work of restoring the civil and social institutions of the country. We ask the clergy who have so well instructed their people in the duty of patriotic self sacrifice, to instruct them in the no less imperative duty of patriotic beneficence. We urge the women of America to continue in behalf of their destitute countrymen, the labors which have so abundantly provided for the soldier. And in the name of all lovers of their country, we proffer to the loyalists of the South, in their difficult task of restoration, our hearty sympathies and material aid.
