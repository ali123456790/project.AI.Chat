                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32028021P0'>Henry Warner Slocum was a Union general during the Civil War and a U.S. congressman from New York.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P1'>Born on September 24, 1827, in Delphi Falls, New York, he proved an intelligent and studious individual, earning a teaching certificate at the age of 16. After teaching for a few years, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1852. Slocum served for four years in the U.S. Army, participating in the Third Seminole War in Florida before resigning his commission in 1856 and moving to Syracuse, New York. He studied law for two years, and then was admitted as a practicing attorney in Syracuse in 1858. Within a year, Slocum was elected county treasurer and then was elected to the New York State Assembly.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Slocum volunteered for Union military service. He received a commission as colonel in command of the Twenty-Seventh New York Infantry Regiment. He led that unit during the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, receiving a severe wound. When he recovered enough to return to field service, Slocum was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of a brigade in the Army of the Potomac. By May 1862, he was in command of a division and led it with distinction during the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond, Virginia, receiving high praise from Union officers. In July 1862, at the age of 34, he was promoted to major general. He continued to perform well in battle, playing a conspicuous role in the Battle of South Mountain in September 1862 and the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P3'>Slocum played a vital, but somewhat unappreciated, role at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. On July 2, when ordered to relocate his XII Corps south in response to a Confederate assault on the Union left flank, Slocum wisely recognized the risk such move would cause to the Union army’s right flank at Culp’s Hill. He ordered one of his brigades to remain in defense of that position, which likely saved the Union Army from defeat at Gettysburg when that brigade repelled a massive Confederate assault upon Culp’s Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P4'>In the fall of 1863, Slocum was transferred to the western theater. He initially received command of a division tasked with protecting the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. However, in the summer of 1864, he received command of the XVII Corps in Tennessee and the District of Vicksburg. General Ulysses S. Grant was so impressed with Slocum’s management of the Vicksburg district that he wished to keep him in that position and delayed Slocum’s reassignment to field command in Georgia. Eventually, though, Slocum joined William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union force during the campaign for Atlanta, taking command of the XX Corps. He effectively led the corps during the campaign, resulting in his troops being the first to march into Atlanta when the city surrendered in. September 1864. He was then placed in charge of Union occupation forces in Atlanta for more than two months, showing compassion and efficiency in his duties.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P5'>Slocum received command of the Army of Georgia and supported Sherman’s march across Georgia to Savannah. His army did not see any major engagements during that campaign, but did see intense action in the subsequent Carolinas Campaign. When the Civil War ended in 1865, Slocum was among the most successful and respected Union generals.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P6'>Shortly after hostilities ended, Slocum resigned from the army and turned to civilian life. He unsuccessfully ran for the Secretary of State position in New York, then began a law practice. In 1868, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat and served two terms. After practicing law in the 1870s he again won a congressional seat in 1882 and served a single term. During his time in public office and as an attorney, Slocum was active in promoting infrastructure development in New York, including the construction and expansion of street cars and bridges.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P7'>Slocum died on April 14, 1894. He was married to Carolina A. Rice and had three children. Slocum is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32025299P0'>George Henry Thomas was a career U.S. Army officer who served as a Union general during the Civil War and commanded various military departments in the south during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P1'>Born on July 31, 1816, at Newsom’s Depot, Virginia, Thomas entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1836 at the age of 20—older than most cadets—leading to his nickname “Old Tom.” He became close friends with his roommate, William Tecumseh Sherman, and graduated in 1840. Thomas was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army and undertook military assignments in Florida during the Seminole Wars, as well as at various forts and posts in Louisiana, Maryland and South Carolina. He then went to Texas at the outbreak of the Mexican-American War in 1846 and served bravely as an artillery officer at Fort Brown, Resaca de La Palma, Monterrey, and Buena Vista. Thomas repeatedly promoted for bravery by the time the war ended in 1848.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P2'>In the early 1850s, Thomas served as a cavalry and artillery instructor at West Point. He then transferred to California as a cavalry officer and spent several years in the western territories, conducting campaigns against Native Americans. In 1860, he was shot in the chest by an arrow during a battle with Comanche warriors at Clear Fork along the Brazos River in Texas. Fortunately for Thomas, due to the angle or velocity of the arrow, he received only a severe flesh wound and the remained in the field after patching the wound.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, many people in the U.S. Army believed Thomas would follow his native state into the Confederacy. Beyond his southern background (and experience in a slave society while growing up in Virginia), Thomas had strong relationships through his military service with men who would be among the Confederacy’s leading figures, such as Braxton Bragg, Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, J.E.B. Stuart, and Fitzhugh Lee. However, Thomas rejected secession and chose to stay loyal to the United States and was quickly promoted to brigadier of volunteers in the Union army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P4'>Many Union officials initially treated Thomas with suspicion due to his southern roots. However, he earned respect from his effective leadership. Initially serving in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, Thomas was sent westward to train and lead Kentucky volunteers for the Union. He scored an important moral victory for the Union in January 1862 at the Battle of Mill Springs in Kentucky, further boosting his reputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P5'>In the spring of 1862, Thomas received a promotion to major general. Over the next several months he commanded Union troops at Corinth, Mississippi, and then during operations in Kentucky and Tennessee. He played a conspicuous part in the Battle of Stones River (or Murfreesboro) in late December 1862 and early January 1863, but has drawn the most praise for his performance at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863. When Confederate forces broke through part of the Union line at that battle, Thomas held a strong defensive position that prevented the entire army from collapsing. He earned the nickname the “Rock of Chickamauga,” and promotion to command of the Army of the Cumberland when his superior, William S. Rosecrans, was relieved after the fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P6'>Thomas continued to score important battlefield victories at Chattanooga, Tennessee, in November 1863 and then in support of William Tecumseh Sherman’s capture of Atlanta, Georgia, in 1864. When Confederate forces under General John Bell Hood moved into Tennessee in the fall of 1864, in an effort to threaten Sherman’s supply line and draw Union forces out of Georgia, Thomas led his Army of the Cumberland against Hood while Sherman conducted his famous “march to the seat” campaign across Georgia to Savannah. Thomas’s army was smaller than Hood’s, but he successfully outmaneuvered the Confederate force to unit with Union reinforcements under Major General John Schofield and defeat Hood at the Battle of Franklin. Thomas then led the crushing defeat of Hood’s army at the Battle of Nashville. Following these victories, Thomas received a promotion to major general in the Regular Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025299P7'>After the Civil War, Thomas variously commanded military departments in Kentucky and Tennessee, West Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama. He oversaw federal Reconstruction efforts in parts of the former Confederacy and used his military authority to better protect the rights of African Americans. Thomas turned down a promotion to lieutenant general and the possibility of replacing Ulysses S. Grant as general in chief because he wanted to avoid the bitter political battle raging within the higher military and political ranks. Instead, in 1869, he asked to be sent to California to command the Military Division of the Pacific. He died of a stroke at his headquarters on March 28, 1870. Thomas was married to Frances Kellogg. He is buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Troy, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99399P0'>Plantations are farms that typically grow cash crops, and often specialize in a single product, such as cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane. Plantation farming continues in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century, especially for crops like coffee beans, rubber trees, and cocoa. In American history the term plantation is most often associated with estates in the American south. Historical descriptions of plantations generate images of large farming operations. However, even moderately-sized southern farms that planted cash crops were sometimes referred to as plantations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P1'>Southern plantations before the Civil War were strongly tied to the institution of slavery. As profit-driven agricultural operations, plantations required large numbers of laborers. This fed the demand for African slave importation to the British colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and bolstered the defense of slavery among southern planters in the nineteenth century. Plantation crops varied by region within the south, with rice being popular in Georgia and South Carolina along the Atlantic coast, tobacco being an early cash crop in Virginia, and then—after the invention of the cotton gin at the end of the eighteenth century which quickly separated seeds from the cotton fibers—the boom in cotton growing across the Deep South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P2'>By 1860, there were approximately 46,200 plantations across the south. More than 20,000 had twenty to thirty slaves. Only about 2,300, or five percent, had one hundred or more slaves. The enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work. The plantations were their home. The same was not always true for the plantation owners. The very large operations frequently had wealthy absentee owners, who resided in cities or other states, leaving plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers. Slave cabins, or slave quarters, were a ubiquitous part of a plantation. They represented the heart of the laborers’ community on the property, but were usually of basic construction and few amenities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P3'>Following the abolition of slavery after the Civil War, many freed people continued to live on plantations. Sharecropping became a popular arrangement between the landowners and the laborers. The property was often divided into plots with tenants assigned to certain sections. The system involved a contract or arrangement which allowed the laborer, or tenant, to keep a portion of the crop they raised. The system was abused, and developed a negative reputation for the level of poverty many sharecroppers (mostly Black, but some white) experienced on plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Representatives of the Freedmen’s Bureau sought to protect Black sharecroppers by regulating contracts during Reconstruction, but the withdrawal of federal officials after 1876 left many African American tenants more subject to unfair sharecropping contracts on the old plantations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32035127P0'>The United States Army Department of Mississippi was a geographical command established on November 28, 1864. It was headquartered in Vicksburg and encompassed the states of Mississippi and Tennessee west of the Tennessee River. On January 17, 1865 the areas of Mississippi occupied by forces under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas were detached to the Department of the Cumberland, followed by western Tennessee on February 10, 1865. On May 17, 1865 western Mississippi was detached to the Department of the Gulf and re-attached on June 27, 1865. It was discontinued on August 6, 1866, its territory merged into the Department of the Tennessee.

              <value>From the Mississippi Department of Archives and History Governor Sharkey Collection. Letter from Mississippi Governor William L. Sharkey at Jackson, Mississippi, to Major General Henry W. Slocum, concerning a legal case in Warren County, Mississippi, in which a plantation owner sued to regain his leased property. A Colonel Thomas allegedly arrested one of the justices of the peace who tried the case after judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. Sharkey regards Thomas&#39;s actions as unbecoming, and he asks Slocum to &quot;furnish the [Warren County] sheriff with sufficient military force&quot; to execute the court&#39;s judgment. Also included is a hand-transcribed copy of Sharkey&#39;s letter to Slocum (possibly transcribed by a member of either Sharkey or Slocum&#39;s staff).</value>
