                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63104P0'>The Whig Party was a national political party in the United States from 1833 to 1860. During its roughly twenty-five years of existence, it stood as one of two major political parties (the other being the Democratic Party) that dominated American national politics. Four U.S. presidents were elected as Whig candidates, and several leading American congressmen and statesmen identified as Whigs. The party generally opposed aggressive American expansion westward, and denounced the Mexican War. Whigs supported protective tariffs, federal support for infrastructure, and the national bank.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63104P1'>The Whig Party, like the Democratic Party, had members across the United States. It struggled to remain united during debates over slavery. Northern Whigs tended to be more hostile to slavery than northern Democrats, and the overtly anti-slavery parties, such as the Free Soil Party, in the late 1840s and early 1850s were primarily made up of former Whigs. After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved restrictions against slavery in the territories, thousands of northern Whigs, disgruntled northern Democrats, and Free Soil members formed the Republican Party as a major national political organization. The Whig Party remained cohesive enough to put a candidate on the 1856 presidential ballot, but the results of that election proved that the Republican Party had supplanted the Whigs in political power. The Whig Party fell apart over the next few years, in large part because Republicans adopted many of the Whig Party’s economic policies. Conservative Whigs in the south tried to inhabit a middle ground during the contentious 1860 presidential debate by forming the Constitutional Union Party that opposed secession and avoided taking sides on the slavery debate. This effort meant the end of the Whig Party as a viable party in American politics. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P0'>A Unionist was "a member or supporter of the twenty-three Northern states that were not part of the seceding Confederacy during the American Civil War" (Wikipedia). Unionism in the South took on a variety of forms and encompassed many different beliefs. While most northerners sided with the Union, many southerners did as well. Even prior to secession, no solid white South existed, as many white southerners in mountainous and upcountry areas of the South did not own enslaved persons. While some areas like eastern Tennessee and parts of northern Alabama rejected secession outright for the entire war, secession produced renewed patriotism for many non-enslaving whites in the South. That patriotism faltered for many as the awful realities of wartime violence and poverty struck even as early as 1861. Many poor white southerners viewed the Confederacy's conscription, impressment, and taxation policies as elitist, forcing many families to, if not support the Union per se, at least oppose the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P1'>Entire unionist communities developed throughout the war to shield those loyal to the Union or opposed to the Confederacy, as well as deserters from the Confederate Army and, in certain cases, escaped enslaved persons. Southern unionism often led to internal armed conflict between southerners, as bands of guerilla fighters raided Confederate depots and shipping for supplies and even attacked some Confederate units. While unionist strongholds most frequently developed in the mountainous regions of the South and the border states, Unionism spread throughout the entire Confederacy, including one of the most notable in Jones County, Mississippi, where ex-Confederate soldier Newton Knight and roughly 500 others formed the so-called "Free State of Jones" and opposed Confederate forces until the war's end. The presence of Unionism across the South stifled the Confederate war effort in many ways and revealed that tensions of national loyalty, race, class, and gender remained complicated even for southern whites (American Heritage; Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

I therefore hope he will meet with your favorable consideration and that he may be ^by^ your Exc<add place='above'>l</add> recommended for the office
