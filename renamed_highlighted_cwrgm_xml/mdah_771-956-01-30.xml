                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS62969P0'>William Henry Seward was a politician from New York who served as United States Secretary of State during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P1'>Born in Florida, New York, on May 16, 1801, Seward was educated at local schools and graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York, in 1820. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in Auburn, New York. Soon afterwards, he became involved in politics. He joined the Whig Party and won a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1830. He proved quite popular within the Whig Party and received the party’s nomination for governor of New York in 1834. He lost the election and resumed practicing law in Auburn, New York, but retained his standing with the party. Four years later, Seward won the 1838 gubernatorial election and served as governor until 1842. In office, Seward proved sympathetic to African American residents of New York, signing several laws that protected Black rights. He also supported laws that gave fugitive slaves who fled to the state from the south right to jury trials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P2'>Upon leaving the governor’s office, Seward returned to practicing law in Auburn. In 1849, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and became a leading anti-slavery voice in Washington, D.C. In the mid-1850s, with the slavery debate dominating national politics and leading to the dissolution of the Whig Party, Seward joined the new Republican Party. His long history of anti-slavery advocacy and stellar political resume made him a top contender for the Republican Party’s nomination for president in 1860. However, he lost the nomination to Abraham Lincoln, whose western roots and more moderate anti-slavery reputation appealed to more Republicans. Additionally, Seward’s previous political support of immigrant rights and association with infamous political boss Thurlow Weed in New York were unpopular among many Republicans and worked against his nomination.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P3'>Seward was initially dismissive of Lincoln, due to the latter's unrefined background and mannerisms, and his political inexperience. (Lincoln’s previous time in Washington, D.C., amounted to a single term in the U.S. House of Representatives in the late 1840s.) However, Seward backed Lincoln as the party candidate during the 1860 presidential election. When Lincoln won the presidency, he selected Seward for U.S. Secretary of State.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P4'>During the secession crisis that followed the 1860 election, Seward used his political connections in a vain effort to prevent southern states from seceding and to facilitate peace within the already contentious situation. He took a stronger public position during the crisis than Lincoln, who remained relatively quiet during the period between the election in November 1860 and inauguration in March 1861. Seward generally supported Lincoln’s policies, and the two privately coordinated many of Seward’s actions in response to secession, but Seward privately believed he would be a guiding figure for the new president in the upcoming administration. Additionally, Seward overestimated the power he would hold over Lincoln in regards to foreign affairs. Despite his overestimation of his influence, and his doubts of Lincoln’s abilities, Seward’s opinion of the president changed as the war progressed. By the summer of 1861, Seward privately praised Lincoln as calm, measured, and a quick learner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P5'>Lincoln and Seward worked well together, with the president respecting his secretary’s suggestions regarding policy and political timing. For example, in the summer of 1862, when Lincoln privately informed his cabinet that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation—declaring that all slaves in Confederate areas would be considered free by federal authorities—Seward urged cautioned. Seward’s anti-slavery sentiments were beyond reproach, but he argued that that the public would interpret a bold executive action as desperation by an administration losing the war. Seward advised Lincoln to wait and announce it after a great Union military victory. Lincoln agreed with this advice and held on to the proclamation for nearly two months, until Union forces defeated Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Antietam, Maryland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P6'>Preventing foreign interference in the Civil War was among Seward’s most important jobs. He proved more aggressive in his opposition to European countries who flirted with the idea of supporting the Confederacy. Lincoln took a more moderate stance, determined to avoid going to war with a foreign power while in the midst of fighting the Confederacy. Ultimately, Seward helped present a strong and determined U.S. government dedicated to defeating secession and, after the announcement of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, ending slavery, which kept Britain and France officially neutral.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P7'>On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth shot and mortally wounded President Lincoln at a play in Washington, D.C. Simultaneously, an associate of Booth, named Lewis Powell, tried to assassinate Seward. The secretary of state was bedridden at his townhouse in Washington, D.C., with a broken jaw following a carriage accident. Powell gained access into Seward’s home by claiming to have medicine. Seward’s son Frederick stopped Powell inside the house and asked for the medicine. Powell drew a revolver and tried to shoot the young man. The gun misfired, so Powell hit Frederick in the head with the handgun, stunning him, and rushed into Seward’s room. He attacked Seward, who was laying on his bed, with a knife, stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck. A Union soldier and another of Seward’s sons, Augustus, who were in the room charged Powell and eventually forced him to run from the house. In total, five men were wounded by Powell during the attack—Seward, two of his sons, the military guard, and a messenger who Powell stabbed while running out of the house. They all survived. Seward was badly wounded, but a metal brace supporting his face and neck deflected Powell’s slashes, preventing any of his injuries from being mortal. Powell was subsequently found and arrested by military authorities. He was executed on July 7, 1865, by hanging with three other people convicted of plotting or aiding in the assassination of Lincoln and other federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P8'>Seward’s recovery took several weeks, at which time Vice President Andrew Johnson took Lincoln’s place in the White House. When he returned to his duties, he tried to maintain a good working relationship with Johnson, but found himself defending the increasingly unpopular president against radicals within the Republican Party. Seward’s most notable act as secretary of state after the Civil War was his purchase of Alaska territory from Russia in 1867. He negotiated the entire purchase for $7.2 million (roughly $120 million today). Initially lambasted by political rivals as “Seward’s Folly,” who complained that the secretary of state had spent millions of dollars on distant section of undeveloped land while the country still had numerous western territories, attitudes changed within a few years when prospectors fond gold in Alaska and many other settlers learned of the great natural resources there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P9'>Seward’s tenure as secretary of state ended with the inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant as president in 1869. He retired from public office and traveled around the world. Three years later, on October 10, 1872, he died, only hours after first complaining of shortness of breath. He had been married to Frances Adeline Miller, who had passed away in 1865. The couple had six children. Seward is buried at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS63059P0'>Milton Slocum Latham was an attorney and politician who served as governor, congressman, and senator from California in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63059P1'>Born on May 23, 1827, in Columbus, Ohio, Latham graduated from Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845. He moved to Alabama and worked as a teacher while studying law. He became a practicing attorney in that state in 1848 and then worked as a circuit court clerk until 1850. Latham then moved to San Francisco, California, where he became the district attorney of Sacramento in 1851.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63059P2'>In 1852, Latham won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served one term before returning to California to practice law. He then accepted an appointment as U.S. Customs Collector at San Francisco and held that position until 1857. In 1859, he won a hotly contested gubernatorial election as a Democrat sympathetic to slavery expanding into the territories. However, only five days into his term, he resigned to fill a vacant California seat in the U.S. Senate. Latham served in that legislative body until 1863, when he lost reelection.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63059P3'>After leaving the Senate, Latham took a job as the chief of the San Francisco branch of the London and San Francisco Bank Ltd. He became a major proponent and financier of the California Pacific and the North Pacific Coast Railroad. In 1879, he moved to New York City and became a leading executive of the New York Mining Stock Exchange. He died on March 4, 1882. Latham was married twice, first to Sophie Birdsall. She died in 1867. He later married Mary McMullin. He had at least one child. Latham is buried in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
