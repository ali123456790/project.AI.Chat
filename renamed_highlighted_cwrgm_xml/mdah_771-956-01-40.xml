                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027472P0'>Hugh McCulloch was a businessman, banker, and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P1'>Born in Kennebunk, Maine, on December 7, 1808, McCulloch was educated in New England before moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1833 to practice law. Shortly afterwards, in 1835, he began working at the Bank of Indiana, rising from cashier to manager of the Fort Wayne branch, then to president of the overall company. He remained at the bank until 1863, when he was appointed by Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase to be Comptroller of the Currency. McCulloch proved very capable in that role, recommending changes to banking laws and seeing widespread success among banks in the northern states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P2'>In March 1865, President Abraham Lincoln offered McCulloch the position of Secretary of the Treasury. He reluctantly accepted the job, and proved successful at reducing the national debt. He opposed the widespread use of paper currency and labored to reduce paper bills in circulation. The effort was not popular and was eventually halted by Congress. When his term as secretary ended in 1869, McCulloch moved to England and worked as a partner in the banking firm of Jay Cooke, McCulloch &amp; Co. McCulloch was called again to public service in 1884, when President Chester A. Arthur appointed him as Secretary of the Treasury. He served only six months, until March 1885, when Arthur’s presidential term ended.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P3'>McCulloch died on May 24, 1895. He had been married twice, first to Eunice Hardy who died in 1836, only two years after their wedding. He then married Susan Man in 1838 and had at least five children. McCulloch is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
