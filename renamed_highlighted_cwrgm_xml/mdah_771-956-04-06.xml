                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P0'>When the Civil War began in 1861, the United States Army did not allow African American volunteers to enlist. In July of 1862, however, Congress passed the Confiscation Act, which freed the slaves of people in rebellion against the United States, and then passed the Militia Act, which authorized President Abraham Lincoln to accept African Americans into military service. Lincoln did not immediately change the policy of enlisting only white soldiers, partially due to concern that such action would inflame tensions within the tenuously loyal Border States. However, that same summer, some Union officers independently saw opportunities to recruit liberated Southern slaves and free Blacks to enlarge their understrength military forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P1'>The first Black regiments were raised by General David Hunter in the Union-controlled coastal area of South Carolina in the summer of 1862. Although that effort eventually ended after a few weeks, additional Black regiments emerged in Kansas the same year to assist in guarding that state’s border and in Louisiana around Union-occupied New Orleans. Initially, many people believed these African American units would be used for manual labor and menial tasks, such as digging trenches and guarding supply trains, thereby releasing white units from those duties in order to fight. However, the great need for combat troops meant that Black soldiers were called to the front lines relatively quickly. The First Kansas Colored Infantry was the first Black unit to see combat during the Civil War, when it defeated pro-Confederate guerrillas at Island Mound, Missouri, on October 29, 1862, before the regiment had finished recruiting.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P2'>Those initial African American units were isolated and raised by local military commanders that did not have authority to change national policy. Federal policy did change on January 1, 1863, however, when Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. The act announced that all enslaved persons in Confederate areas were declared free and it authorized the United States Army to formally accept Black volunteers for military service. Lincoln described this action as one of necessity to preserve the Union. The policy to allow Black volunteers significantly boosted the military’s manpower. Over the next two years, nearly 180,000 African American men served the Union in uniform, making up almost 10% of the army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P3'>Early Black units were raised similarly to most white volunteer regiments, as in recruited and placed into organizations according to their state. Some notable examples include the First Kansas Colored Infantry, First and Second Louisiana Native Guard Regiments, and the Fifty-Fourth and Fifty-Fifth Massachusetts Infantry Regiments. However, in May 1863, the War Department established the Bureau of Colored Troops to oversee the recruiting and organization of African American soldiers. Units accepted into federal service were designated United States Colored Troops (USCT). The units were primarily commanded by white officers; however, African American soldiers served as non-commissioned officers (such as corporals and sergeants), and by the end of the war a small number of Black soldiers did attain commissions as officers. Over 93,000 USCT soldiers were recruited in Union-occupied areas of the South. The rest were recruited in northern communities, among the pre-war free Black population as well as some escaped slaves who had reached freedom in the North. Some of the early state-designated Black units were also absorbed into the federal army with new USCT designations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P4'>The United States Army’s use of African American soldiers enraged Confederates. Black men carrying firearms provoked images of slave rebellion, a great fear in Southern antebellum culture. The Confederate government passed a resolution calling for the execution of white Union officers commanding Black soldiers for inciting servile insurrection, and recommended enslavement of Black Union soldiers captured in battle. The Lincoln administration responded that African American soldiers in the U.S. Army were legitimate combatants and threatened to execute a Confederate prisoner for each soldier or officer killed under Confederate policy, and to put a Confederate soldier into hard labor for every captured African American soldier sent into slavery. Because of this response, the Confederate government backed down. However, Black Union soldiers and their white officers were still sometimes subjected to reprisals on the battlefield. Some of the most notable reports of Confederate atrocities against Black Union prisoners occurred at places like Fort Pillow in Tennessee, Poison Spring in Arkansas, and Olustee in Florida.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32002856P5'>Black units played conspicuous roles in several battles, especially during the last twelve months of the war, receiving praise from numerous Union military officers. Overall, approximately 20% of African American soldiers died in military service during the Civil War, from combat, disease, or accidents. During the months following the Civil War, the federal government significantly downsized the military, releasing the state volunteer units from service and restructuring the permanent, regular army force to forty-five infantry regiments. Four were African American units. Although still segregated from their white counterparts, the United States Army continued to include Black units within its structure, proving that African American volunteers had earned a permanent place in the American military.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

<p corresp='TTP32217565P4' xml:id='OTP32217565P4'>Since the "<rs ref='#S57096'>negro</rs> <rs ref='#S32002856'>garrison</rs>" came to <rs ref='#S63302'>Canton</rs> the negroes of this <rs ref='#S70273'>county</rs> have been unmanageble—while previously they were quiet &amp; obedient, and industrious. It is the conviction of the Citizens that it would have been far better for all parties if there had never been a garrison in Canton, and that it ought to be removed for the good of the negroes who have made contracts to work.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32217565P5' xml:id='OTP32217565P5'>2ndly. The negroes have an idea that by the first of Jan next the lands are to be divided out among them. And when they are told that such a thing will not be done some of them reply: "Then we will <rs ref='#S63926'>kill</rs> the whites from the cradle up &amp; take the lands." The stock of every character—tools, crops, are all to be divided, too
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32217565P6' xml:id='OTP32217565P6'>Now, do you not think that negroes who make such <rs ref='#S99687'>threats</rs> ought to be <rs ref='#S62954'>arrested</rs> and put in <rs ref='#S62926'>jail</rs>? Do you not think, too, that the citizens ought to be armed so that they may be prepared to defend themselves
