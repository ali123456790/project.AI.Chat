                    <p xml:id='OTPS62969P0'>William Henry Seward was a politician from New York who served as United States Secretary of State during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P1'>Born in Florida, New York, on May 16, 1801, Seward was educated at local schools and graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York, in 1820. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in Auburn, New York. Soon afterwards, he became involved in politics. He joined the Whig Party and won a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1830. He proved quite popular within the Whig Party and received the party’s nomination for governor of New York in 1834. He lost the election and resumed practicing law in Auburn, New York, but retained his standing with the party. Four years later, Seward won the 1838 gubernatorial election and served as governor until 1842. In office, Seward proved sympathetic to African American residents of New York, signing several laws that protected Black rights. He also supported laws that gave fugitive slaves who fled to the state from the south right to jury trials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P2'>Upon leaving the governor’s office, Seward returned to practicing law in Auburn. In 1849, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and became a leading anti-slavery voice in Washington, D.C. In the mid-1850s, with the slavery debate dominating national politics and leading to the dissolution of the Whig Party, Seward joined the new Republican Party. His long history of anti-slavery advocacy and stellar political resume made him a top contender for the Republican Party’s nomination for president in 1860. However, he lost the nomination to Abraham Lincoln, whose western roots and more moderate anti-slavery reputation appealed to more Republicans. Additionally, Seward’s previous political support of immigrant rights and association with infamous political boss Thurlow Weed in New York were unpopular among many Republicans and worked against his nomination.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P3'>Seward was initially dismissive of Lincoln, due to the latter's unrefined background and mannerisms, and his political inexperience. (Lincoln’s previous time in Washington, D.C., amounted to a single term in the U.S. House of Representatives in the late 1840s.) However, Seward backed Lincoln as the party candidate during the 1860 presidential election. When Lincoln won the presidency, he selected Seward for U.S. Secretary of State.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P4'>During the secession crisis that followed the 1860 election, Seward used his political connections in a vain effort to prevent southern states from seceding and to facilitate peace within the already contentious situation. He took a stronger public position during the crisis than Lincoln, who remained relatively quiet during the period between the election in November 1860 and inauguration in March 1861. Seward generally supported Lincoln’s policies, and the two privately coordinated many of Seward’s actions in response to secession, but Seward privately believed he would be a guiding figure for the new president in the upcoming administration. Additionally, Seward overestimated the power he would hold over Lincoln in regards to foreign affairs. Despite his overestimation of his influence, and his doubts of Lincoln’s abilities, Seward’s opinion of the president changed as the war progressed. By the summer of 1861, Seward privately praised Lincoln as calm, measured, and a quick learner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P5'>Lincoln and Seward worked well together, with the president respecting his secretary’s suggestions regarding policy and political timing. For example, in the summer of 1862, when Lincoln privately informed his cabinet that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation—declaring that all slaves in Confederate areas would be considered free by federal authorities—Seward urged cautioned. Seward’s anti-slavery sentiments were beyond reproach, but he argued that that the public would interpret a bold executive action as desperation by an administration losing the war. Seward advised Lincoln to wait and announce it after a great Union military victory. Lincoln agreed with this advice and held on to the proclamation for nearly two months, until Union forces defeated Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Antietam, Maryland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P6'>Preventing foreign interference in the Civil War was among Seward’s most important jobs. He proved more aggressive in his opposition to European countries who flirted with the idea of supporting the Confederacy. Lincoln took a more moderate stance, determined to avoid going to war with a foreign power while in the midst of fighting the Confederacy. Ultimately, Seward helped present a strong and determined U.S. government dedicated to defeating secession and, after the announcement of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, ending slavery, which kept Britain and France officially neutral.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P7'>On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth shot and mortally wounded President Lincoln at a play in Washington, D.C. Simultaneously, an associate of Booth, named Lewis Powell, tried to assassinate Seward. The secretary of state was bedridden at his townhouse in Washington, D.C., with a broken jaw following a carriage accident. Powell gained access into Seward’s home by claiming to have medicine. Seward’s son Frederick stopped Powell inside the house and asked for the medicine. Powell drew a revolver and tried to shoot the young man. The gun misfired, so Powell hit Frederick in the head with the handgun, stunning him, and rushed into Seward’s room. He attacked Seward, who was laying on his bed, with a knife, stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck. A Union soldier and another of Seward’s sons, Augustus, who were in the room charged Powell and eventually forced him to run from the house. In total, five men were wounded by Powell during the attack—Seward, two of his sons, the military guard, and a messenger who Powell stabbed while running out of the house. They all survived. Seward was badly wounded, but a metal brace supporting his face and neck deflected Powell’s slashes, preventing any of his injuries from being mortal. Powell was subsequently found and arrested by military authorities. He was executed on July 7, 1865, by hanging with three other people convicted of plotting or aiding in the assassination of Lincoln and other federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P8'>Seward’s recovery took several weeks, at which time Vice President Andrew Johnson took Lincoln’s place in the White House. When he returned to his duties, he tried to maintain a good working relationship with Johnson, but found himself defending the increasingly unpopular president against radicals within the Republican Party. Seward’s most notable act as secretary of state after the Civil War was his purchase of Alaska territory from Russia in 1867. He negotiated the entire purchase for $7.2 million (roughly $120 million today). Initially lambasted by political rivals as “Seward’s Folly,” who complained that the secretary of state had spent millions of dollars on distant section of undeveloped land while the country still had numerous western territories, attitudes changed within a few years when prospectors fond gold in Alaska and many other settlers learned of the great natural resources there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P9'>Seward’s tenure as secretary of state ended with the inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant as president in 1869. He retired from public office and traveled around the world. Three years later, on October 10, 1872, he died, only hours after first complaining of shortness of breath. He had been married to Frances Adeline Miller, who had passed away in 1865. The couple had six children. Seward is buried at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

He served in the U.S. Army for nine years, participating in the Black Hawk War and seeing assignments at various western outposts. He resigned in 1835 and returned to Mississippi to become a cotton planter with money and land loaned to him by an older brother.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P2'>Davis married Sarah Taylor, daughter of General (and future president) Zachary Taylor, in 1835. However, the couple contracted malaria and Sarah died three months after their wedding. Davis focused on developing his plantation in Mississippi over the next few years, purchasing additional slaves, and expanding his planting operations. By 1840 he owned 40 people, and over the next twenty years he nearly tripled the number of slaves on his property, owning 113 slaves by 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P3'>In 1840 Davis became active in Democratic politics in Mississippi. He served as a delegate to various state conventions, and was selected to be a Democratic elector for the 1844 presidential election. That same year, the 35-year old Davis met 18-year old Varina Banks Howell, the daughter of another Mississippi planter. They married in 1845 and ultimately had six children. In 1845, Davis also won his first election to political office, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi. The next year, he voted for the United States to go to war against Mexico, and left Congress to raise a regiment of Mississippians for the Mexican-American War. Davis and his First Mississippi Regiment, nicknamed the “Mississippi Rifles,” served under his former father-in-law, General Taylor, in Mexico, seeing action in several battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P4'>In 1847, before the Mexican-American War ended, Davis accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Mississippian Jesse Speight. He used his position within the Senate to advocate the expansion of slavery into the western territories. By the time famed South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun passed away in 1850, Davis was among the most prominent defenders of southern interests in Washington, D.C., and he argued against policies and legislation that limited or restricted slavery. He resigned from his Senate seat in 1851 to run for governor of Mississippi, but lost a narrow election to Henry S. Foote. Instead of returning to the Senate, Davis resumed life on his plantation in Mississippi, but remained in touch with his Democratic colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P5'>In 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War by newly elected president Franklin Pierce. In that position, he advocated for greater westward expansion and railroad development. Davis also supported the annexation of Cuba, in part for its strategic value in protecting American interests in the Gulf of Mexico, but also as a potential new slave state. That effort failed, but Davis continued to advocate for additional slave states in the west, particularly in 1854 with his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which struck down the Missouri Compromise’s limitation of slavery in the northern half of the federal territories. With President Pierce’s presidential term ending, Davis again ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was absent from his duties in the Capitol for several months due to recurring health problems, but continued to influence southern politics through letters and speeches in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P6'>When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Davis cautioned against extreme action by southern secessionists. He was still in Washington, D.C., when Mississippi formally declared its separation from the Union in January 1861, and he resigned his seat and gave a farewell address lamenting the sadness of the situation. Less than a month later, a Confederate constitutional convention in Alabama unanimously elected Davis as president of the Confederate States of America due to his military and political experience, and his steadfast defense of slavery. Additionally, many Confederate delegates believed Davis’s reputation as a moderate, compared to the more extreme secessionists, would appeal to southerners who had not yet embraced disunion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P7'>Davis was selection as president was widely hailed during the first months of the Confederacy. However, his popularity declined as the Civil War progressed, in part due to the unavoidable hardships that the south faced while carrying out a war against a larger and better equipped Union military, and because of the strong states rights sentiment within the south that denounced federal authority—even when it was the Confederate national government. Davis also proved to be less skilled than his Union counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, in resolving personal disputes and handling prickly political and military officials. He was loyal to friends or those he admired, assigning them key positions even when their performances were questionable, and he was accused of rejecting promotions or appointments for individuals he disliked.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P8'>In March 1865, when Union forces broke through Confederate lines outside of the Confederacy’s capital of Richmond, Virginia, Davis fled southward. He remained on the run over the next few weeks, desperately trying to maintain a war effort while Confederate armies were crumbling under the weight of federal military forces. In early May 1865, after Robert E. Lee and most other Confederates had surrendered, Davis dissolved the Confederate government. He tried to flee westward toward Texas, where the last Confederate troops held out, but he was captured on May 10, 1865, in Georgia. Federal authorities imprisoned Davis in Fort Monroe, Virginia, for two years. The U.S. government released him in 1867, having never formally tried him, but after President Andrew Johnson had already paroled other Confederate officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63185P9'>Davis and his family traveled to Europe shortly after his release, but eventually returned to the United States and settled down in a large manor along Mississippi’s southern coast. Despite some offers to return to the U.S. Senate, Davis did not hold political office again. He was legally disqualified since he had never received—nor asked for—an official pardon. Instead, Davis remained retired, writing a book about the Civil War. He passed away in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 6, 1889. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52436P0'>Charles Clark served as Mississippi’s governor during the last two years of the Civil War. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, Clark later moved to Mississippi, where he became a lawyer and a state representative in the late 1830s. After successfully representing a Mississippi settler in a land dispute with members of the Choctaw Nation in the early 1840s, Clark received a large tract of land near Beulah, Mississippi, as payment. Clark eventually enlarged his property to over five thousand acres, making it one of the largest and most successful plantations in Mississippi. During this time, he married Ann Eliza Darden and between 1840 and 1852 fathered three children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P1'>Clark volunteered for military service during the Mexican-American War in 1846 and raised a company of volunteers that was placed into the 2nd Mississippi Regiment. After its original commander resigned, Clark was elected colonel. Following the war in 1848, he returned to Mississippi resumed an interest in politics. He was selected as a delegate to a state convention in 1851 that debated the matter of secession in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, which had tried to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. Clark attended the convention as a Unionist, opposed to withdrawing from the Union. Developments over the next ten years changed his mind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P2'>Clark won a seat in the Mississippi’s House of Representatives as a Whig, serving from 1856 to 1861. Following Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in 1860, Clark embraced Mississippi’s secession. When the Civil War broke out, Clark received a commission as a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia. He later entered the Confederate Army and eventually took command of a division. Slightly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, he was more seriously wounded and captured during fighting at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August 1862. Clark spent a short time as a prisoner of war before he was paroled by Union forces.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P3'>In 1863, Clark ran for governor of Mississippi, in the wake of Confederate defeats at Vicksburg and Jackson. Clark campaigned on continued resistance to the Union and easily won the executive seat. Due to Union campaigns in Mississippi, Clark periodically moved the state government, from Jackson to Macon, then to Columbus, and back to Macon. When Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered in May 1865, Clark instructed the state legislature to convene for a special session in Jackson. In June 1865, federal troops at Jackson arrested Clark and imprisoned him at Fort Pulaski, Georgia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52436P4'>Eventually released from federal custody, Clark returned to Bolivar County, Mississippi. He quietly practiced law and served on the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during Reconstruction. In 1876, Clark received an appointment as chancellor for the fourth judicial district. He died a year later, on December 17, 1877. Clark is buried in a family cemetery at Beulah, Mississippi.
