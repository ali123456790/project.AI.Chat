                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32030164P0'>Thomas John Wood was a Union general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P1'>Born on September 25, 1823, in Munfordville, Kentucky, Wood graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1845. He briefly served as a staff officer to General Zachary Taylor during the Mexican-American War before requesting a combat assignment with the U.S. Second Dragoons (a cavalry unit) and serving with distinction at the Battle of Buena Vista in 1847. After the conflict with Mexico ended, Wood remained in service with the U.S. cavalry, serving at various outposts in the west. In 1859 he took a leave of absence from the army and traveled to Europe, returning in 1861 during the secession crisis and outbreak of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P2'>Back in the United States in 1861, Wood helped raise several regiments in Indiana. He received a promotion in the Union army to brigadier general in October 1861, and commanded a brigade during Union campaigns in Tennessee and Mississippi. He later received command of a division, leading troops at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and at the Battle of Murfreesboro, from December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863. During the Battle of Chickamauga in Georgia in September 1863, Wood received a surprising tactical order from the Union commander, General William S. Rosecrans, which instructed him to move his division out of position. The maneuver, which was based upon Rosecrans’ confusion of troop positions, would create a large gap in the Union line. Having been criticized by Rosecrans before for not immediately obeying directives, Wood followed the order exactly as written. A short time later, Confederate soldiers flooded into the hole left by Wood’s division and split the Union army, contributing to the federal defeat in the battle. Wood was among those blamed for the loss at Chickamauga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P3'>Wood performed very well in subsequent battles, including Missionary Ridge in Tennessee in November 1863 and at Lovejoy’s Station in Georgia in August 1864, helping him earn higher command. Despite a severe wound to the leg at Lovejoy’s Station, Wood returned to the field only weeks later and led an army corps during the Battle of Nashville in December 1864 and received promotion to major general in early 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P4'>Following the Civil War, Wood received orders to Mississippi for occupation duties. He served there until 1868, overseeing various Reconstruction activities, then retired from the army and moved to Dayton, Ohio.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P5'>Wood died on February 26, 1906, in Dayton. He had been married to Caroline Elizabeth Greer since 1861, and had three children. Wood is buried in the United States Military Academy Post Cemetery at West Point, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS57093P0'>Oliver Otis Howard was a Union general during the Civil War who led the Freedmen’s Bureau during the Reconstruction era and was a founder of Howard University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P1'>Born on November 8, 1830, in Leeds, Maine, Howard was educated at several schools and academies, including Bowdoin College, before graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1854. He was commissioned a lieutenant and ordnance officer in the U.S. Army, serving at various arsenals in the 1850s. In 1857, Howard participated in the Seminole Wars in Florida. During his service there, he became an evangelical Christian and his religious faith became a defining characteristic for the rest of his life. Although he considered transitioning to a career in the ministry, Howard remained in the army and served as an instructor in mathematics at West Point during the late 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Howard became colonel of the Third Maine Infantry Regiment. During the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, he commanded a brigade of Union soldiers. He performed well enough that the War Department promoted him to brigadier general and continued to command the brigade during the Union’s efforts to capture Richmond during the spring and summer of 1862. Howard played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Fair Oaks on June 1, 1862. During the engagement he sustained two serious wounds to his right arm. Army surgeons amputated the arm and he recovered quickly. More than thirty years later—in 1893—Howard received the Medal of Honor for his actions at Fair Oaks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P3'>By November 1862, Howard was back in the field with a promotion to major general and given command of the XI Corps of the Army of the Potomac. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, his corps was badly beaten by a surprise Confederate flank attack. He faced criticism that he had not properly protected his right flank, and that the collapse of his corps had directly led to the overall Union army’s defeat at the battle.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P4'>Howard faced additional criticism after the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, when his corps was overwhelmed by Confederate troops on the first day of fighting and he then argued with Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, a very popular and successful battlefield commander, over seniority. His corps fought well at Cemetery Hill on the second and third days of the battle, but Howard’s reputation in the Army of the Potomac was strained if not ruined by questionable performances in two major battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P5'>Following Gettysburg, Union officials transferred Howard and his XI Corps to Tennessee, where it joined with Major General Henry Slocum’s XII Corps to form the Army of the Cumberland. He and his corps had greater success in the western theater, taking part in a victorious assault against Confederate troops at Chattanooga and generally performing well as part of William Tecumseh Sherman’s advance on Atlanta, Georgia, in the summer of 1864. In the fall of 1864, Sherman gave Howard command of the Army of the Tennessee, passing over the more senior John A. Logan. Sherman’s decision was reportedly due to the fact that Howard was a West Point graduate, while Logan was not.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P6'>Immediately following the Civil War, Howard was made commissioner of the Army’s Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands—popularly known as the Freedmen’s Bureau—which had martial authority over many aspects of Reconstruction in the former Confederacy. He helped establish schools for freed people, improved medical services to the poor and displaced, and oversaw the distribution of provisions to impoverished areas of the postwar south. Howard and the Freedmen’s Bureau also had authority to redistribute property and prosecute individuals accused of violating Reconstruction policies. Howard ran into opposition from President Andrew Johnson, who was less sympathetic to the plight of African Americans and objected to the bureau’s broad powers. However, Howard was backed by powerful Radical Republicans in Congress through his tenure over the Freedmen’s Bureau.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P7'>In 1866, while commissioner of the bureau, Howard also helped establish a university for African American preachers in Washington, D.C. Originally named the Howard Normal and Theological Institute for the Dducation of Preachers and Teachers, the school was renamed simply Howard University in 1867.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P8'>Howard transferred to the American west in 1872, handling Native American relations for the next several years. He oversaw various military campaigns to relocate Indian tribes, such as the Nez Perce, in the northwest. In 1881, he took a new assignment as superintendent of West Point, but stayed only a year before rotating through a series of departmental commands across the United States. He retired in 1894 as a major general in the Regular U.S. Army. Howard died on October 26, 1909, at the age of 78. He was married to Elizabeth Waite and had at least seven children. He is buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington, Vermont.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32030249P0'>Manning Ferguson Force was a general in the Union Army during the Civil War and received the Medal of Honor for bravery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030249P1'>Born on December 17, 1824, in Washington, D.C., Force was the son of the D.C. mayor. He received an offer to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, but turned it down to attend Harvard College. He received a degree from that institution in 1845 and then graduated from Harvard Law School in 1848. Force then moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and began practicing law. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Force volunteered for the Union army and served as an officer in the Twentieth Ohio Infantry Regiment. He saw combat in the western theater, including the Vicksburg campaign in Mississippi and then William Tecumseh Sherman’s campaign for Atlanta. On July 22, 1864, during fighting outside of Atlanta, Force led Union troops in an assault upon a Confederate position and was seriously wounded in the face. He recovered, and participated in Sherman’s march across Georgia and into the Carolinas. Force proved to be a very capable officer, receiving several promotions, including a brevet (honorary) promotion to major general by the end of the war.

<p xml:id='OTPS32030249P2'>Following the Civil War, Force initially served occupation duty in Mississippi. He eventually left the army and returned to the legal profession in Cincinnati. He was placed upon the Superior Court of Cincinnati and became a noted scholar, writing and lecturing extensively on legal topics. In 1892, Force was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on July 22, 1864, at Atlanta—twenty-eight years after that battle and his serious wound.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32031770P0'>The United States government assumed military control over the former Confederacy and divided states like Mississippi into five military districts in 1867. The states then underwent the process of formally re-entering or regaining full status in the U. S. The first step of that process was the passage and ratification of a new state constitution reflecting the 13th and 14th amendments to the United States Constitution, thereby abolishing slavery and granting African-American men the franchise. Mississippi voters, Black and white, voted by referendum in 1867 to hold a constitutional convention. From January to May 1868, the convention met in Jackson, Mississippi. Composed of African American and white Unionist delegates, the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1868 featured the same high level of tension and acrimonious debate as other Reconstruction-era conventions. The convention prohibited participation by ex-Confederates and consequently excluded many Democrats, who sharply criticized what they dubbed the "Black and tan convention" due to the delegates' race. The convention produced the most progressive constitution in the state's history, abolishing slavery, extending civil rights to all people including African Americans and women, apportioning the number legislative seats based on population, barring ex-Confederates from public office, and establishing free public schools. However, the Constitution of 1868 faced widespread opposition and was voted against by Mississippians in the only popular vote for constitutional ratification in the state's history. At President Ulysses S. Grant's insistence, the Constitution was voted on again later that same year, article-by-article rather than in its entirety. The state passed all but the provision barring ex-Confederates from office, paving the way for Mississippi's re-entry into the Union in 1870 (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
