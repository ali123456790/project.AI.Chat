                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
