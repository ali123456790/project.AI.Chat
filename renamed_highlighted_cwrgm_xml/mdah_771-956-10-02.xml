                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS57093P0'>Oliver Otis Howard was a Union general during the Civil War who led the Freedmen’s Bureau during the Reconstruction era and was a founder of Howard University.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P1'>Born on November 8, 1830, in Leeds, Maine, Howard was educated at several schools and academies, including Bowdoin College, before graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1854. He was commissioned a lieutenant and ordnance officer in the U.S. Army, serving at various arsenals in the 1850s. In 1857, Howard participated in the Seminole Wars in Florida. During his service there, he became an evangelical Christian and his religious faith became a defining characteristic for the rest of his life. Although he considered transitioning to a career in the ministry, Howard remained in the army and served as an instructor in mathematics at West Point during the late 1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Howard became colonel of the Third Maine Infantry Regiment. During the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, he commanded a brigade of Union soldiers. He performed well enough that the War Department promoted him to brigadier general and continued to command the brigade during the Union’s efforts to capture Richmond during the spring and summer of 1862. Howard played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Fair Oaks on June 1, 1862. During the engagement he sustained two serious wounds to his right arm. Army surgeons amputated the arm and he recovered quickly. More than thirty years later—in 1893—Howard received the Medal of Honor for his actions at Fair Oaks.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P3'>By November 1862, Howard was back in the field with a promotion to major general and given command of the XI Corps of the Army of the Potomac. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, his corps was badly beaten by a surprise Confederate flank attack. He faced criticism that he had not properly protected his right flank, and that the collapse of his corps had directly led to the overall Union army’s defeat at the battle.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P4'>Howard faced additional criticism after the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, when his corps was overwhelmed by Confederate troops on the first day of fighting and he then argued with Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, a very popular and successful battlefield commander, over seniority. His corps fought well at Cemetery Hill on the second and third days of the battle, but Howard’s reputation in the Army of the Potomac was strained if not ruined by questionable performances in two major battles.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P5'>Following Gettysburg, Union officials transferred Howard and his XI Corps to Tennessee, where it joined with Major General Henry Slocum’s XII Corps to form the Army of the Cumberland. He and his corps had greater success in the western theater, taking part in a victorious assault against Confederate troops at Chattanooga and generally performing well as part of William Tecumseh Sherman’s advance on Atlanta, Georgia, in the summer of 1864. In the fall of 1864, Sherman gave Howard command of the Army of the Tennessee, passing over the more senior John A. Logan. Sherman’s decision was reportedly due to the fact that Howard was a West Point graduate, while Logan was not.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P6'>Immediately following the Civil War, Howard was made commissioner of the Army’s Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands—popularly known as the Freedmen’s Bureau—which had martial authority over many aspects of Reconstruction in the former Confederacy. He helped establish schools for freed people, improved medical services to the poor and displaced, and oversaw the distribution of provisions to impoverished areas of the postwar south. Howard and the Freedmen’s Bureau also had authority to redistribute property and prosecute individuals accused of violating Reconstruction policies. Howard ran into opposition from President Andrew Johnson, who was less sympathetic to the plight of African Americans and objected to the bureau’s broad powers. However, Howard was backed by powerful Radical Republicans in Congress through his tenure over the Freedmen’s Bureau.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P7'>In 1866, while commissioner of the bureau, Howard also helped establish a university for African American preachers in Washington, D.C. Originally named the Howard Normal and Theological Institute for the Dducation of Preachers and Teachers, the school was renamed simply Howard University in 1867.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57093P8'>Howard transferred to the American west in 1872, handling Native American relations for the next several years. He oversaw various military campaigns to relocate Indian tribes, such as the Nez Perce, in the northwest. In 1881, he took a new assignment as superintendent of West Point, but stayed only a year before rotating through a series of departmental commands across the United States. He retired in 1894 as a major general in the Regular U.S. Army. Howard died on October 26, 1909, at the age of 78. He was married to Elizabeth Waite and had at least seven children. He is buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington, Vermont.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52495P0'>Samuel Russell Thomas was a Union officer during the Civil War and a Freedmen’s Bureau official in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P1'>Born on April 27, 1840, in South Point, Ohio, Thomas worked for the Keystone Iron Company as a young man and initially studied mining. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Union military service, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Twenty-seventh Ohio Infantry Regiment. He was repeatedly promoted, eventually reaching the rank of colonel and then the brevet (honorary) rank of general. Thomas participated in several battles in the western theater, including Shiloh, Vicksburg, and Chattanooga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P2'>At the end of the Civil War, Thomas initially remained in the army, serving as a staff officer under General Oliver O. Howard, who was commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandon Lands (or Freedmen’s Bureau). Thomas oversaw much of the bureau’s work in Mississippi during the first two years after the war. He mustered out of the army in early 1867 and returned to Ohio, where he found success in industrial development, including the manufacturing of pig iron, mining coal, and then constructing railroads. He served as an executive in several railroad companies during the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P3'>Thomas died on January 11, 1903. He was married to Ann Porter and had three children. He is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)
