                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS55687P0'>Commonly known as the Father of the United States, George Washington was an American Founding Father, Commander of the Continental Army, and the first U.S. President.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P1'>During the Civil War, both the U.S. and the Confederacy claimed that they were preserving the ideals of the Founding Fathers, particularly George Washington. Confederates even used his image on the Great Seal of the Confederacy and on an official postage stamp, claiming that they were protecting his legacy from a radicalized north. Thomas R. R. Cobb of the Georgia delegation to the Montgomery Convention also suggested naming the new nation the “Republic of Washington,” and others claimed that they were fighting a “Second American Revolution” with Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee often celebrated as “second Washingtons.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P2'>Born on February 22, 1732 at Pope’s Creek in Westmoreland in the British colony of Virginia, George Washington became a land surveyor, receiving a surveyor’s license from the College of William &amp; Mary in 1749. He served as the surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia for one year. Washington was also a major and commander of one of Virginia’s four militia districts. This role included negotiating peace with the Iroquois Confederacy, and he was given the nickname Conotocaurius by the leader of the Iroquois.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P3'>In 1754, Washington unwittingly took responsibility for the Jumonville affair, where Washington’s men, which included Indian allies, ambushed a French detachment of around fifty men, killing the French, including their commander Joseph Coulon de Jumonviille, who was scalped. This was a key. moment in igniting the French and Indian War. Washington continued to serve in the war, commanding the Virginia Regiment as a colonel from August 1755 until his resignation in 1758. This included defending 300 miles of frontier and the expansion of his regiment from 300 to 1,000 men, which developed his skills as a leader and taught him British military tactics that would serve him many years later.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P4'>After the war, Washington returned to his Mount Vernon estate, where he married the widow Martha Dandridge Custis. By 1775, he doubled the size of his estate to 6,500 acres and was the enslaver of more than one hundred men, women, and children. He also became involved in local politics, including representing Frederick County in the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1758 to 1775. Washington was a prominent critic of British taxation and a proponent of boycotting British goods throughout this period.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P5'>During the Revolution, he was a delegate to both the First and Second Continental Congresses, and on June 15, 1775, he was unanimously elected commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Washington held the army together through incredibly difficult circumstances including a winter at Valley Forge that cost the lives of between 2,000 and 3,000 men due to lack of food, clothing, and shelter. Initially, Washington also banned the enlistment of Black soldiers, but he overturned this decision, ensuring that one-tenth of the soldiers in the Continental Army were Black by the end of the war. The war ended with Washington’s victory over the British at the siege of Yorktown in October 1781.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P6'>After the American Revolutionary War, Washington delivered his farewell address to the Army on November 2, 1783 and resigned as commander-in-chief. He returned to Mount Vernon, where he sought to turn the tide of the estate’s eleven-year-deficit run. Politically, Washington was also an advocate of a strong centralized government and expressed significant concerns over the Articles of Confederation. He attended the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, was unanimously elected to preside over the meeting, and lobbied many delegates to support the ratification of the Constitution.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P7'>Washington was unanimously elected first President of the United States on February 4, 1789. As the nation’s first president, he played a crucial role in defining the office of the presidency and in establishing its precedents. This included the inaugural address, messages to Congress, the role of the Cabinet, and the presidential tradition of retiring after two terms. After his Presidency, Washington returned to Mount Vernon, where he expressed his growing disillusionment over the institution of slavery and ultimately emancipated up to 124 enslaved people. He remained a committed Federalist and served as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army from July 1798 (during the Quasi-War with the French) until his death, although he did not assume a field command. He also served as chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary from 1788 until his death in 1799.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS55687P8'>George Washington was married to Martha (Dandridge Custis) Washington, the widow of Daniel Parke Custis (married 1750 to 1757). George Washington did not have any children of his own but helped raise Martha’s son and daughter John Parke “Jacky” Custis and Martha Parke “Patsy” Custis. Washington died on December 14, 1799 in his home at Mount Vernon. He was buried in the Washington family vault at Mount Vernon, Fairfax County, Virginia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009935P0'>After the War for American Independence, the United States faced mounting economic and social pressures. The nation's first governing document, the Articles of Confederation, created a weak central government incapable of raising enough funds to cover its debts. Every state except Rhode Island sent delegates, 74 total (only 55 of whom participated in the proceedings), to a convention held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from May 25 to September 17, 1787.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009935P1'>The delegates, led by presiding officer George Washington, initially intended to amend the Articles of Confederation to strengthen the federal government. However, after debate, the delegates soon saw the utility of abandoning the Articles and crafting a new form of government entirely. One of the main points of disagreement became the debate between large states (led by Virginia) and small states (led by New Jersey) over whether to apportion representatives based on size or to give each state equal representatives. The delegates, led by those from Connecticut, compromised on a bicameral legislature with a Senate of equal apportionment and a House of Representatives based on population. The delegates also divided the government into judiciary, legislative, and executive branches with the President at the locus of political power. This new government lent more power to the federal government, particularly in taxation and trade, to remedy the ills of the Articles of Confederation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009935P2'>Another key issue dividing delegates was enslavement. The convention, composed exclusively of elite white males, many of whom owned enslaved persons, sharply disagreed about the role of slavery in a new republic touting the equality of all men. Both northern and southern delegates frequently threatened to leave over the issue, so the delegates dealt with slavery only by prolonging the issue to a later date. The convention prohibited complete abolition before 1808 and created a fugitive slave clause to ensure that all states, free or not, were required to return self-emancipated enslaved persons to their enslavers. Ultimately, the delegates produced the United States Constitution, which was ratified by the required 9 out of 13 state legislatures in 1788 and remains the principle governing document of the United States today (Britannica)

It is comprised of the Senate and the House of Representatives, both of whom are responsible for creating and passing bills and convene at the State's Capitol located in Washington, D.C. Members can be elected to serve repeatedly and must be at least twenty-five years of age for the House of Representatives and at least thirty for the Senate. They must also reside in the state in which they represent and have United States Citizenship for at least seven years for the House of Representatives or nine years for the Senate. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD49524P0'>The National Union Party was a political rebranding by many Republicans during the 1864 presidential campaign in response to divisions within overall Republican Party. Some Radical Republicans, upset with President Abraham Lincoln’s moderate approach to war and abolition, broke away to form the Radical Democratic Party to nominate their own candidate for the presidential election. Worried that the fracture would deny Lincoln the political support for reelection, mainline Republicans adopted the name National Union Party and declared its goal to be the unconditional surrender of the Confederacy to attract fiercely anti-secession Democrats opposed to their own party’s lean toward peace with the Confederacy. Additionally, the National Union Party nominated Democrat Andrew Johnson for Lincoln’s vice president. These steps allowed the pro-war Democrats to vote for a political ticket that was not specifically Republican in name or candidates. The National Union Party platform still incorporated some Republican objectives, including support for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery and praise for the use of African American soldiers in the Union army. Lincoln and the National Union Party won the election of 1864, in large part due to Union battlefield victories that boosted confidence in the war effort that summer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD49524P1'>Upon Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865, Andrew Johnson became president. Though nominally the head of the National Union Party, Johnson soon found himself without much organized support. The party had been created to bolster Lincoln’s reelection and the defeat the Confederacy, both of which had been accomplished when Johnson entered the White House. He battled Radical Republicans over Reconstruction policies, which led to his accusations of him being too lenient on the former Confederacy. As Johnson’s reputation soured, many people abandoned the National Union Party. By 1867, the party was a shell of its former self, with many members being southern Unionists like Johnson. When Johnson left the presidency in 1869, with the inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant as a Republican president, the National Union Party officially ended. (Wikipedia)

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
