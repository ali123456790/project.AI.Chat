                    <p xml:id='OTPS32021942P0'>Joseph Plummer Schooley was a Union officer during the Civil War and early part of Reconstruction in the South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021942P1'>Born on August 29, 1832, in Manchester, Indiana, Schooley moved to Illinois with his young wife, Ellen Bliven Clarke, in the 1850s. He volunteered for Union military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861 and enlisted in the Seventy-sixth Illinois Infantry Regiment. He reached the rank of sergeant major before resigning from that regiment in 1864 to be commissioned as an officer in the Fourth Mississippi Infantry Regiment (African Descent)—a regiment comprising primarily of former slaves, commanded by white officers. The regiment was renamed the Sixty-sixth United States Colored Troops in March 1864. Schooley held the rank of captain in the unit when the war ended in 1865. He remained with the regiment during its occupation duty in Mississippi for several months after the war. Schooley separated from the Union army around 1866 and returned to his family in Illinois and moved to Missouri.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021942P2'>His first wife passed away in September 1871, and Schooley married Mary Etta White that in December same year. He had a total of twelve children from the two marriages. Schooley died on December 4, 1895, in Austin, Missouri. He is buried in the Austin town cemetery.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32039077P0'>Dating back to the commissary-general office in the American Revolutionary War, the Subsistence Department formally came into being by legislation in 1818. It was responsible for procuring, storing, and providing food for the United States Army. The department remained small during the early nineteenth century, except for a temporary expansion during the Mexican War. Then, in July 1861, the department was enlarged to support the rapidly growing Union Army during the Civil War. The commissary-general in charge of the department attained the rank of brigadier general, and, by the end of the war, consisted of over 550 personnel. The department downsized against following the Civil War, but retained its role as the chief supplier of foodstuffs to the U.S. Army. (United States Army Center of Military History)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
