                    <p xml:id='OTPS32021942P0'>Joseph Plummer Schooley was a Union officer during the Civil War and early part of Reconstruction in the South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021942P1'>Born on August 29, 1832, in Manchester, Indiana, Schooley moved to Illinois with his young wife, Ellen Bliven Clarke, in the 1850s. He volunteered for Union military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861 and enlisted in the Seventy-sixth Illinois Infantry Regiment. He reached the rank of sergeant major before resigning from that regiment in 1864 to be commissioned as an officer in the Fourth Mississippi Infantry Regiment (African Descent)—a regiment comprising primarily of former slaves, commanded by white officers. The regiment was renamed the Sixty-sixth United States Colored Troops in March 1864. Schooley held the rank of captain in the unit when the war ended in 1865. He remained with the regiment during its occupation duty in Mississippi for several months after the war. Schooley separated from the Union army around 1866 and returned to his family in Illinois and moved to Missouri.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021942P2'>His first wife passed away in September 1871, and Schooley married Mary Etta White that in December same year. He had a total of twelve children from the two marriages. Schooley died on December 4, 1895, in Austin, Missouri. He is buried in the Austin town cemetery.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027385P0'>Orlando Charles Risdon was a Union officer who commanded African American troops in Mississippi during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027385P1'>Born on May 8, 1840, in Warrensville, Ohio, Risdon became a carpenter and wagon manufacturer as a young man. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Union military service. He served as a private in the Nineteenth Ohio Infantry for three months that summer, and then joined the Forty-Second Ohio Infantry in October 1861 with the rank of first lieutenant. Risdon saw combat in Virginia, Kentucky, and Mississippi, before participating the Vicksburg campaign in Mississippi in 1863. He was wounded in the head and hip during fighting at Vicksburg in May 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027385P2'>Union officials began recruiting African Americans for military service in federally-occupied portions of the south in early 1863, and Risdon accepted a commission as lieutenant colonel in the Third Mississippi Volunteers (African Descent). The regiment conducted garrison duty at Milliken’s Ben and Goodrich’s Landing in Louisiana until early 1864. In March 1864, the regiment was redesignated the Fifty-Third United States Colored Troops. When its original commander, Colonel Richard H. Ballinger, resigned, Risdon took command of the regiment and received a promotion to colonel. He led the unit through several scouting missions and skirmishes in Mississippi and Arkansas in 1864, returning to garrison duty at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in February 1865 and remaining there until the end of the war. By the end of the war, Risdon was a brevet (honorary) brigadier general for bravery during his military service. He remained in Mississippi until January 1866, participating in Reconstruction occupation duty and serving as paymaster of the Southwestern Division.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027385P3'>After separating from the army, Risdon returned to Ohio and took up a partnership producing cheese. Then, in 1873, he became sheriff of Portage County, and earned a reputation for integrity. After serving two terms as sheriff, Risdon purchased part of a grocery business and eventually established a successful company known as Risdon &amp; Taylor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027385P4'>Risdon died on November 30, 1894, reportedly of apoplexy (stroke or cerebral hemorrhage) and heart failure. He was 54 years old. Risdon was married to Nettie Crane and had two daughters. He is buried in Maple Grove. Cemetery in Ravenna, Ohio.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD76355P0'>The United States Department of War (or War Department) was the office responsible for managing the United States Army during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its origins date back to the creation of the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776 within the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. The office was refined in 1777 as the Board of War, separating it from the Congress, and then formed into the Department of War by the Congress of the Confederation. Initially the office had oversight over all aspects of military defense and war. However, during George Washington’s administration, the United States Congress created the Navy Department to handle maritime affairs, leaving the War Department in charge of the country’s ground forces. The department was led by the Secretary of War, a member of the president’s cabinet. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the department periodically expanded with the creation of sub-departments, later refined into bureaus, in response to international crises and increased military operations against Native Americans. This included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created in 1824. Congress transferred that office to the new Department of the Interior in 1849.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD76355P1'>During the American Civil War, the War Department took responsibility for the rapid growth and development of the Union army. Over the course of the war, department officials oversaw recruitment, training, supply, medical care, transportation, and pay for more than two million soldiers. During the latter half of the war, the War Department oversaw the administration of federal resources for freed slaves that sought refuge within Union lines with the creation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. Officials from that bureau continued to support and advocate for Black southerners, while other elements of the department managed the military governing of the former Confederate states, until the end of Reconstruction in 1877.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32039077P0'>Dating back to the commissary-general office in the American Revolutionary War, the Subsistence Department formally came into being by legislation in 1818. It was responsible for procuring, storing, and providing food for the United States Army. The department remained small during the early nineteenth century, except for a temporary expansion during the Mexican War. Then, in July 1861, the department was enlarged to support the rapidly growing Union Army during the Civil War. The commissary-general in charge of the department attained the rank of brigadier general, and, by the end of the war, consisted of over 550 personnel. The department downsized against following the Civil War, but retained its role as the chief supplier of foodstuffs to the U.S. Army. (United States Army Center of Military History)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
