                    <p xml:id='OTPS32028021P0'>Henry Warner Slocum was a Union general during the Civil War and a U.S. congressman from New York.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P1'>Born on September 24, 1827, in Delphi Falls, New York, he proved an intelligent and studious individual, earning a teaching certificate at the age of 16. After teaching for a few years, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1852. Slocum served for four years in the U.S. Army, participating in the Third Seminole War in Florida before resigning his commission in 1856 and moving to Syracuse, New York. He studied law for two years, and then was admitted as a practicing attorney in Syracuse in 1858. Within a year, Slocum was elected county treasurer and then was elected to the New York State Assembly.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Slocum volunteered for Union military service. He received a commission as colonel in command of the Twenty-Seventh New York Infantry Regiment. He led that unit during the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, receiving a severe wound. When he recovered enough to return to field service, Slocum was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of a brigade in the Army of the Potomac. By May 1862, he was in command of a division and led it with distinction during the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond, Virginia, receiving high praise from Union officers. In July 1862, at the age of 34, he was promoted to major general. He continued to perform well in battle, playing a conspicuous role in the Battle of South Mountain in September 1862 and the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P3'>Slocum played a vital, but somewhat unappreciated, role at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. On July 2, when ordered to relocate his XII Corps south in response to a Confederate assault on the Union left flank, Slocum wisely recognized the risk such move would cause to the Union army’s right flank at Culp’s Hill. He ordered one of his brigades to remain in defense of that position, which likely saved the Union Army from defeat at Gettysburg when that brigade repelled a massive Confederate assault upon Culp’s Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P4'>In the fall of 1863, Slocum was transferred to the western theater. He initially received command of a division tasked with protecting the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. However, in the summer of 1864, he received command of the XVII Corps in Tennessee and the District of Vicksburg. General Ulysses S. Grant was so impressed with Slocum’s management of the Vicksburg district that he wished to keep him in that position and delayed Slocum’s reassignment to field command in Georgia. Eventually, though, Slocum joined William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union force during the campaign for Atlanta, taking command of the XX Corps. He effectively led the corps during the campaign, resulting in his troops being the first to march into Atlanta when the city surrendered in. September 1864. He was then placed in charge of Union occupation forces in Atlanta for more than two months, showing compassion and efficiency in his duties.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P5'>Slocum received command of the Army of Georgia and supported Sherman’s march across Georgia to Savannah. His army did not see any major engagements during that campaign, but did see intense action in the subsequent Carolinas Campaign. When the Civil War ended in 1865, Slocum was among the most successful and respected Union generals.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P6'>Shortly after hostilities ended, Slocum resigned from the army and turned to civilian life. He unsuccessfully ran for the Secretary of State position in New York, then began a law practice. In 1868, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat and served two terms. After practicing law in the 1870s he again won a congressional seat in 1882 and served a single term. During his time in public office and as an attorney, Slocum was active in promoting infrastructure development in New York, including the construction and expansion of street cars and bridges.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32028021P7'>Slocum died on April 14, 1894. He was married to Carolina A. Rice and had three children. Slocum is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027472P0'>Hugh McCulloch was a businessman, banker, and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P1'>Born in Kennebunk, Maine, on December 7, 1808, McCulloch was educated in New England before moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1833 to practice law. Shortly afterwards, in 1835, he began working at the Bank of Indiana, rising from cashier to manager of the Fort Wayne branch, then to president of the overall company. He remained at the bank until 1863, when he was appointed by Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase to be Comptroller of the Currency. McCulloch proved very capable in that role, recommending changes to banking laws and seeing widespread success among banks in the northern states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P2'>In March 1865, President Abraham Lincoln offered McCulloch the position of Secretary of the Treasury. He reluctantly accepted the job, and proved successful at reducing the national debt. He opposed the widespread use of paper currency and labored to reduce paper bills in circulation. The effort was not popular and was eventually halted by Congress. When his term as secretary ended in 1869, McCulloch moved to England and worked as a partner in the banking firm of Jay Cooke, McCulloch &amp; Co. McCulloch was called again to public service in 1884, when President Chester A. Arthur appointed him as Secretary of the Treasury. He served only six months, until March 1885, when Arthur’s presidential term ended.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027472P3'>McCulloch died on May 24, 1895. He had been married twice, first to Eunice Hardy who died in 1836, only two years after their wedding. He then married Susan Man in 1838 and had at least five children. McCulloch is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52495P0'>Samuel Russell Thomas was a Union officer during the Civil War and a Freedmen’s Bureau official in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P1'>Born on April 27, 1840, in South Point, Ohio, Thomas worked for the Keystone Iron Company as a young man and initially studied mining. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Union military service, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Twenty-seventh Ohio Infantry Regiment. He was repeatedly promoted, eventually reaching the rank of colonel and then the brevet (honorary) rank of general. Thomas participated in several battles in the western theater, including Shiloh, Vicksburg, and Chattanooga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P2'>At the end of the Civil War, Thomas initially remained in the army, serving as a staff officer under General Oliver O. Howard, who was commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandon Lands (or Freedmen’s Bureau). Thomas oversaw much of the bureau’s work in Mississippi during the first two years after the war. He mustered out of the army in early 1867 and returned to Ohio, where he found success in industrial development, including the manufacturing of pig iron, mining coal, and then constructing railroads. He served as an executive in several railroad companies during the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52495P3'>Thomas died on January 11, 1903. He was married to Ann Porter and had three children. He is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99399P0'>Plantations are farms that typically grow cash crops, and often specialize in a single product, such as cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane. Plantation farming continues in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century, especially for crops like coffee beans, rubber trees, and cocoa. In American history the term plantation is most often associated with estates in the American south. Historical descriptions of plantations generate images of large farming operations. However, even moderately-sized southern farms that planted cash crops were sometimes referred to as plantations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P1'>Southern plantations before the Civil War were strongly tied to the institution of slavery. As profit-driven agricultural operations, plantations required large numbers of laborers. This fed the demand for African slave importation to the British colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and bolstered the defense of slavery among southern planters in the nineteenth century. Plantation crops varied by region within the south, with rice being popular in Georgia and South Carolina along the Atlantic coast, tobacco being an early cash crop in Virginia, and then—after the invention of the cotton gin at the end of the eighteenth century which quickly separated seeds from the cotton fibers—the boom in cotton growing across the Deep South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P2'>By 1860, there were approximately 46,200 plantations across the south. More than 20,000 had twenty to thirty slaves. Only about 2,300, or five percent, had one hundred or more slaves. The enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work. The plantations were their home. The same was not always true for the plantation owners. The very large operations frequently had wealthy absentee owners, who resided in cities or other states, leaving plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers. Slave cabins, or slave quarters, were a ubiquitous part of a plantation. They represented the heart of the laborers’ community on the property, but were usually of basic construction and few amenities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P3'>Following the abolition of slavery after the Civil War, many freed people continued to live on plantations. Sharecropping became a popular arrangement between the landowners and the laborers. The property was often divided into plots with tenants assigned to certain sections. The system involved a contract or arrangement which allowed the laborer, or tenant, to keep a portion of the crop they raised. The system was abused, and developed a negative reputation for the level of poverty many sharecroppers (mostly Black, but some white) experienced on plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Representatives of the Freedmen’s Bureau sought to protect Black sharecroppers by regulating contracts during Reconstruction, but the withdrawal of federal officials after 1876 left many African American tenants more subject to unfair sharecropping contracts on the old plantations.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32082712P2'>By the mid-nineteenth century, Mississippi was the top cotton producing state in the Union. In 1860, it had around 37,000 farms. Almost 25,000 of them were plantations over one hundred acres in size, although only 481 were truly extravagant at over one thousand acres. Cotton production required farmers and planters to invest a great deal into labor and equipment, leading Mississippi to rank third among the slaveholding states for total value of farm machinery ($8.8 million in 1860, or $330 million today), slightly trailing Virginia ($9.4 million in 1860, or $355 million today) and well behind Louisiana ($18.6 million in 1860, or $702 million today).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32082712P3'>Although plantations were profit-driven operations, many in Mississippi were self-sufficient, with subsistence farm plots and livestock to feed the labor force. Enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work on plantations. The plantations were their home. The largest plantations were like small villages, with many different buildings, including the master’s house (usually large and extravagant), barns, workshops, storage facilities, and slave quarters. Some plantation owners lived part-time on the property, or visited only occasionally, residing most of the year in cities or other states. They left plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32126737P0'>On March 12, 1863, the U.S. Congress passed “An Act to provide for the Collection of abandoned Property and for the Prevention of Frauds in insurrectionary Districts within the United States.” The act authorized U.S. officials to take possession of private property which had no military value (like cotton or other agricultural resources) but had been abandoned or captured during Union military operations within the Confederacy. Such property had not been addressed by the earlier Confiscation Acts of 1861 and 1862, leaving it without clear legal ownership during the Civil War. Beyond answering that legal technicality, the act benefitted the Union war effort. Military forces could secure such property to reduce the Confederacy’s resources and add to the United States finances. The law directed the Secretary of the Treasury to appoint special agents for the collection of this non-military property in Confederate areas. The agents would then transfer the goods to a loyal state for sale, with the money raised sent to the Treasury Department. The law warned that any Union service member or U.S. official who failed to turn over confiscated property, such as cotton, sugar, rice, or tobacco from the Confederacy, could face legal punishment. This latter stipulation was intended to reduce fraud and corruption by individual speculators seeking to secure cash crops for personal gain. Finally, the act declared that any person claiming ownership of goods confiscated through this law could petition for restitution within two years after the suppression of the rebellion as long as they could demonstrate to a court that they had not given aid or comfort to the Confederacy.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32126740P0'>On July 2, 1864, the U.S. Congress passed legislation expanding the use of non-military private property captured by Union forces within the Confederacy. Officially titled, “An Act in addition to the several Acts concerning Commercial Intercourse between loyal and insurrectionary States, and to provide the Collection of captured and abandoned Property, and the Prevention of Frauds in States declared in Insurrection,” the law followed the 1863 Captured and Abandoned Property Act, which had authorized Union officials to transfer abandoned or captured non-military private goods (such as cotton, rice, and tobacco) from the Confederacy to loyal states for auction. The proceeds of such sales were sent to the United States Treasury. This 1864 act allowed U.S. officials to use captured or abandoned real estate within former Confederate areas controlled by Union forces, for up to twelve months, for the purpose of employing and housing formerly enslaved people within the Confederacy. Part of the new law addressed issues of corruption and dictated that the policies and restrictions of possessing and selling abandoned or captured non-military goods applied to all commercial intercourse and individuals, regardless of nationality or military status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32035127P0'>The United States Army Department of Mississippi was a geographical command established on November 28, 1864. It was headquartered in Vicksburg and encompassed the states of Mississippi and Tennessee west of the Tennessee River. On January 17, 1865 the areas of Mississippi occupied by forces under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas were detached to the Department of the Cumberland, followed by western Tennessee on February 10, 1865. On May 17, 1865 western Mississippi was detached to the Department of the Gulf and re-attached on June 27, 1865. It was discontinued on August 6, 1866, its territory merged into the Department of the Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63977P0'>The United States Navy, also known as the Union Navy during the American Civil War, was primarily responsible for blockading the Confederacy’s coastlines and harbors, destroying Confederate ships, and supporting Union Army amphibious operations along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shores, and river. At the beginning of the war, the Union Navy had ninety ships, far outmatching the Confederacy’s fourteen vessels. Through the North’s superior manufacturing capabilities and larger population, the Union Navy substantially increased its force to more than 650 ships and 20,000 sailors by the time the war ended. In comparison, the Confederate Navy barely surpassed one hundred ships and 5,000 sailors.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P1'>The Union Navy’s blockade of the Confederacy was very successful, cutting the South’s trade to only five percent of its pre-war numbers. In a vain effort to defeat the federal ships blocking their harbors, Confederate forces focused on innovative ship technology, such as ironclad vessels (wooden ships protected by iron plates) and the first operational submarine (named the Henley). Union officials managed to counter these efforts by developing their own ironclad ships, including the USS <I>Monitor</I>, a flat, iron-plated vessel with a rotating turret.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P2'>While the Union Navy did engage in a few notable sea battles (the fight between the USS <I>Monitor</I> and the Confederacy’s ironclad CSS <I>Virginia</I> being the most famous), most of its combat action involved supporting the Union Army’s ground operations along the Mississippi River, at Mobile Bay, and in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fort Fisher, North Carolina. Capturing ports and coastal fortifications not only reduced the strength of the Confederate military, but gave the Union Navy vital supply bases for its own operations around the South. The assaults upon the coastal positions involved more traditional naval warfare with cannonading by wooden ships; but the Navy developed the shallower draft ironclads for operations on the rivers and waterways. These steam-powered ships were more maneuverable than wooden sail ships, and were better protected against close-range artillery by Confederate river forts.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63977P3'>After the Civil War, the Union Navy—like the army—downsized to a number close to its pre-war number. However, the war had introduced key technological and doctrinal changes to sea and river warfare across the globe. At least for a short time, the Union Navy had been the most technologically advanced maritime force in the world. (Wikipedia; American Battlefield Trust)

The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
