                    <p xml:id='OTPS52215P0'>William Lewis Sharkey served as Mississippi’s governor in 1865, early in the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P1'>Born in Sumner County, Tennessee, on July 12, 1798, Sharkey moved with his family to Warren County, Mississippi, in 1804. As an adult, he studied law and began practicing in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1822. Sharkey moved to Vicksburg in 1825 and pursued political office. He won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives and served one term from 1828 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P2'>In 1832, Sharkey married Minerva Cage, a widow with two children. The couple had four children over the next several years.  In 1832, Sharkey also became a circuit court judge and was shortly thereafter elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals, the predecessor to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. He served in that role for 18 years, resigning in 1851. From there, he took a diplomatic appointment for the United States government, serving as U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba, until 1854. After completing that diplomatic assignment, Sharkey returned to Mississippi and returned to legal and political duties, helping compile the Mississippi Code of 1857.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P3'>During the secession crisis in the winter of 1860 and 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Sharkey remained a steadfast Unionist. Having been a member of the Whig Party, he retained his opposition to secession and refused to support the Confederacy, even as he remained in Mississippi through the Civil War. Despite his political stance against Mississippi’s secessionist government, Confederate officials left him alone out of respect of his past service to the state as a judge and legal scholar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P4'>After the Confederacy’s defeat, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey provisional governor of Mississippi in June 1865. In that role, he called forth a constitutional convention to meet Johnson’s goal of swiftly restoring former Confederate states to the Union. In October 1865, Benjamin Humphreys won election as Mississippi’s governor. Sharkey did not vacate the office, though, until December 1865, having served less than a year. Although no longer governor, Sharkey was selected by the Mississippi legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. Federal officials denied him a seat, and the rest of the Mississippi congressional delegation, following the Republican backlash to Mississippi’s Black Codes—a set of racially discriminatory laws passed by the Mississippi legislature in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52215P5'>Having been denied a U.S. Senate seat, Sharkey returned to practicing law, in Jackson, Mississippi. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1873, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS58554P0'>Peter Joseph Osterhaus was a Union general during the Civil War who served as chief of staff of the Military Division of West Mississippi, the command over Union forces in the Mississippi area at the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P1'>Born on January 4, 1823, in Koblenz, Prussia (modern-day Germany), Osterhaus attended a military academy in Berlin and became a Prussian army officer in the 1840s. He immigrated to the United States in the 1850s, following a series of revolutions in Prussia. After a short time in Illinois, Osterhaus settled to St. Louis, Missouri, which had a large German American population. Due to his experience and interest in military affairs, he took an active role training German American militia units in that city. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Osterhaus volunteered for Union service. He rose to the rank of major of the Second Missouri Infantry Battalion (Union) and fought at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek in August 1861 in Missouri. Over the next two years, he rose in rank, commanding the Twelfth Missouri Infantry Regiment, and then being placed in charge of a division under Brigadier Franz Sigel, another German American officer. Osterhaus performed well at the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, in March 1862, resulting in his promotion to brigadier general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P2'>Ostherhaus was hospitalized in late 1862 with malaria, he returned to the field in time to command Union soldiers during an assault on Fort Hindman, Arkansas, capturing the Confederate garrison there in January 1863. He then commanded a division of Ulysses S. Grant’s army during the Vicksburg Campaign, fighting at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge. He was wounded in the leg at the latter engagement. Following the campaign for Vicksburg, Osterhaus was sent to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he suffered a battlefield defeat at Ringgold Gap, Georgia, in November 1863, but maintained his reputation as a capable combat commander. In 1864, he was part of William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union successful advance to Atlanta and earned promotion to major general that summer. In March 1865, Osterhaus was appointed chief of staff of the Military Division of West Mississippi, under Major General Edward Canby. The staff assignment did not preclude him from being campaigning in the field, as he participated in battles around Mobile, Alabama, including Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley. He served a conspicuous role in the surrender of Confederate forces in the deep south, in particular being the highest ranking Union officer present when General Edmund Kirby Smith surrendered Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Theater.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P3'>Osterhaus remained in the U.S. Army assisting with early Reconstruction and occupation duties in Mississippi until January 1866. He then received an appointment as U.S. Consul at Lyons, France. In the 1870s, he moved to Germany and received his German citizenship in 1879. He retained his connections to the United States, periodically visiting to attend reunions of the Grand Army of the Republic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P4'>Osterhaus died in Germany on January 2, 1917. He had been married twice; first in 1846 to Matilda Born, who died in 1863, and then in 1864 to Amalie Anna Maria Born, who died in 1896. He had three children by his first wife, and one with his second wife. Osterhaus is buried in Koblenz, Germany.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99663P0'>The term "emancipation" describes "the act of freeing a person from another person's control" (Cambridge Dictionary). In the nineteenth-century United States, this term most often referred to an enslaved person's escape from their enslaver's control and legal ownership. Self-emancipation describes "the act of an enslaved person freeing him or herself from the bondage of slavery," by a variety of means legal and extralegal. (American Battlefield Trust)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P1'>Occurring throughout the nineteenth century, self-emancipation under the law took the form of an enslaved person purchasing their own freedom through wages made performing trades outside of their enslaver's property. This process most often occurred in urban areas, particularly those in coastal regions of the U.S., but state legal restrictions made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99663P2'>The most extreme and least common form of self-emancipation was suicide, which many enslaved people chose rather than remaining in bondage. The most frequent method of self-emancipation, especially during the American Civil War, was to escape from an enslaver's property and flee without their permission. Many notable abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman self-emancipated by running away. Running away signaled how self-emancipation caused legal emancipation for all the enslaved in the United States. During the Civil War, so many enslaved persons self-emancipated and fled to Union lines that the U.S. government had to craft a response. That response manifested first in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later in the 13th Amendment of 1865, which abolished slavery altogether. Self-emancipation became a primary way for enslaved African Americans in the antebellum U.S. to wield agency over their lives, and their efforts eventually succeeded in producing legislative emancipation from the top down.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
