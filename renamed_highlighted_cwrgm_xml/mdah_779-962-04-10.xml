                    <p xml:id='OTPS58554P0'>Peter Joseph Osterhaus was a Union general during the Civil War who served as chief of staff of the Military Division of West Mississippi, the command over Union forces in the Mississippi area at the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P1'>Born on January 4, 1823, in Koblenz, Prussia (modern-day Germany), Osterhaus attended a military academy in Berlin and became a Prussian army officer in the 1840s. He immigrated to the United States in the 1850s, following a series of revolutions in Prussia. After a short time in Illinois, Osterhaus settled to St. Louis, Missouri, which had a large German American population. Due to his experience and interest in military affairs, he took an active role training German American militia units in that city. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Osterhaus volunteered for Union service. He rose to the rank of major of the Second Missouri Infantry Battalion (Union) and fought at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek in August 1861 in Missouri. Over the next two years, he rose in rank, commanding the Twelfth Missouri Infantry Regiment, and then being placed in charge of a division under Brigadier Franz Sigel, another German American officer. Osterhaus performed well at the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, in March 1862, resulting in his promotion to brigadier general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P2'>Ostherhaus was hospitalized in late 1862 with malaria, he returned to the field in time to command Union soldiers during an assault on Fort Hindman, Arkansas, capturing the Confederate garrison there in January 1863. He then commanded a division of Ulysses S. Grant’s army during the Vicksburg Campaign, fighting at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge. He was wounded in the leg at the latter engagement. Following the campaign for Vicksburg, Osterhaus was sent to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he suffered a battlefield defeat at Ringgold Gap, Georgia, in November 1863, but maintained his reputation as a capable combat commander. In 1864, he was part of William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union successful advance to Atlanta and earned promotion to major general that summer. In March 1865, Osterhaus was appointed chief of staff of the Military Division of West Mississippi, under Major General Edward Canby. The staff assignment did not preclude him from being campaigning in the field, as he participated in battles around Mobile, Alabama, including Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley. He served a conspicuous role in the surrender of Confederate forces in the deep south, in particular being the highest ranking Union officer present when General Edmund Kirby Smith surrendered Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Theater.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P3'>Osterhaus remained in the U.S. Army assisting with early Reconstruction and occupation duties in Mississippi until January 1866. He then received an appointment as U.S. Consul at Lyons, France. In the 1870s, he moved to Germany and received his German citizenship in 1879. He retained his connections to the United States, periodically visiting to attend reunions of the Grand Army of the Republic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS58554P4'>Osterhaus died in Germany on January 2, 1917. He had been married twice; first in 1846 to Matilda Born, who died in 1863, and then in 1864 to Amalie Anna Maria Born, who died in 1896. He had three children by his first wife, and one with his second wife. Osterhaus is buried in Koblenz, Germany.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32035127P0'>The United States Army Department of Mississippi was a geographical command established on November 28, 1864. It was headquartered in Vicksburg and encompassed the states of Mississippi and Tennessee west of the Tennessee River. On January 17, 1865 the areas of Mississippi occupied by forces under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas were detached to the Department of the Cumberland, followed by western Tennessee on February 10, 1865. On May 17, 1865 western Mississippi was detached to the Department of the Gulf and re-attached on June 27, 1865. It was discontinued on August 6, 1866, its territory merged into the Department of the Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32035127P1'>Its commanders were Maj. Gen. Napoleon J. T. Dana (November 28, 1864–May 1, 1865), Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren (May 1–June 27, 1865), Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum (June 27–September 16, 1865), Maj. Gen. Peter J. Osterhaus (September 16–November 14, 1865), Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Wood (November 14, 1865–August 6, 1866).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32099655P0'>During the nineteenth century, Mississippi operated a sporadic hospital system, which was primarily focused on creating state institutions to provide mental health care for people imprisoned in the state's penitentiary in Jackson and the Mississippi State Hospital, which operated in Jackson from 1855 to 1926 when it was moved to Rankin County. Otherwise medical and mental health care was typically handled locally, especially for enslaved people on plantations.

Due to the rapid expansion of armies during the Civil War, the small number of existing army and navy medical facilities could not treat most sick, injured, or wounded soldiers. Additionally, during campaigns, armies moved great distances. Therefore, many military hospitals in Mississippi during the Civil War were temporary facilities established in churches, homes, or other buildings near encampments, battlefields, or other locations convenient to receive patients. Medical treatments during the era were fairly basic, and physicians needed little specialized equipment beyond what they brought with them. Therefore, any building that provided shelter from the elements and, preferably, easy access to water could be used as a hospital. During Reconstruction, United States military hospitals tended to be longer term facilities carefully selected by military officials to assist soldiers serving occupation duties in Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73473P0'>Clubs and secret societies have been common throughout American history. Clubs are often small, localized groups formed openly by people who wish to enjoy or promote a common interest or cause, such as sports, hobbies, or politics. However, clubs are often associated with recreational interests. Secret societies, on the other hand, are organizations that keep their purpose, members, and activities concealed from outsiders. Some hide their very existence from the public, while others keep only their inner workings masked to retain a feeling of exclusivity or mystery for their members. Truly secret societies often exist for political reasons, where members wish to advocate or influence events covertly. Such organizations are often viewed with suspicion, and many conspiracy theories involve accusations of secret societies manipulating events for a sinister agenda.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73473P1'>Clubs and secretive organizations were very popular during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Fraternal groups, such as the Freemasons and Odd Fellows, which were well-known but had secret rituals and exclusive membership, thrived. Many such groups professed dedication to morality and ethical living, or supported charitable cause. However, members were often drawn to those organizations for the social bonds and camaraderie. The popularity of these organizations frequently led to their expansion to other cities, states, or even countries. Due to limited methods of communication before the twentieth century, local chapters or lodges often remained fairly independent from each other. Additionally, regional interests or differences occasionally caused divisions within national or international clubs and societies. For instance, disputes about slavery in the nineteenth century caused a rift between British and American members of the Independent Order of Good Templars.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73473P2'>Clubs and secret societies continue to exist in the twenty-first century. Unlike earlier groups, though, many modern organizations exist primarily online and rely upon membership outside their local communities. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99805P0'>Freemasons, or Masons, are members of a fraternal organization movement dating back to the stonemasons of the fourteenth century. The Masons are secretive and the development of their practices and organizational structure since the 1400s is unclear, even within Masonic circles. Members belong to Masonic Lodges, many of which rose semi-independently, and involve rituals and passwords known only to members.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99805P1'>Masons from separate lodges in London established the first Grand Lodge in 1717 as an effort to codify and regulate elements of Freemasonry. Over the next several decades, Freemasonry became popular in England, leading to more involvement by wealthy and aristocratic individuals, and shifting Freemasonry away from its working class origins. The first Freemasons in North America established a lodge in Pennsylvania around 1731. New lodges emerged across the English colonies, and several prominent colonial figures, including George Washington, became Masons. Following American independent, separate Grand Lodges formed in each state. Despite some efforts to unite them under a single United States Grand Lodge, the state lodges remained nominally independent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99805P2'>While Freemasonry has some association with Enlightenment thinking and advocacy during the eighteenth century, Masons did not cohesively endorse any political ideas or social movements. This allowed Masons to help each other even when on opposing sides of military or political conflicts. During the Civil War, there were numerous instances in which soldiers, upon being attacked or captured by enemy forces, provided Masonic signals or statements and received protection from Masons on the other side.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99805P3'>The secretive nature and adoption of rituals led to some criticism of Masons. Some religious leaders accused Freemasonry of being associated with the occult, or saw it as a competitor for Christian teachings. Other critics feared that Masons conspired for power and used their secretive membership to influence governments behind the scenes. Nevertheless, Freemasonry continued to flourish and is still present in the twenty-first century. (Wikipedia; Michael A. Halleran, <hi rend='italic'>The Better Angels of our Nature: Freemasonry in the American Civil War</hi>, 78–86)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32034178P0'>The Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF) is a fraternal organization formed in the United States in 1819 as the American Odd Fellows. It was based upon an older Order of Odd Fellows from the eighteenth century in England and maintained ties with the British lodges until 1842, when a dispute over black membership prompted the American Odd Fellows to break away into the IOOF. Although the IOOF limited membership to whites, in 1851 it established an auxiliary group for women, called the Daughters of Rebekah.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32034178P1'>Although the group was non-political and had lodges in northern and southern states, the Civil War disrupted the IOOF. Membership decreased some lodges dissolved. However, the organization survived and grew significantly after the war. It even surpassed the Freemasons in size, in part due to its appeal among middle and lower class workers. By the late nineteenth century, the IOOF had lodges in every American state. The organization continues to exist in the twenty-first century and proclaims a commitment to ethic of reciprocity and charity. (Wikipedia)
