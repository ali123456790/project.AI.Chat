                    <p xml:id='OTPS63158P0'>Samuel J. Gholson was a U.S. representative, U.S. district judge, and Confederate general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P1'>Born in Richmond, Kentucky, on May 19, 1808, Gholson spent much of his boyhood in Alabama. He began practicing law in Russellville, Alabama, in 1829 and shortly afterwards opened a law office in Athens, Mississippi. In 1835, he won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives. The following year, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for Mississippi as a Democrat. He served until 1838, when his seat was declared vacant. In 1839, he received an appointment to a joint seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District and for the Southern District of Mississippi. Gholson served in that capacity until 1861, when Mississippi seceded. He had been a delegate to the state’s secession convention, following Abraham Lincoln’s electoral victory as president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P2'>Gholson volunteered for Confederate military service. Although enlisting as a private, due to his age and standing as a public official, he was quickly promoted, eventually rising to major general of Mississippi state troops in 1863. Gholson campaigned in the field during his military service, being present at the battles of Fort Donelson, Iuka, and Corinth in 1862. In 1864, he received a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate army and placed in command of cavalry troops. He was badly wounded in the arm and captured during the Battle of Egypt Station in December 1864. His injuries were so severe that Union officers reported him to be mortally wounded. In fact, Gholson survived the wound, but his arm had to be amputated.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63158P3'>Gholson was released by Union forces in May 1865, after the war had ended. He immediately returned to state politics, winning a seat in the legislature that year. He served as the speaker of the house from 1865 to 1866, and then agitated against Republican Reconstruction over the next several years. He won election to the state legislature one more time, in 1878. Gholson died in 1883 and is buried in Odd Fellows Rest Cemetery in Aberdeen, Mississippi. He had been married to Margraten Ann Ragsdale, but the couple had no surviving children.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25021472P0'>John Duncan was an attorney and public figure in Mississippi during the mid-nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25021472P1'>Born to Scottish immigrant parents in 1812 in New York, Duncan moved to Grenada, Mississippi, in the 1830s and worked in a dry goods store with a brother and brother-in-law. Through his successful business dealings, he became a plantation owner, and studied law to become an attorney. He married Lucy Howell in 1856 and three children. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Duncan helped raise a company of volunteers for Confederate service—nicknamed the Duncan Riflemen in honor of his financial support for the unit—which was placed into the Forty-Fifth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He also worked alongside the Confederate government, including President Jefferson Davis, to promote cotton sales to England, and was reportedly a potential candidate for ambassador to England.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25021472P2'>Duncan worked as a business manager for several plantations, and served on the University of the South’s board of directors. He died on February 7, 1872. Duncan’s wife and three children all preceded him in death, dying of disease in 1862 and 1863. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.
