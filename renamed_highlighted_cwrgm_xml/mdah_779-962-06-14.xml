                    <p xml:id='OTPS52439P0'>Andrew Johnson was vice president under Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and served as president, following Lincoln’s assassination, during the first three years of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P1'>Born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Johnson came from a poor family and was sent by his parents to apprentice in a tailor’s shop. Gaining a basic education from his coworkers and customers, Johnson eventually ran away from Raleigh before his apprenticeship obligation was completed and lived in Alabama and Tennessee. He established a successful tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, earning enough money to purchase property and improve his education. He also began purchasing slaves, ultimately owning ten enslaved people before the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P2'>Johnson became interested in politics in Tennessee and developed great skill as a stump speaker. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834 and then won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Initially a Whig, Johnson joined the Democratic Party and gained strong party support. He improved his political standing by serving in the Tennessee militia, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1840s, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving in that body until 1853, when he became governor of Tennessee. He served two terms and then successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P3'>During the secession crisis and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. He faced harsh criticism from other Tennesseans, and was the only member of a seceded state to stay in the Senate. He was unable to return home during Congressional recesses during the war. In 1862, when his term as senator ended, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of Tennessee. He accepted the position and the rank of brigadier general, but faced retribution from Confederates in Tennessee who confiscated his land and property. As the war progressed, Johnson increasingly supported Republican efforts against slavery, including the Emancipation Proclamation. <lb/>
During the 1864 presidential campaign, Lincoln selected Johnson as his vice presidential candidate to draw in southern Unionist and War Democrat support. They won the election, but Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, only a few weeks after the inauguration, leaving Johnson to assume the presidency. Taking the executive office in the final days of the Civil War, Johnson began to enact his vision of Reconstruction of the southern states. He advocated for a rapid restoration of the Union and offered amnesty to most former Confederates. Johnson made exceptions for higher ranking Confederate officials, and required them to personally petition for pardons. He was less supportive of former slaves, and began to draw criticism from Republicans. In late 1865, states like Mississippi established highly restrictive laws, nicknamed Black Codes, against African Americans, drawing the ire of many northern Republicans. When Radical Republicans passed legislation designed to protect the rights of freed people, Johnson vetoed it, causing an even greater split between Congress and the president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P4'>By 1866, Johnson’s popularity in the north had dropped significantly. Radical Republicans won electoral victories and in 1867 implemented stricter Reconstruction policies, placing the former Confederate states under military rule. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over policy disagreements, Republicans in Congress impeached him. He barely survived conviction in the United States Senate in 1868, but his political influence had essentially ended. The Republican Party chose Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant as its next presidential candidate, and Johnson returned to Tennessee when his term ended in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52439P5'>Although unpopular in the north, Johnson was welcomed home in Tennessee by residents who appreciated his political battle against Radical Republicans in Washington, D.C. He won an election to the United States Senate in 1875, but served only a few weeks before dying of a stroke on July 31, 1875. He was married to Eliza McCardle and had five children. Johnson is buried in Greeneville, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

The city of Washington became the federal capital on February 27, 1801 and established as Washington, D.C. on February 24, 1801, when the city boundaries were expanded to include the entire Federal District of Columbia.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P0'>The United States <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 as the foundational code of laws for the United States of America. It was crafted in 1787 by a convention in Philadelphia originally tasked only with amending the existing <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi>, which had loosely combined the states under a weak central government. Delegates chose to set aside the articles entirely and create a stronger federal government made of three branches: the legislative (comprising two separate parts, the House of Representatives and the Senate), the judicial (led by the Supreme Court), and the executive (headed by the President of the United States). The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> sought to carefully balance competing interests regarding state and national authority, as well as large and small state representation. It also created a more direct relationship between Americans and the national government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P1'>The convention’s departure from its original mandate to amend the <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi> generated controversy, particularly among Americans who opposed placing a distant central authority of the states. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters advocated the need for a stronger national government and explained that the federal system preserved state authority for most local matters. To guarantee enough support for ratification, the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters agreed to add an addendum to more directly protect individuals' specific rights and freedoms. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 and the new United States government began in early 1789. Shortly afterwards, the new Congress adopted several amendments to the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>, ten of which were ratified by three-fourths of the states and became known as the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments guaranteed certain rights for American citizens. Since then, seventeen additional amendments have been ratified to the United States Constitution. Three of them—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments—were adopted between 1865 and 1870, during the Reconstruction Era. The Thirteenth Amendment formally abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment provides equal protection for all laws and the Fifteenth Amendment protects voting rights for American citizens regardless of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” both specifically to combat racial discrimination against African Americans following the end of slavery.

C. and the commanding officers of the  Union Army on the warfront. (Wikipedia; "The War Effort: The Telegraph Office," Mr. Lincoln's White House)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
