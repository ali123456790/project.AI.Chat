                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32022696P0'>William Gannaway Brownlow, popularly known as “Parson” Brownlow, was a newspaper publisher, minister, and politician who served as governor of Tennessee during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P1'>Born on August 29, 1805, in Wythe County, Virginia, Brownlow was orphaned at the age of 10 and lived with an uncle until adulthood. He initially studied carpentry, but chose to become a Methodist minister after a religious conversion in 1825. The next year, he joined a travelling ministry and over the next several years preached to different communities across North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Brownlow’s time as an itinerant preacher was marked by his strong criticism of Baptists. His verbal and written condemnations of that denomination nearly led to his lynching in South Carolina. Brownlow married Eliza O’Brian in 1836 in Tennessee and ceased his traveling ministry work. However, he continued to write pamphlets to promote Methodism, and condemn other religious groups, leading to his nickname and reputation as the “Fighting Parson.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P2'>Having settled in Tennessee, Brownlow became a notable newspaper publisher in the late 1830s. His work, primarily published through his newspaper the <hi rend='italic'>Whig</hi>, embraced his new cause--support of Whig Party politics. Brownlow criticized his political opponents as harshly as he had his religious antagonists, leading to heightened emotions in his town and even physical confrontations. In one instance, Brownlow attacked a rival newspaper editor, Landon Carter Haynes, in the streets of Jonesborough, Tennessee, with a cane. Haynes drew a handgun and shot Brownlow in the leg.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P3'>In 1845, Brownlow ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives against Andrew Johnson, future president of the United States. Brownlow used his newspaper to level several personal attacks against Johnson, including accusations that Johnson was an illegitimate child, related to murders and thieves, and an atheist. Johnson won the election, but it was not the last time the two men faced off politically.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P4'>In the 1850s, Brownlow joined the temperance (anti-alcohol) movement and joined the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigration political movement). He again used his writings to promote his new causes, railing against Catholics, immigrants, and Democratic politicians as threats to the United States. His views on slavery also transformed during this period. He had opposed slavery as a young man, even signing an abolitionist petition in 1834, and during the 1840s, he had supported the American Colonization Society, which sought to send liberated slaves to Liberia, Africa. By the 1850s, he expressed strong pro-slavery views, even arguing that the institution was supported by God. He challenged northern abolitionists to debate the merits of slavery, and in 1858 conducted one such debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in which he predicted that slavery would exist forever.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P5'>Despite his southern roots and defense of slavery, Brownlow opposed southern secession following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860. After his state of Tennessee joined the Confederacy, Brownlow continued to use his newspaper to print condemnations of secessionists. He supported an effort to separate the largely pro-Union eastern section of Tennessee from the rest of the state, and was famously quoted as saying, “We intend to fight the secessionists until hell freezes over, and then fight them on ice.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P6'>Brownlow was arrested by Confederate authorities on charges of treason. He eventually secured his release and traveled to Union lines, becoming a celebrity in the north for his defiance against the Confederacy. He conducted a speaking tour across the northeast and published a critical book about secession. He returned to Tennessee after Union armies secured most of the state and restarted his newspaper in Knoxville.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P7'>In January 1865, the Unionist government of Tennessee nominated Brownlow for governor. He was the only candidate and won by a vote of 23,352 to 35, although ex-Confederates were not permitted to vote. Brownlow supported the Lincoln administration’s policies, including the Thirteenth Amendment which abolished slavery. He also took a hard line on former Confederates, imposing fines on people wearing Confederate uniforms and prohibiting Confederate ministers from conducting ceremonies like marriages. Brownlow then turned against Andrew Johnson, who as vice president was elevated to the presidency with the assassination of Lincoln. Brownlow believed Johnson was too lenient on the former Confederates, and he even suspected the president was sympathetic enough to lead a second southern rebellion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P8'>Brownlow worked to protect the rights of African Americans in Tennessee. Despite his previous outspoken support of slavery and white supremacy, during Reconstruction he argued that a loyal Black man was a better citizen than a disloyal white man. He strengthened the Tennessee militia to combat the Ku Klux Klan and other conservative white groups that sought to limit Black civil rights. In 1869, his last year in office, Brownlow placed several Tennessee counties under martial law to combat violence against Republicans and Black residents.

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P9'>Following his two terms as governor, Brownlow was elected to the U.S. Senate.

He is buried in Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville, Tennessee.
