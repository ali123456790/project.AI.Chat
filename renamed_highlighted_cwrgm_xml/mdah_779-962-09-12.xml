              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P0'>In the nineteenth century, across the United States, women’s opportunities were limited. The vestiges of an element of English common law called coverture ensured women did not have a legal identity. Their fathers covered them until they married, at which point they fell under the legal identity of their husbands. In practice, this meant that women did not legally own property and did not even control their own children. They could not own businesses and could not bring suit to court. Rather, they had to rely on a husband, father, or other male relative. The concept of “Republican Motherhood,” however, ensured that some education was necessary. This ideal, which emerged after the American Revolution, held that mothers were central to raising virtuous boys who would one day shape the Republic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P1'>In the North, the Second Great Awakening and the rise of the middle class expanded women’s opportunities further. Heavily centered around the family, the middle class celebrated not an authoritative father but a loving mother. Separate spheres ideology held that men and women occupied different elements of society. Men were responsible for the public sphere, including politics and work outside of the home. Women took care of the domestic sphere, pushing temperance, self-control, hard work, honesty, and frugality. They had considerable power within this space, including nurturing children. Embracing these domestic ideals also pushed northern women into the public domain through such crusades as temperance and moral reform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P2'>In the agrarian South, patriarchy reigned supreme, where a male patriarchal “master” headed a family of dependents – women, children, and enslaved people, when financially possible. Here, men were virtually the law within the household. This hierarchy – and the dependent role women maintained – played a crucial role in uniting the South in its defense of slavery, for all white men were essentially “masters.” Operating with very little personal freedom, elite white women in the South also played a central role in managing the plantation household, overseeing large staffs of enslaved men and women within the domestic sphere. This expectation included embracing the violence that was necessary to maintaining the institution of slavery. Completely dependent on a male patriarch, women working outside of the home were limited to the occupations of the domestic realm, including working as a seamstress or milliner, teaching, domestic service, and sex work. Significantly lower paid than their male counterparts, these limitations ensured that poor white women often carried the burden of poverty in the South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P3'>The institution of slavery ensured that Black women faced still more limited circumstances. As chattel, they were defined by their productive capacity – their ability to produce in the field, the enslaver’s household, or reproductively. Subject to violence, rape, and the inability to control even their own children, enslaved women found ways to carve out elements of independency. Although enslavers sometimes forced enslaved men and women to engage in marital unions with spouses of the enslaver’s choosing, Black women often selected their own husbands, resisting the fact that these unions were only rarely enshrined in law and were subordinate to an enslaver’s desires. As far as was possible, these marriages followed the gendered division of labor typical throughout the U.S., where women were responsible for cooking, cleaning, and caring for children. Within these private households and the slave quarters more generally, enslaved women also engaged in the religions and cultural practices of their ancestry, including Caribbean and African influences.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P4'>The Civil War expanded women’s roles in society. Still within the realm of the domestic sphere, women in both regions formed Ladies Military Aid Societies, with an eye towards supporting soldiers. These groups sent domestic necessities, including clothing, socks, and bandages, and they eventually embraced nursing. In the South, societies even began making cartridges and preparing sandbags. Such work and the broader need for women to maintain the household without a male counterpart ensured that women took on new responsibilities, many of which pushed them deeper into the public sphere than was possible before the war. In the South, poor women even became active in demanding that the Confederacy support their families, even rioting publicly in places like Richmond. As many Black women escaped to the U.S. Army during the war, marriage often became their first goal, even forcing the federal government to implement new policies that protected and supported their families. They seized this opportunity to rebuild the families that had long-been severed by the institution of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P5'>After the war, many of these expansions in women’s roles declined, but they did not disappear entirely. Northern women became active in providing support for veterans and their families, even helping navigating the pension system, while southern white women became active in burying the dead, memorialization, and the emergence of the Lost Cause mythology. This idea downplayed the role of slavery in the war and celebrated the Confederacy for its protection of families, within which, women were vital. Black women continued to lobby the U.S. government, including utilizing the Freedman’s Bureau to relocate members of their families and to solidify those unions. With intimate knowledge of the skills and length of individual tasks, they also played pivotal roles in negotiating the financial value of their labor and of negotiating the terms of free labor more generally. Nevertheless, the sexual victimization of Black women continued, becoming a prominent feature of the postwar South.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32033187P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines homeless or unhoused persons as "people who do not have a home, usually because they are [impoverished]" (Cambridge Dictionary), but one scholar notes that classifying homelessness based on the lack of fixed domicile narrows the definition of a varied and diverse experience, arguing instead for a more fluid definition of homeless persons as those experiencing "the lack of a fixed abode, an impoverished lifestyle, and, in most cases, weak or nonexistent family support" (Kusmer, <hi rend='italic'>Down and Out, on the Road</hi>, 16).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32033187P1'>Homelessness expanded rapidly in the nineteenth-century United States, in large part due to rapid industrialization and the wide income disparity associated with it. While economic depressions contributed heavily to homelessness, "even during prosperous times workers might be forced into the [homeless] class as a result of seasonal unemployment, automation, or industrial accidents" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 27). Prior to the Civil War, few homeless people lived in the American South. However, homelessness expanded rapidly in the South in the 1870s in part because improved transportation on railroads provided means by which homeless people could easily travel through the region and because the collapse of chattel slavery increased the availability of seasonal agricultural work for both white and Black people in the South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32033187P2'>Reform groups, generally associated with evangelical Christian denominations, often attempted to aid homeless persons by providing temporary shelter and food. Certain states also made institutional efforts to aid homeless persons by establishing almshouses or, most often, so-called "tramp rooms" in local police stations where homeless persons could temporarily stay overnight. However, few municipal or governmental authorities made institutional efforts to alleviate homelessness or to aid homeless persons, often arresting homeless persons as "vagrants" and sentencing them to varied periods in jail.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32033187P3'>Homelessness in the nineteenth-century United States, like so much else, was also subject to divisions of race and gender, as men were far more likely to experience homelessness than women, and African Americans of either sex more likely than whites (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 27). While nineteenth-century Americans used many terms to refer to homeless persons, many of such labels came laden with associations of criminality, laziness, or subversiveness and often helped further cement class inequality (Kusmer, <hi rend='italic'>Down and Out, on the Road</hi>, 8, 21). CWRGM uses the tag "Homeless persons" to emphasize one's personhood and not their social or class status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
