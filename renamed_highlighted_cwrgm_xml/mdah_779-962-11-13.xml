It became part of the newly created Adams County on April 1, 1799. It served as the capital of Mississippi Territory from 1798 until 1802, when it was replaced by Washington. It was reinstated as the capital from 1817 until 1820, when the capital was again replaced by Washington (which was later replaced by the current capital Jackson in 1822). Natchez serves as the county seat. (Wikipedia; Britannica; Mississippi Encyclopedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32122011P0'>The African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church was the first independent Protestant church to be founded by Black people in the United States. Created in Philadelphia in 1816 as a safe community for people of all races, the AME Church advocated equal rights throughout the nineteenth century. Within thirty years, the denomination had 296 churches and more than 17,000 members. The AME Church was predominantly in northern communities before the Civil War, due to restrictions against Black church activities in the south. However, after the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, new churches began opening among the newly free Black population in the south. An AME Church was established in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1866, which continues to serve as an active church into the twenty-first century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69344P0'>Stemming from the first century CE, Christianity is the world's largest religion with over two billion adherents. Its largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. A large influence on American identity and thought since the nation's founding, Christianity (particularly protestant evangelicalism) spread rapidly in the first three decades of the nineteenth century in the United States due to a series of religious revivals known as the Second Great Awakening. Many Americans injected Christian beliefs and practices into many of the major social, political, and legal debates in the country, including debates over slavery (both pro and antislavery stances), education, and social reform. Christianity also became a prominent religion among the enslaved in the United States, who employed Christian rhetoric and belief in much of their social, religious, and cultural activities, and critical to enslaved people's agency and resistance.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69344P1'>American Christianity in the nineteenth century primarily emphasized both one's individual responsibility to God as well as collective responsibility for one's neighbors. Also deeply important to American Christians in the nineteenth century was millennialism, or the belief that Jesus Christ would establish a 1,000 year reign of peace on earth. These combined elements produced efforts at reform with the intent to perfect society in order to invoke that reign. Many of the enslaved, however, applied millennialism to the hope of slavery's abolition. Numerous politicians also incorporated Christian imagery and language to justify "Manifest Destiny," or the idea that the God of Christianity ordained that the United States' borders would extend from the eastern to western coasts of North America, while both the Confederate and United States governments applied Christian rhetoric to support their causes. Christianity existed and still exists in many different and often competing forms, yet the development of those forms came to define much of American culture in the nineteenth century and beyond (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 285-327; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 8; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69342P0'>Episcopalians are members of the Episcopal Church, a denomination of Christianity that developed in the United States following the American Revolution. Anglican (Church of England) clergymen during the American Revolution were required to take oaths of allegiance to Great Britain, and, refusing to do so, many colonial Anglican clergymen broke off to form the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1789. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Episcopal Church was defined by its strictly hierarchical structure, Episcopalian form of church government (churches governed by bishops), elite social status of its membership, founding of numerous colleges and universities, and its involvement in progressive social movements (Britannica; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69343P0'>Methodists belong to "a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity whose origins, doctrine and practice derive from the life and teaching of John Wesley" (Wikipedia). Initially a reform movement within the Anglican Church (Church of England), Methodism derived from the teachings and doctrines of former Anglican priest John Wesley (1703-1791), whose rigorous "method" of personal devotion lent the denomination its name. Slow to develop in the United States in the eighteenth century, Methodism gained enormous traction in the nineteenth-century U. S. during the religious revivals collectively known as the Second Great Awakening. One scholar has noted that "no other association of any kind in the United States grew so dramatically and over so large an area in so short a time as Methodism" (Howe, What Hath God Wrought, 178). Nineteenth-century Methodism in the U. S. grew rapidly due to its emotional "camp meeting" revivals, often lasting for several days and drawing crowds in the hundreds or even thousands, aggressive evangelicalism in rural areas, focus on widespread literacy and investment in educational institutions, openness to women and African Americans in leadership, and exceptional, centralized organizational style. Methodism, more than any other Protestant Christian denomination, emphasized an individualism that transcended race, class, and gender and came to represent the Second Great Awakening and nineteenth-century American religion (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 1).
