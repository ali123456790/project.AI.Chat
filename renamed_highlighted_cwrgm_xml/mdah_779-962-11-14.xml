                    <p xml:id='OTPS32025440P0'>John Wynn Davidson was a Union general during the Civil War who also saw extensive service in the U.S. Army in the western territories.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P1'>Born on August 14, 1825, in Fairfax County, Virginia, Davidson graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1845. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the First U.S. Dragoons and saw extensive action in the Mexican-American War between 1846 and 1848. Afterwards, Davidson led U.S. troops in the western territories, conducting operations against Native Americans, including an attack against the Pomo tribe at Clear Lake, California, which has become known as the “Bloody Island Massacre.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P2'>With the outbreak of the Civil War, Davidson remained loyal to the Union and accepted command of a brigade within the Army of the Potomac in Virginia. He participated in battles at Yorktown and Williamsburg, and distinguished himself during the Seven Days Campaign outside of Richmond in 1862. He was then sent west and given command of the District of St. Louis and the Army of Southeast Missouri. In late 1863, Davidson led a division in the Army of Arkansas, scoring victories at the Battle of Bayou Fourche, leading to the Union capture of Little Rock.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P3'>In November and December 1864, Davidson led 4,000 Union cavalry soldiers in a raid from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, across southern Mississippi toward the Alabama border to cut the M&amp;O Railroad line. The effort was a diversion, meant to draw Confederate attention away from Confederate operations in Tennessee. Following that mission, Davidson was given administrative assignments in federally-occupied Mississippi. He remained there until January 1866 at the rank of brevet (honorary) major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P4'>After leaving Mississippi, Davidson returned to military duty in the western territories. He was made lieutenant colonel of the Tenth Cavalry Regiment, an African American unit nicknamed the “Buffalo Soldiers.” He earned the nickname “Black Jack” while commanding the Black cavalrymen. While in service in Kansas from 1868 to 1871, Davidson served as a professor of military science at Kansas State Agricultural College (modern-day Kansas State University).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025440P5'>In 1879, Davidson was promoted to colonel and given command of the Second Cavalry Regiment in Montana Territory. He died two years later, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He was married to Clara B. McGunnegle and had at least one child that survived to adulthood. Davidson is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32030164P0'>Thomas John Wood was a Union general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P1'>Born on September 25, 1823, in Munfordville, Kentucky, Wood graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1845. He briefly served as a staff officer to General Zachary Taylor during the Mexican-American War before requesting a combat assignment with the U.S. Second Dragoons (a cavalry unit) and serving with distinction at the Battle of Buena Vista in 1847. After the conflict with Mexico ended, Wood remained in service with the U.S. cavalry, serving at various outposts in the west. In 1859 he took a leave of absence from the army and traveled to Europe, returning in 1861 during the secession crisis and outbreak of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P2'>Back in the United States in 1861, Wood helped raise several regiments in Indiana. He received a promotion in the Union army to brigadier general in October 1861, and commanded a brigade during Union campaigns in Tennessee and Mississippi. He later received command of a division, leading troops at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and at the Battle of Murfreesboro, from December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863. During the Battle of Chickamauga in Georgia in September 1863, Wood received a surprising tactical order from the Union commander, General William S. Rosecrans, which instructed him to move his division out of position. The maneuver, which was based upon Rosecrans’ confusion of troop positions, would create a large gap in the Union line. Having been criticized by Rosecrans before for not immediately obeying directives, Wood followed the order exactly as written. A short time later, Confederate soldiers flooded into the hole left by Wood’s division and split the Union army, contributing to the federal defeat in the battle. Wood was among those blamed for the loss at Chickamauga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P3'>Wood performed very well in subsequent battles, including Missionary Ridge in Tennessee in November 1863 and at Lovejoy’s Station in Georgia in August 1864, helping him earn higher command. Despite a severe wound to the leg at Lovejoy’s Station, Wood returned to the field only weeks later and led an army corps during the Battle of Nashville in December 1864 and received promotion to major general in early 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P4'>Following the Civil War, Wood received orders to Mississippi for occupation duties. He served there until 1868, overseeing various Reconstruction activities, then retired from the army and moved to Dayton, Ohio.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P5'>Wood died on February 26, 1906, in Dayton. He had been married to Caroline Elizabeth Greer since 1861, and had three children. Wood is buried in the United States Military Academy Post Cemetery at West Point, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD86078P0'>Insurrection is an organized attempt by a group of people to overthrow a government, usually by violence. The cause, participants, and size of an effort to overthrow authority can vary. However, political and military officials typically respond to insurrections with legal and military force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P1'>The United States Constitution refers to insurrection in Article 1, Section 8, where it authorizes Congress to “provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.” Southern secession activities were not called insurrectionary until Confederates fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, turning the tense political debate over the legality of unilateral state secession into open warfare. At that point, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to enforce federal authority in the South and described the seceded states as engaging in insurrection. The term carries important legal connotations. International law does not recognize insurrectionists as legal combatants in war. By late 1861, Lincoln preferred to describe the South as in a state of “rebellion” instead of insurrection—a term with the same technical meaning, but which more strongly characterized the Confederacy as engaging in an unjust resistance to authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P2'>Confederates also feared political insurrection within the South during Civil War. Support for secession was not universal through the Southern states, and numerous communities—particularly in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, northern Alabama, and most famously western Virginia (which actually separated and created its own state of West Virginia in 1863)—harbored pro-Union sentiments. Confederate and secessionist state officials frequently described anti-Confederate resistance within these communities and other parts of the South as insurrectionary. They used state and Confederate military forces to suppress such opposition.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P3'>Nineteenth century Southerners most commonly used the term insurrection to describe physical resistance by slaves against their masters. When the Union Army began to employ African American soldiers in 1863, the Confederate government announced that white Union officers captured while commanding black soldiers would be executed for inciting “servile insurrection.” The Confederacy backed down from that threat when Lincoln’s administration responded that it would execute one Confederate prisoner for each Union soldier killed, but the policy reflected the long-standing Southern fear of slave insurrections or rebellions. Before, during, and even after the Civil War, white Southern officials called out local militias—or even unregulated groups of armed men—to reestablish authority over African Americans suspected or accused of insurrection, often with overly violent methods. (Gaines M. Foster, “What’s Not in a Name: The Naming of the American Civil War,” <hi rend='italic'>Journal of the Civil War Era</hi>, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Sept 2018), 417-419; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32035127P0'>The United States Army Department of Mississippi was a geographical command established on November 28, 1864. It was headquartered in Vicksburg and encompassed the states of Mississippi and Tennessee west of the Tennessee River. On January 17, 1865 the areas of Mississippi occupied by forces under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas were detached to the Department of the Cumberland, followed by western Tennessee on February 10, 1865. On May 17, 1865 western Mississippi was detached to the Department of the Gulf and re-attached on June 27, 1865. It was discontinued on August 6, 1866, its territory merged into the Department of the Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
