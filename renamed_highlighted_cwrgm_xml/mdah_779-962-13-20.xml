              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32167446P0'>An illegal apprenticeship is the abuse of the apprenticeship system by an employer to extract forced labor from a young worker.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32167446P1'>An apprenticeship is a career-training system in which an employer oversees the training and professional development of a young employee in a trade. Existing since the late medieval period, legitimate apprenticeships were common in Europe and in America until the early twentieth century. However, the system was also wrought with abuse, as employers had significant control over the lives of apprentices. Abusive and illegal apprenticeships became especially prevalent in the United States during the immediate aftermath of the Civil War and abolition of slavery, as former slave owners and other white business owners in the south used the practice of apprenticeship to draw young African Americans into forced and unpaid labor arrangements.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32167446P2'>Apprenticeships during the nineteenth century were intended to be mutually-beneficial relationships, in which the youthful apprentices would provide labor for a skilled employer for a set period of time, and in return learn the trade, and receive food, clothing, lodging, and an education. However, thousands of Black children were drawn into illegal apprenticeships in the south during the Reconstruction era without the benefits of an education or special care in regards to clothing and housing. Many contracts did not explicitly set conditions, and some employers refused to release their apprentices until government officials intervened.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32167446P3'>The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands—or the Freedmen’s Bureau—played a significant role in combating illegal apprenticeships, and using federal courts to liberate young Black laborers from employers who abused the apprenticeship system. In 1867, Chief Justice Salmon Chase released his circuit court opinion in Maryland for <hi rend='italic'>In re Turner</hi>, a case regarding apprentice Elizabeth Turner, declaring involuntary apprenticeships unconstitutional due to the Thirteenth Amendment. The decision had wide ranging implications and was soon used by Freedmen’s Bureau attorneys to overturn illegal labor arrangements across the country. (Wikipedia; Abdeena Barrie, “The Freedmen’s Bureau and Illegal Apprenticeships on Maryland’s Eastern Shore,” Enduring Connections; “Circuit Court Opinions: Chief Justice Salmon Portland Chase, <hi rend='italic'>In re Turner</hi> [1867], Federal Judicial Center)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
