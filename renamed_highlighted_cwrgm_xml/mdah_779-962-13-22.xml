                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32030164P0'>Thomas John Wood was a Union general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P1'>Born on September 25, 1823, in Munfordville, Kentucky, Wood graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1845. He briefly served as a staff officer to General Zachary Taylor during the Mexican-American War before requesting a combat assignment with the U.S. Second Dragoons (a cavalry unit) and serving with distinction at the Battle of Buena Vista in 1847. After the conflict with Mexico ended, Wood remained in service with the U.S. cavalry, serving at various outposts in the west. In 1859 he took a leave of absence from the army and traveled to Europe, returning in 1861 during the secession crisis and outbreak of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P2'>Back in the United States in 1861, Wood helped raise several regiments in Indiana. He received a promotion in the Union army to brigadier general in October 1861, and commanded a brigade during Union campaigns in Tennessee and Mississippi. He later received command of a division, leading troops at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and at the Battle of Murfreesboro, from December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863. During the Battle of Chickamauga in Georgia in September 1863, Wood received a surprising tactical order from the Union commander, General William S. Rosecrans, which instructed him to move his division out of position. The maneuver, which was based upon Rosecrans’ confusion of troop positions, would create a large gap in the Union line. Having been criticized by Rosecrans before for not immediately obeying directives, Wood followed the order exactly as written. A short time later, Confederate soldiers flooded into the hole left by Wood’s division and split the Union army, contributing to the federal defeat in the battle. Wood was among those blamed for the loss at Chickamauga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P3'>Wood performed very well in subsequent battles, including Missionary Ridge in Tennessee in November 1863 and at Lovejoy’s Station in Georgia in August 1864, helping him earn higher command. Despite a severe wound to the leg at Lovejoy’s Station, Wood returned to the field only weeks later and led an army corps during the Battle of Nashville in December 1864 and received promotion to major general in early 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P4'>Following the Civil War, Wood received orders to Mississippi for occupation duties. He served there until 1868, overseeing various Reconstruction activities, then retired from the army and moved to Dayton, Ohio.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P5'>Wood died on February 26, 1906, in Dayton. He had been married to Caroline Elizabeth Greer since 1861, and had three children. Wood is buried in the United States Military Academy Post Cemetery at West Point, New York.
