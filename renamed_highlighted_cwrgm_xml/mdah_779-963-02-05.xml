                    <p xml:id='OTPS32123963P0'>John C. Van Duzer was a newspaper editor, Union military officer during the Civil War, and telegraph official.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32123963P1'>Born on August 30, 1827, in Erie County, New York, Van Duzer was educated in public schools and apprenticed at a newspaper office in Utica. He also gained training in telegraphy and railroad work. When the Civil War broke out, Van Duzer volunteered for the military and eventually was commissioned as an officer in the Union telegraph service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32123963P2'>Van Duzer ran into conflict with General Ulysses S. Grant during the war over telegraph operations, and was arrested by Grant for defying his orders regarding the use of military telegraph lines for civilian messages. Van Duzer was supported by other officials, including Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, and was released from military confinement and returned to service. He finished the war as a lieutenant colonel and in charge of the United States military telegraph system within the Military Division of the Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32123963P3'>Following the war, Van Duzer helped develop telegraph service within the south. Then, in 1879, he returned north and to newspaper editing, spending nearly two decades as the editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Iron Port</hi> in Escanaba, Michigan. He died on March 3, 1898.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32026650P0'>James Madison Wells was an anti-secession figure in Louisiana during the Civil War who served as that state's governor during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026650P1'>Born to a wealthy family on January 7, 1808, near Alexandria, Louisiana, Wells attended school in Kentucky and Connecticut before studying law in Cincinnati, Ohio. He moved back to Louisiana in 1829 to oversee plantations owned by his family. He inherited large tracts of land and became a wealthy slaveowner. Not content with being only a planter, Wells became active in public office and political circles. He was first appointed sheriff of Rapides Parish in 1840 and participated in Whig meetings. He changed parties in the 1850s, joining the Democrats and supporting Stephen Douglas during the 1860 presidential election. He opposed secession and became a highly controversial figure in Louisiana during the Civil War. Confederate officials arrested him for his Unionist sentiments, but he was released. Later in the war, he led Unionist partisans in irregular warfare against Confederate military activities in Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026650P2'>Due to his staunch Unionist position, Wells became lieutenant governor in the pro-Union Louisiana state government in 1864. He was then made governor in 1865 and generally worked with federal Reconstruction officials. However, Wellsâ€™s support for the rights of free Blacks and former slaves was inconsistent. He supported Black voting rights, but appointed several former Confederates with white supremacist attitudes to state positions. Wells did little to prevent racial tension and violence in Louisiana in 1866, leading to his removal by U.S. Army officials in 1867.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026650P3'>Wells supported the Republican Party during the 1870s and accepted an appointment to oversee voting returns in Louisiana in 1873. His efforts helped overturn some fraudulent elections which had benefitted conservative white Democrats. He then received a federal position in 1874 as surveyor of customs at the Port of New Orleans and remained in that office until 1880.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026650P4'>Wells died on February 28, 1899. He was married to Mary Scott and had fourteen children. He is buried in Old Rapides Cemetery in Pineville, Louisiana.
