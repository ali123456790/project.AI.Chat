                    <p xml:id='OTPS51701P0'>Charles Edward Hooker was a Mississippi state representative, Confederate officer, the state’s attorney general, and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51701P1'>Born on April 9, 1825, in Union, South Carolina, Hooker was raised in the south but graduated from Harvard Law School in 1846. He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, and in 1848 became a practicing attorney. By 1850 he secured a position as district attorney in Mississippi, serving in that role until 1854. In 1859 he won election to the Mississippi state legislature.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51701P2'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election in November 1860, Hooker was appointed as a secession commissioner to South Carolina. He strongly supported southern separation from the Union, and upon Mississippi's secession he resigned his political seat to enlist in the military. Rising to the rank of captain, Hooker served with the First Regiment of Mississippi Light Artillery and took part in the Vicksburg campaign. He was severely wounded, resulting in the loss of an arm, during the fighting at Vicksburg in the summer of 1863. Despite the severity of his wound, Hooker remained in the army and received a promotion to colonel, commanding cavalry soldiers for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51701P3'>After the Civil War, Hooker reentered politics, and secured election in 1865 as attorney general for Mississippi. However, federal authorities overturned much of Mississippi’s rebuilt civil government due to efforts by former Confederates to enact harsh restriction against African American civil rights. As a result Hooker was removed from office, along with several other conservative white Democrats. In 1868, Hooker was again elected attorney general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51701P4'>In the 1870s Hooker pursued national level political office. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from March 1875 to March 1883. In 1884, he served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, where he stood out compared to many of his former Confederate colleagues with his more progressive approach to race relations. He opposed policies against Chinese immigration (an issue driven by large numbers of Chinese immigrants being used for labor on railroads in the U.S. west), and declared that African Americans were full citizens—a particularly radical position in the post-Reconstruction south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51701P5'>Hooker continued to serve various terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, holding a seat from 1887 to 1895, and then again from 1901 to 1903. When he was not in office, Hooker practiced law in Jackson, Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51701P6'>He was married to Francis Cecilia LeBreton. The couple had four children. He died on January 3, 1914. Hooker is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32030164P0'>Thomas John Wood was a Union general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P1'>Born on September 25, 1823, in Munfordville, Kentucky, Wood graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1845. He briefly served as a staff officer to General Zachary Taylor during the Mexican-American War before requesting a combat assignment with the U.S. Second Dragoons (a cavalry unit) and serving with distinction at the Battle of Buena Vista in 1847. After the conflict with Mexico ended, Wood remained in service with the U.S. cavalry, serving at various outposts in the west. In 1859 he took a leave of absence from the army and traveled to Europe, returning in 1861 during the secession crisis and outbreak of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P2'>Back in the United States in 1861, Wood helped raise several regiments in Indiana. He received a promotion in the Union army to brigadier general in October 1861, and commanded a brigade during Union campaigns in Tennessee and Mississippi. He later received command of a division, leading troops at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and at the Battle of Murfreesboro, from December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863. During the Battle of Chickamauga in Georgia in September 1863, Wood received a surprising tactical order from the Union commander, General William S. Rosecrans, which instructed him to move his division out of position. The maneuver, which was based upon Rosecrans’ confusion of troop positions, would create a large gap in the Union line. Having been criticized by Rosecrans before for not immediately obeying directives, Wood followed the order exactly as written. A short time later, Confederate soldiers flooded into the hole left by Wood’s division and split the Union army, contributing to the federal defeat in the battle. Wood was among those blamed for the loss at Chickamauga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P3'>Wood performed very well in subsequent battles, including Missionary Ridge in Tennessee in November 1863 and at Lovejoy’s Station in Georgia in August 1864, helping him earn higher command. Despite a severe wound to the leg at Lovejoy’s Station, Wood returned to the field only weeks later and led an army corps during the Battle of Nashville in December 1864 and received promotion to major general in early 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P4'>Following the Civil War, Wood received orders to Mississippi for occupation duties. He served there until 1868, overseeing various Reconstruction activities, then retired from the army and moved to Dayton, Ohio.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P5'>Wood died on February 26, 1906, in Dayton. He had been married to Caroline Elizabeth Greer since 1861, and had three children. Wood is buried in the United States Military Academy Post Cemetery at West Point, New York.

In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

Once communities became more established, circuit courts maintained permanent locations. (State of Mississippi Judiciary)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD92926P0'>During the Civil War, Confederate military authorities used different levels of operational command to oversee their growing military forces and to respond to federal campaigns against the south. The military department proved to be one of the more effective levels of command for territorial areas. The department commanders reported directly to the Confederate War Department and Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Initially Confederate officials created military departments only for areas directly under federal attack. As the war developed, they created departments to cover the entire Confederacy. Confederate authorities restructured the departments as the war developed, and Union forces captured some parts of the Confederacy or military campaigns created new military needs in geographical areas. Some old departments were dissolved, or divided, and territories placed within new departments designed for contemporary needs.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD92926P1'>The first department to include parts of Mississippi was the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, established on October 1, 1862. It existed until January 28, 1864, when Confederate authorities created the new department of Alabama and East Mississippi. That department lasted until August 15, 1864, and the creation of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana, which lasted until May 1865 and the end of the war.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32130587P0'>During the American Revolution, the Continental Army created the Adjutant General and the Inspector General as two different positions within the military. The Adjutant General was the administrative and personnel support element of the military, while the Inspector General was responsible for assessing and investigating internal military matters. After American independence and the reduction of the military, the Adjutant General’s Office took over most Inspector General duties. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Union and Confederate officials had to restructure the Adjutant General and Inspector General duties to support the massive expansion of military forces. State militaries, like in Mississippi, also grew rapidly in response to the war, requiring robust administrative and inspection capabilities. Mississippi placed all of those responsibilities onto the Adjutant and Inspector General Office. The Adjutant and Inspector General, as well as his assistants, helped facilitate the recruitment, enlistment, and organization of new troops in Mississippi, as well as oversaw rules and regulations and supply issues.
