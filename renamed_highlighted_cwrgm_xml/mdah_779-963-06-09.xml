                    <p xml:id='OTPS62969P0'>William Henry Seward was a politician from New York who served as United States Secretary of State during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P1'>Born in Florida, New York, on May 16, 1801, Seward was educated at local schools and graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York, in 1820. He studied law and became a practicing attorney in Auburn, New York. Soon afterwards, he became involved in politics. He joined the Whig Party and won a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1830. He proved quite popular within the Whig Party and received the party’s nomination for governor of New York in 1834. He lost the election and resumed practicing law in Auburn, New York, but retained his standing with the party. Four years later, Seward won the 1838 gubernatorial election and served as governor until 1842. In office, Seward proved sympathetic to African American residents of New York, signing several laws that protected Black rights. He also supported laws that gave fugitive slaves who fled to the state from the south right to jury trials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P2'>Upon leaving the governor’s office, Seward returned to practicing law in Auburn. In 1849, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and became a leading anti-slavery voice in Washington, D.C. In the mid-1850s, with the slavery debate dominating national politics and leading to the dissolution of the Whig Party, Seward joined the new Republican Party. His long history of anti-slavery advocacy and stellar political resume made him a top contender for the Republican Party’s nomination for president in 1860. However, he lost the nomination to Abraham Lincoln, whose western roots and more moderate anti-slavery reputation appealed to more Republicans. Additionally, Seward’s previous political support of immigrant rights and association with infamous political boss Thurlow Weed in New York were unpopular among many Republicans and worked against his nomination.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P3'>Seward was initially dismissive of Lincoln, due to the latter's unrefined background and mannerisms, and his political inexperience. (Lincoln’s previous time in Washington, D.C., amounted to a single term in the U.S. House of Representatives in the late 1840s.) However, Seward backed Lincoln as the party candidate during the 1860 presidential election. When Lincoln won the presidency, he selected Seward for U.S. Secretary of State.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P4'>During the secession crisis that followed the 1860 election, Seward used his political connections in a vain effort to prevent southern states from seceding and to facilitate peace within the already contentious situation. He took a stronger public position during the crisis than Lincoln, who remained relatively quiet during the period between the election in November 1860 and inauguration in March 1861. Seward generally supported Lincoln’s policies, and the two privately coordinated many of Seward’s actions in response to secession, but Seward privately believed he would be a guiding figure for the new president in the upcoming administration. Additionally, Seward overestimated the power he would hold over Lincoln in regards to foreign affairs. Despite his overestimation of his influence, and his doubts of Lincoln’s abilities, Seward’s opinion of the president changed as the war progressed. By the summer of 1861, Seward privately praised Lincoln as calm, measured, and a quick learner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P5'>Lincoln and Seward worked well together, with the president respecting his secretary’s suggestions regarding policy and political timing. For example, in the summer of 1862, when Lincoln privately informed his cabinet that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation—declaring that all slaves in Confederate areas would be considered free by federal authorities—Seward urged cautioned. Seward’s anti-slavery sentiments were beyond reproach, but he argued that that the public would interpret a bold executive action as desperation by an administration losing the war. Seward advised Lincoln to wait and announce it after a great Union military victory. Lincoln agreed with this advice and held on to the proclamation for nearly two months, until Union forces defeated Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Antietam, Maryland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P6'>Preventing foreign interference in the Civil War was among Seward’s most important jobs. He proved more aggressive in his opposition to European countries who flirted with the idea of supporting the Confederacy. Lincoln took a more moderate stance, determined to avoid going to war with a foreign power while in the midst of fighting the Confederacy. Ultimately, Seward helped present a strong and determined U.S. government dedicated to defeating secession and, after the announcement of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, ending slavery, which kept Britain and France officially neutral.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P7'>On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth shot and mortally wounded President Lincoln at a play in Washington, D.C. Simultaneously, an associate of Booth, named Lewis Powell, tried to assassinate Seward. The secretary of state was bedridden at his townhouse in Washington, D.C., with a broken jaw following a carriage accident. Powell gained access into Seward’s home by claiming to have medicine. Seward’s son Frederick stopped Powell inside the house and asked for the medicine. Powell drew a revolver and tried to shoot the young man. The gun misfired, so Powell hit Frederick in the head with the handgun, stunning him, and rushed into Seward’s room. He attacked Seward, who was laying on his bed, with a knife, stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck. A Union soldier and another of Seward’s sons, Augustus, who were in the room charged Powell and eventually forced him to run from the house. In total, five men were wounded by Powell during the attack—Seward, two of his sons, the military guard, and a messenger who Powell stabbed while running out of the house. They all survived. Seward was badly wounded, but a metal brace supporting his face and neck deflected Powell’s slashes, preventing any of his injuries from being mortal. Powell was subsequently found and arrested by military authorities. He was executed on July 7, 1865, by hanging with three other people convicted of plotting or aiding in the assassination of Lincoln and other federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P8'>Seward’s recovery took several weeks, at which time Vice President Andrew Johnson took Lincoln’s place in the White House. When he returned to his duties, he tried to maintain a good working relationship with Johnson, but found himself defending the increasingly unpopular president against radicals within the Republican Party. Seward’s most notable act as secretary of state after the Civil War was his purchase of Alaska territory from Russia in 1867. He negotiated the entire purchase for $7.2 million (roughly $120 million today). Initially lambasted by political rivals as “Seward’s Folly,” who complained that the secretary of state had spent millions of dollars on distant section of undeveloped land while the country still had numerous western territories, attitudes changed within a few years when prospectors fond gold in Alaska and many other settlers learned of the great natural resources there.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS62969P9'>Seward’s tenure as secretary of state ended with the inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant as president in 1869. He retired from public office and traveled around the world. Three years later, on October 10, 1872, he died, only hours after first complaining of shortness of breath. He had been married to Frances Adeline Miller, who had passed away in 1865. The couple had six children. Seward is buried at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York.
