                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
