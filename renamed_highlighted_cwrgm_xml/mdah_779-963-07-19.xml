                    <p xml:id='OTPS63300P0'>William Wirt Adams was a Mississippi state legislator and general in the Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P1'>Born on March 22, 1819, in Frankfort, Kentucky, Adams moved as a child with his family to Natchez, Mississippi. He graduated from Bardstown College in Kentucky in 1839 and shortly afterwards traveled to the Republic of Texas. He volunteered for military service in Texas, participating in campaigns against Native Americans. Adams later returned to Mississippi, married Sarah Huger Mayarant in 1850, and became a successful businessman in Jackson and Vicksburg. The couple had five children over the next few years, and in 1858, Adams won a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives, serving two terms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P2'>When Mississippi seceded from the Union in January 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Adams received an appointment as state commissioner to Louisiana to help facilitate that state’s separation from the Union. In February 1861, Adams received an invitation from the Confederate States of America’s president, Jefferson Davis, to serve as Confederate Postmaster General, but he turned the offer down. Instead, Adams raised a cavalry regiment in Mississippi. Accepted into Confederate service in August 1861, Adams led his regiment in several engagements over the next several months, including Shiloh and Corinth. During Ulysses S. Grant’s campaign to capture Vicksburg, Adams’ regiment conducted patrols, scouted Union activities, and guarded key locations in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P3'>Adams received a promotion to brigadier general in September 1863. He commanded Confederate troops during engagements at Port Hudson and Baton Rouge, and unsuccessfully tried to stop William Tecumseh Sherman’s campaign to Meridian, Mississippi, in February 1864. Adams did score a moral victory when he and his men captured a Union gunboat, USS <hi rend='italic'>Petrel</hi>, on the Yazoo River. The Confederate soldiers carried away eight naval guns and then burned the ship. During the latter part of the war, Adams served alongside famed Confederate cavalry commander Nathan Bedford Forrest in Alabama, before surrendering to Union troops in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P4'>Following the Civil War, Adams returned to Mississippi. He variously stayed in Vicksburg and Jackson. In 1880 he received an appointment as a state revenue agent; five years later he accepted an appointment as postmaster in Jackson by President Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63300P5'>During the late 1880s, Adams became embroiled in a personal dispute with John H. Martin, the editor of the <hi rend='italic'>New Mississippian</hi>. On May 1, 1888, the two men encountered each other on a street in Jackson. The two men began arguing and then each pulled pistols and fired. Both men died at the scene. Adams is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P1'>Born on November 22, 1816, in Lebanon, Tennessee, Yerger attended the University of Nashville, studied law, and became a practicing attorney at the age of 21. He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1837 and established a successful law practice. He belonged to the Whig Party, an association some in Mississippi later said slowed his ascent within the state’s strong Democratic public and political setting. However, in 1850 he was elected to Mississippi’s High Bench of Errors and Appeals (later called the Supreme Court). He served on the Court for three years, before returning to legal practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32027652P2'>During the Civil War, Yerger served in the Mississippi legislature, and was active in the immediate postwar effort to reconstruct the state government under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient policies for readmission to the Union. He established a very strong reputation as an attorney and jurist in Mississippi, so much so that the state’s Supreme Court adjourned for a day in his honor upon receiving word of his death on June 7, 1872, at the age of 55. Yerger had been married to Malvina Hogan Rucks and had five children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery at Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024374P0'>The English nationality is defined as "relating to or from England" (Cambridge Dictionary). English immigrants to the United States in the nineteenth century fared better than many other immigrant groups and seldom faced the nativism and xenophobia others, as many native-born, white, protestant Americans viewed the British as possessing a shared ethnic, cultural, and linguistic background. Many Englishmen immigrated to the United States to seek economic prosperity, many of which intended to return to England after accumulating wealth. English immigrants often prospered economically in the U. S., having arrived as skilled laborers, particularly weavers, from a highly industrialized nation. English Americans fought on both sides of the American Civil War and contributed greatly to U. S. society in the nineteenth century and beyond. CWRGM uses the tag "Nationality-English" to differentiate between people of specifically English origin. For more detailed information about the relationship between the United States and Great Britain, see the tag "Nationality-British" which incorporates all of the United Kingdom, including England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol 2, 73-6; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69344P0'>Stemming from the first century CE, Christianity is the world's largest religion with over two billion adherents. Its largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. A large influence on American identity and thought since the nation's founding, Christianity (particularly protestant evangelicalism) spread rapidly in the first three decades of the nineteenth century in the United States due to a series of religious revivals known as the Second Great Awakening. Many Americans injected Christian beliefs and practices into many of the major social, political, and legal debates in the country, including debates over slavery (both pro and antislavery stances), education, and social reform. Christianity also became a prominent religion among the enslaved in the United States, who employed Christian rhetoric and belief in much of their social, religious, and cultural activities, and critical to enslaved people's agency and resistance.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69344P1'>American Christianity in the nineteenth century primarily emphasized both one's individual responsibility to God as well as collective responsibility for one's neighbors. Also deeply important to American Christians in the nineteenth century was millennialism, or the belief that Jesus Christ would establish a 1,000 year reign of peace on earth. These combined elements produced efforts at reform with the intent to perfect society in order to invoke that reign. Many of the enslaved, however, applied millennialism to the hope of slavery's abolition. Numerous politicians also incorporated Christian imagery and language to justify "Manifest Destiny," or the idea that the God of Christianity ordained that the United States' borders would extend from the eastern to western coasts of North America, while both the Confederate and United States governments applied Christian rhetoric to support their causes. Christianity existed and still exists in many different and often competing forms, yet the development of those forms came to define much of American culture in the nineteenth century and beyond (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 285-327; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 8; Wikipedia).
