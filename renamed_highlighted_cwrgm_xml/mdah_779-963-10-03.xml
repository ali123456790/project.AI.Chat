                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS86155P0'>John H. Echols was secretary of state, state treasurer, and a revenue agent in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P1'>Born on September 1, 1835, in Huntsville, Alabama, Echols moved to Jackson, Mississippi, during his childhood. He worked for the state government as a young man, and impressed Mississippi officials so much with his intellect and abilities that he was appointed secretary of state during the Civil War. Shortly after the war ended, Echols was appointed state treasurer. He held the position until 1869, maintaining a reputation for integrity and intelligence.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P2'>In 1871, he took a job as a commissioner and agent of the Mobile &amp; Northwestern Railroad, a position that required salesmanship to receive land and money donations to the railroad’s development. Then, in 1876, he was appointed a revenue agent for Mississippi, a position created that year by the state legislature to investigate and litigate cases in which county tax collections were not properly submitted to the state government. He worked as the revenue agent until 1880.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS86155P3'>Echols suffered from Bright’s disease—a kidney ailment—and died on January 29, 1882, after weeks of failing health. He was married twice, first to Medora Ware, who passed away in 1875. He then married Sarah Schackleford. Echols is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32099655P0'>During the nineteenth century, Mississippi operated a sporadic hospital system, which was primarily focused on creating state institutions to provide mental health care for people imprisoned in the state's penitentiary in Jackson and the Mississippi State Hospital, which operated in Jackson from 1855 to 1926 when it was moved to Rankin County. Otherwise medical and mental health care was typically handled locally, especially for enslaved people on plantations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32086326P0'>A charitable organization, or charity, is a group dedicated to providing support, through funds or other resources, to people in need. Early charities were most often religiously-based, inspired by tenets of the faith to care for people. During the Enlightenment era of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which emphasized philanthropy, education, and equality among people, some wealthy individuals established charities. This continued into the nineteenth century, especially with the Industrial Revolution which saw the influx of people into harsh living conditions in cities and manufacturing areas. A small number of charities have been guided by political interests (ie. providing resources to people to curry favor), or financial benefits, such as tax reductions. Charitable groups typically provide food, medical support, clothing, and education to those in poverty, or suffering due to natural or man-made disasters. Some charity efforts involved the long-term, or permanent institutions, such as hospitals, orphanages, schools. Most charities are volunteer or non-profit organizations, where members are not paid for their work and all funds not needed for the actual functioning of the charity are dedicated to providing resources to others.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD64105P0'>Widows were classified as women whose legal husband died and they had not legally remarried (Cambridge Dictionary). Due to the bloodshed of the American Civil War, the United States saw a rapid increase in widowhood in the mid-to-late-nineteenth century; one estimate puts the number of widows at over 200,000 (Essential Civil War Curriculum). The Civil War altered antebellum patterns of widowhood by lowering the average age of widows, since many of those who lost their husbands to the war were in their twenties or thirties, and increasing the number of pregnant widows. Since American coverture legally subsumed a woman's identity under her husbands', many widows had no choice but to quickly remarry for social and economic protection.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD64105P1'>The Civil War also altered antebellum grieving traditions in that the presence of so many widows, often many within the same community, became more visible due to their numbers. Antebellum social etiquette also stipulated that a woman grieve her husband for roughly two and a half years, while the experience of war often led widows not only to stop mourning but to start rebuilding their lives (and finding other partners) far quicker. In the South, many women inherited large estates and numerous enslaved people upon their husbands' death, becoming solely responsible for maintaining operations and adopting the role of enslaver.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD64105P2'>Widows in both the North and South played outsized roles in commemorating the Civil War and deeply impacted the war's popular memory. Women were societally expected to remember their husbands as honorable, infusing that memory into the statuary and literature of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Antebellum social and legal practices also ensured that women were generally financially dependent upon their husbands, and widowhood thereby faced many women with poverty. Reform agencies therefore often targeted widows in their charitable work, and the widows themselves sought financial assistance from the federal government by applying for pensions, expanding the American welfare state. While widowhood existed prominently throughout the nineteenth century, the Civil War ultimately increased the number of widows and radically altered their places in American life (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32034121P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines a veteran as "someone who has been in the armed forces during a war" (Cambridge Dictionary). The experiences of Civil War veterans varied as much as their combat experiences. Veterans of both the Union and Confederacy suffered debilitating injuries that plagued their postwar lives, while many others rose to economic and political prominence based on their wartime service. Veterans often joined veterans' associations like the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) for Union veterans or the United Confederate Veterans (UCV) for Confederate veterans to receive support, remain in community with those who shared their experiences, and to work for their respective communities. Many veterans, like those of other wars, suffered from mental illnesses based on their experiences, particularly what is now known as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Unfortunately, nineteenth-century medicine had not diagnosed this condition and thereby provided little support for sufferers. However, the federal government set up veterans' homes and a pension system in which veterans with disabilities caused by their wartime service could receive financial aid or a place to live. Veterans also played a crucial role in shaping Civil War memory through their participation in memorial parades and festivities, erection of commemorative statues, and contributions to literary and historical magazines and journals. Black Civil War veterans often experienced the postwar era differently. While nominally integrated, many GAR posts in the South were segregated, and the pension system frequently ignored or denied Black applicants. However, many Black veterans also received a greater degree of respect from both whites and Blacks in their communities and achieved greater financial success due to their service. While their experiences may have differed, veterans of the Civil War played an important role in the late-nineteenth century and in shaping how Americans perceived the war well into the twentieth (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
