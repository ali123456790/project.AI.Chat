                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

There were no parades or commemorations by the city; no delegations from Baltimore or the state of Maryland attended. The event hall had United States flags displayed along the walls, but many of the tables featured raffles or sales of portraits of Confederate heroes such as Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. The event was highly successful, pulling in $160,000 dollars (more than $2 million in modern currency).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD64105P0'>Widows were classified as women whose legal husband died and they had not legally remarried (Cambridge Dictionary). Due to the bloodshed of the American Civil War, the United States saw a rapid increase in widowhood in the mid-to-late-nineteenth century; one estimate puts the number of widows at over 200,000 (Essential Civil War Curriculum). The Civil War altered antebellum patterns of widowhood by lowering the average age of widows, since many of those who lost their husbands to the war were in their twenties or thirties, and increasing the number of pregnant widows. Since American coverture legally subsumed a woman's identity under her husbands', many widows had no choice but to quickly remarry for social and economic protection.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD64105P1'>The Civil War also altered antebellum grieving traditions in that the presence of so many widows, often many within the same community, became more visible due to their numbers. Antebellum social etiquette also stipulated that a woman grieve her husband for roughly two and a half years, while the experience of war often led widows not only to stop mourning but to start rebuilding their lives (and finding other partners) far quicker. In the South, many women inherited large estates and numerous enslaved people upon their husbands' death, becoming solely responsible for maintaining operations and adopting the role of enslaver.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD64105P2'>Widows in both the North and South played outsized roles in commemorating the Civil War and deeply impacted the war's popular memory. Women were societally expected to remember their husbands as honorable, infusing that memory into the statuary and literature of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Antebellum social and legal practices also ensured that women were generally financially dependent upon their husbands, and widowhood thereby faced many women with poverty. Reform agencies therefore often targeted widows in their charitable work, and the widows themselves sought financial assistance from the federal government by applying for pensions, expanding the American welfare state. While widowhood existed prominently throughout the nineteenth century, the Civil War ultimately increased the number of widows and radically altered their places in American life (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P0'>In the nineteenth century, across the United States, women’s opportunities were limited. The vestiges of an element of English common law called coverture ensured women did not have a legal identity. Their fathers covered them until they married, at which point they fell under the legal identity of their husbands. In practice, this meant that women did not legally own property and did not even control their own children. They could not own businesses and could not bring suit to court. Rather, they had to rely on a husband, father, or other male relative. The concept of “Republican Motherhood,” however, ensured that some education was necessary. This ideal, which emerged after the American Revolution, held that mothers were central to raising virtuous boys who would one day shape the Republic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P1'>In the North, the Second Great Awakening and the rise of the middle class expanded women’s opportunities further. Heavily centered around the family, the middle class celebrated not an authoritative father but a loving mother. Separate spheres ideology held that men and women occupied different elements of society. Men were responsible for the public sphere, including politics and work outside of the home. Women took care of the domestic sphere, pushing temperance, self-control, hard work, honesty, and frugality. They had considerable power within this space, including nurturing children. Embracing these domestic ideals also pushed northern women into the public domain through such crusades as temperance and moral reform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P2'>In the agrarian South, patriarchy reigned supreme, where a male patriarchal “master” headed a family of dependents – women, children, and enslaved people, when financially possible. Here, men were virtually the law within the household. This hierarchy – and the dependent role women maintained – played a crucial role in uniting the South in its defense of slavery, for all white men were essentially “masters.” Operating with very little personal freedom, elite white women in the South also played a central role in managing the plantation household, overseeing large staffs of enslaved men and women within the domestic sphere. This expectation included embracing the violence that was necessary to maintaining the institution of slavery. Completely dependent on a male patriarch, women working outside of the home were limited to the occupations of the domestic realm, including working as a seamstress or milliner, teaching, domestic service, and sex work. Significantly lower paid than their male counterparts, these limitations ensured that poor white women often carried the burden of poverty in the South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P3'>The institution of slavery ensured that Black women faced still more limited circumstances. As chattel, they were defined by their productive capacity – their ability to produce in the field, the enslaver’s household, or reproductively. Subject to violence, rape, and the inability to control even their own children, enslaved women found ways to carve out elements of independency. Although enslavers sometimes forced enslaved men and women to engage in marital unions with spouses of the enslaver’s choosing, Black women often selected their own husbands, resisting the fact that these unions were only rarely enshrined in law and were subordinate to an enslaver’s desires. As far as was possible, these marriages followed the gendered division of labor typical throughout the U.S., where women were responsible for cooking, cleaning, and caring for children. Within these private households and the slave quarters more generally, enslaved women also engaged in the religions and cultural practices of their ancestry, including Caribbean and African influences.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P4'>The Civil War expanded women’s roles in society. Still within the realm of the domestic sphere, women in both regions formed Ladies Military Aid Societies, with an eye towards supporting soldiers. These groups sent domestic necessities, including clothing, socks, and bandages, and they eventually embraced nursing. In the South, societies even began making cartridges and preparing sandbags. Such work and the broader need for women to maintain the household without a male counterpart ensured that women took on new responsibilities, many of which pushed them deeper into the public sphere than was possible before the war. In the South, poor women even became active in demanding that the Confederacy support their families, even rioting publicly in places like Richmond. As many Black women escaped to the U.S. Army during the war, marriage often became their first goal, even forcing the federal government to implement new policies that protected and supported their families. They seized this opportunity to rebuild the families that had long-been severed by the institution of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32119115P5'>After the war, many of these expansions in women’s roles declined, but they did not disappear entirely. Northern women became active in providing support for veterans and their families, even helping navigating the pension system, while southern white women became active in burying the dead, memorialization, and the emergence of the Lost Cause mythology. This idea downplayed the role of slavery in the war and celebrated the Confederacy for its protection of families, within which, women were vital. Black women continued to lobby the U.S. government, including utilizing the Freedman’s Bureau to relocate members of their families and to solidify those unions. With intimate knowledge of the skills and length of individual tasks, they also played pivotal roles in negotiating the financial value of their labor and of negotiating the terms of free labor more generally. Nevertheless, the sexual victimization of Black women continued, becoming a prominent feature of the postwar South.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32034121P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines a veteran as "someone who has been in the armed forces during a war" (Cambridge Dictionary). The experiences of Civil War veterans varied as much as their combat experiences. Veterans of both the Union and Confederacy suffered debilitating injuries that plagued their postwar lives, while many others rose to economic and political prominence based on their wartime service. Veterans often joined veterans' associations like the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) for Union veterans or the United Confederate Veterans (UCV) for Confederate veterans to receive support, remain in community with those who shared their experiences, and to work for their respective communities. Many veterans, like those of other wars, suffered from mental illnesses based on their experiences, particularly what is now known as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Unfortunately, nineteenth-century medicine had not diagnosed this condition and thereby provided little support for sufferers. However, the federal government set up veterans' homes and a pension system in which veterans with disabilities caused by their wartime service could receive financial aid or a place to live. Veterans also played a crucial role in shaping Civil War memory through their participation in memorial parades and festivities, erection of commemorative statues, and contributions to literary and historical magazines and journals. Black Civil War veterans often experienced the postwar era differently. While nominally integrated, many GAR posts in the South were segregated, and the pension system frequently ignored or denied Black applicants. However, many Black veterans also received a greater degree of respect from both whites and Blacks in their communities and achieved greater financial success due to their service. While their experiences may have differed, veterans of the Civil War played an important role in the late-nineteenth century and in shaping how Americans perceived the war well into the twentieth (Essential Civil War Curriculum).

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.
