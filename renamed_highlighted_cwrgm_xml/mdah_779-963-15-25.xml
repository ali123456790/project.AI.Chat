                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS105350P0'>Ulysses S. Grant was a Union general during the Civil War and president of the United States during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P1'>Born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, Grant’s original name was Hiram Ulysses Grant. Hiram was an ode to his maternal grandfather, but Grant preferred his middle name Ulysses. He attended various private schools and then received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He was mistakenly enrolled under the name Ulysses S. Grant. Grant kept the moniker. Because it was often written as “U. S. Grant,” he gained the nickname “Uncle Sam,” or “Sam,” by fellow cadets.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P2'>Grant was an average student but excelled in horse riding. He graduated in 1843 and was commissioned as an officer in the Fourth Infantry Regiment in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1844, he met Julia Dent, the sister of a West Point classmate and soon became engaged, before he was moved to a new post. From 1846 to 1848, Grant served in the Mexican-American War seeing action in many different battles and receiving two brevet (honorary) promotions for bravery. Upon returning from the war, in 1848, Grant married Julia. The couple eventually had four children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P3'>After the Mexican-American War, Grant carried out various army assignments, including some in California and the far west. He generally performed well, and was recognized as being a caring and considerate officer. However, in 1854, Grant began to show problems with alcohol, and after warnings by his superior officer, he resigned his military commission in July that year. He returned to his wife in St. Louis, unemployed and with little money. For the next several years, Grant struggled to make money to support his growing family. He tried and failed at farming, real estate sales, and local government service. His father-in-law gifted him a slave, a 35-year old farmhand named William Jones. Despite Grant’s financial despair, he chose to free Jones in 1859, rather than use him for labor or profit from his sale. Grant instead sold personal items, like a gold watch and at one point sold firewood on street corners in St. Louis. Finally, in 1860, he joined his father’s successful leather goods business, operated by his younger brothers in Galena, Illinois, and became financially stable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P4'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Grant volunteered for military service. With his military background, he was made colonel of the Twenty-first Illinois Infantry Regiment, and by July 1861 had been promoted to brigadier general. Showing great aptitude within the rapidly growing Union Army, Grant received another promotion in September 1861 as commander of the District of Southeast Missouri.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P5'>Grant fought his first major battle at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861. While largely a draw, it gave Grant valuable field command experience. Only three months later, he carried out a highly successful campaign against Confederate troops at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. His capture of both positions led to northern newspapers calling him “Unconditional Surrender” Grant and elevated his status in the Union, during a time when other federal armies had faced several defeats.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P6'>Grant was nearly defeated by a large Confederate army in southwestern Tennessee in April 1862, but rallied his force and counterattacked the next day, winning the Battle of Shiloh. The casualty rate shocked many in the north, but President Abraham Lincoln recognized that Grant did not quit in the face of adversity or hardship and endorsed him for higher command. In late 1862 and into 1863, Grant carried out an effort to capture Vicksburg, Mississippi, and help secure the Mississippi River for Union forces. Hindered by Confederate forces, terrain, and the elements, Grant’s army suffered through a long and tiring campaign. Yet, his tenacity and creativity, backed by a superior number of soldiers and competent subordinates like William Tecumseh Sherman, ensured victory. Grant outmaneuvered his opponents, raided Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson, and then besieged a Confederate army in Vicksburg, capturing the city on July 4, 1863, and electrifying northern morale—especially as it occurred a day after a separate Union army defeated Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P7'>Grant followed his success in Mississippi by defeating Confederate forces that had surrounded a Union army in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in 1864 was promoted to lieutenant general and made general-in-chief of the United States Army. He relocated to Virginia and over the next year carried out a bloody advance on the Confederate capital of Richmond. While Robert E. Lee effectively blocked Grant’s initial assaults in northern Virginia, Grant proved undaunted by battlefield defeats. He understood that Union armies could replenish the loss of men and supplies more easily than the Confederacy, and that each massive engagement wore down the Army of Northern Virginia. Indeed, Lee did his best to hold back Grant’s massive army, but in 1865, after months of grueling fighting, and a long siege of Petersburg, the Confederate army was forced to abandon Richmond and retreat to the southwest. Grant’s army cut off Lee’s army, forcing the south’s most famous general to surrender in April 1865 at Appomattox Court House. While several other Confederate armies across the south did not surrender until days or weeks later, Grant’s victory in Virginia effectively signaled the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P8'>Grant remained in the army immediately after the war, working closely with President Andrew Johnson after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination. However, Grant soon split from Johnson on Reconstruction and other policy matters. He was nominated by the Republican Party for president in 1868 and won, entering the White House in 1869. Grant was an honest and empathetic leader, but his administration was marred by corruption. Those controversies overshadowed some of his successes as the nation’s chief executive including greater protections for Black southerners during Reconstruction, signing the Fifteenth Amendment (which protected African American voting rights), greater protection of Native American lands, establishing Yellowstone as a national park, and advocating for civil service reform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P9'>After serving two terms as president, Grant and his wife went on a two-year world tour. The couple settled in New York City afterwards, when Grant again suffered financial loss due to an investment scam. He developed throat cancer and spent his final months writing his personal memoir. Grant finished writing only a few days before passing away, on July 23, 1885. His memoir was a financial success, providing his widow a large amount of money for retirement, and is largely recognized as one of the best autobiographies in the English language. Grant is buried in the General Grant National Memorial (also known as Grant’s Tomb) in New York City, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS56834P0'>Edwin McMasters Stanton was an attorney and politician who served as the U.S. secretary of war during the Civil War and Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P1'>Born on December 19, 1814, in Steubenville, Ohio, Stanton was educated at various private schools and academies, and attended Kenyon College before leaving due to lack of money. He developed an opposition to slavery at a young age, but also became a strong supporter of southerner Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. Stanton began pursuing a career in law shortly after leaving college and studied under an attorney in Steubenville. He became a practicing attorney in 1835 and joined a prominent law firm in Cadiz, Ohio, becoming one its primary trial lawyers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P2'>In 1838, one of Stanton’s law partners—Benjamin Tappan—won election to the U.S. Senate. Stanton oversaw the law firm in Tappan’s absence and became more active in politics in his own right. He gained fame in 1845 from his defense of Caleb McNulty, a Democrat and clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, who had been charged with embezzling tens of thousands of dollars. Stanton successfully got the charges dropped through the clever use of legal technicalities. Wide newspaper reporting of the proceedings broadcast Stanton’s name across a wide area.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P3'>When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Stanton considered enlisting in the military. However, he was a lifelong sufferer of asthma, and physicians warned him that such action could prove detrimental to his health or life. Instead, he expanded his legal practice into Virginia and Pennsylvania, and established a new office in Pittsburgh. His prominence as an attorney spread, in part due to his role in arguing cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1857, the U.S. attorney general asked Stanton to represent the U.S. government during a dispute over land claims in California. After a lengthy journey by ship, he spent months investigating documents in California and successfully proved that several claims by foreign parties were fraudulent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P4'>During the 1860 presidential election, Stanton publicly chose to support the southern Democratic candidate, John C. Breckinridge, over the national Democratic candidate (and northerner) Stephen Douglas. The decision was partly based upon his belief that Breckinridge’s victory would prevent southern secession, but Douglas and Stanton had also been at odds over political matters in the past. When Abraham Lincoln won the election, and southern states began declaring secession, outgoing president James Buchanan appointed Stanton U.S. attorney general. The appointment took place in December 1860, and only lasted until Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861, but it allowed Stanton to be directly involved in trying to prevent the country from breaking apart.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P5'>Stanton strongly opposed secession, and he believed Buchanan was too compliant to southern demands. He and Secretary of State Jeremiah Black advised against withdrawing federal soldiers from Fort Sumter in South Carolina, threatening to resign their posts if the president made such decision. The effort worked, and Buchanan agreed to stand firm on the U.S. Army’s hold on the fort in Charleston Harbor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P6'>When Lincoln was inaugurated, Stanton was replaced as attorney general. He remained in Washington, D.C., to help the new cabinet transition, and he made a good impression on some of the incoming secretaries. When Lincoln’s original secretary of war, Simon Cameron, resigned in late 1861, the Secretary of State William H. Seward and Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase recommended Stanton as the replacement. Lincoln agreed, and on January 15, 1862, Stanton was sworn in as the U.S. secretary of war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P7'>Stanton proved to be a very effective administrator as secretary of war. He oversaw the massive increase in the Union army, and a war effort that spanned from Kansas to Washington, D.C., and then into the Confederacy, over four years of bloody fighting. This involved improving communication and transportation networks, and maintaining determination in the face of several Union battlefield defeats. Although Stanton did not have a high reputation of Lincoln at first, the secretary of war became one of the president’s fiercest and most loyal defenders as the war progressed. Although intending to retire from the cabinet at the end of the war, Lincoln’s assassination sparked an intense energy in Stanton, and he practically took control of the Republican administration. He oversaw the federal effort to capture and punish the people involved in Lincoln’s assassination, and took a hardline position on punishing the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P8'>When Vice President Andrew Johnson was sworn in as president, following Lincoln’s death, he and Stanton established an uneasy relationship. Soon, they clashed over Reconstruction policies. Johnson took a more lenient approach to former Confederates while Stanton wanted federal occupation to oversee much of the rebuilding and restructuring of southern society. By late 1867, the rift led the president to remove Stanton from his cabinet position. Republicans in Congress backed Stanton, and in January 1868 the U.S. Senate reinstated him as secretary of war. Johnson continued his efforts to remove Stanton, leading to Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives moving to impeach Johnson. The president barely survived the impeachment conviction in the U.S. Senate, but his political power within the Republican Party was essentially over.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P9'>Stanton resigned from his position as secretary of war in May 1868. He returned to practicing law but did provide some public support for Republican candidates, including Ulysses S. Grant’s run for president, in the election that year. In late 1869, Grant offered him an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. He accepted and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on December 20. However, Stanton—whose health was already failing—died before he could take his seat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS56834P10'>Stanton was married twice, first to Mary Lamson, who died in 1844. His second wife was Ellen Hutchison. He had at least seven children. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
