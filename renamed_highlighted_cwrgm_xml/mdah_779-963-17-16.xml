                    <p xml:id='OTPS32075550P0'>Josiah Abigail Patterson Campbell was a politician, attorney, and chief justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32075550P1'>Born on March 2, 1830, in Lancaster District, South Carolina, Campbell attended Davidson College in North Carolina and then moved to Madison County, Mississippi, around 1845. Highly intelligent, he studied law and became the youngest practicing attorney in Mississippi at the age of 17, in 1847. His legal practice thrived and he entered politics in 1851. Campbell won election to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1851 and 1859, and served as the speaker of the house in 1859 and 1860.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32075550P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Campbell served in the Provisional Confederate Congress and was one of the original signers of the Confederate Constitution. He then volunteered for military service, was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Fortieth Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and was wounded in the Second Battle of Corinth.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32075550P3'>Following the Civil War, Campbell was elected a circuit judge, but was ejected from office by federal authorities in 1868 after refusing to swear allegiance to the United States. He strongly opposed Republican Reconstruction, and played an active part in the Mississippi Plan, which involved the use of political pressure and violence against Republicans and African Americans to reestablish conservative white, Democratic control of Mississippi. He also participated in framing the Mississippi legal codes of 1871 and 1880.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32075550P4'>Campbell received an appointment to the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1876 and served until 1894. He was chief justice during his last three years on the court. Campbell also participated in the drafting of Mississippi’s 1890 constitution, which dismantled some of Reconstruction policies and strengthened white supremacy in the state. After leaving the Mississippi Supreme Court, Campbell returned to private law practice. He died on January 10, 1917. He was married to Eugenia Nash and had at least four children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD52163P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses advanced dramatically, though by 1900 it certainly still had far to go. In colonial America, mental illnesses were largely perceived as acts of God and thus inescapable and incurable. American society therefore dealt with people suffering from mental illnesses primarily through charitable organizations or benevolent societies like churches or almshouses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P1'>Throughout the nineteenth century, however, as the ideals of the Enlightenment continued to evolve, Americans developed a more institutional, scientific approach to understanding and treating mental illnesses as curable and in turn developing the field of psychiatry. Psychiatrists and state governments founded state-funded asylums to study and treat people with mental illnesses in isolation to prevent both interruption of treatment and danger to society. While nineteenth-century psychiatrists employed many terms no longer accepted to describe mental illnesses, and while the methods they employed in their asylums have likewise been largely dismissed, the study and treatment of mental illness in the United States advanced rapidly in the nineteenth century in tandem with greater societal and educational reforms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P2'>It is critical to note, however, that much of this advancement was aided by slavery. The Eastern Lunatic Asylum of Virginia, for example, relied on enslaved people as both patients and caregivers, and ideas about blackness and insanity were often mutually dependent. (Wendy Gonaver, The Peculiar Institution and the Making of Modern Psychiatry, 1840–1880).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P3'>One notable, and widespread, mental illness afflicting Americans in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries was the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) experienced by many Civil War veterans. While psychiatry had evolved over the century, its failure to diagnose and treat widespread PTSD glaringly reveals its limits (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 283-285).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD93422P0'>Suicide is the intentional act of killing oneself. Examples of suicide can be found throughout world history, most often associated to desperate situations, such as warriors choosing to die by their own hands rather than face capture. However, in western culture, and in American history in particular, suicide was often seen as an act of despair or insanity. During the nineteenth century, some Americans saw suicide as a great moral crime, deserving punishment. Should a person’s death be ruled a suicide, these people advocated that the deceased person’s property should be confiscated by the state rather than passed to the heirs. Such advocates believed this punishment would deter other suicides. Other nineteenth century Americans began looking for scientific or medical reasons for suicides. They believed the act was one of psychological distress or depression.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93422P1'>The frequency of suicide in nineteenth century America is hard to determine, due to incomplete information. However, some states, such as Massachusetts, began tracking basic information about suicides as early as the 1840s. In the last half of the 1850s, Massachusetts averaged 95 suicides per year. During the Civil War years of 1861 to 1865, civilian suicides actually dropped in Massachusetts to 79 per year. The number then increased after the war, reaching 126 per year by 1870. The statistics also revealed that men committed suicide three times more often than women.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93422P2'>Union military medical reports provide some statistics regarding suicide among soldiers during the Civil War. (Unfortunately, no such data exists for Confederate forces.) One study noted 268 suicides in the Union Army between June 1861 and August 1865, for an average of 5.25 incidents per month. In reality, suicides did not occur at an even pace. Federal surgeons recorded a spike in suicides between October 1862 and September 1863, then another increase from March to August 1864, and then a sudden surge during the final weeks of the Civil War in 1865. Relatively few details exist regarding these incidents. Anecdotal evidence reveals that the act was carried out by both enlisted men and officers. Some individuals had expressed despondency or desperation, others provided no warning. Those recorded by Union medical officials almost exclusively occurred in camp or within Union lines. The statistics did not cover soldiers who committed suicide in combat or other hostile situations. For instance, an unknown number of men chose suicide while suffering in the horrible conditions of a Civil War prisoner of war camp. Former prisoners at places like Andersonville recalled stories of men intentionally walking across the “dead line”—a perimeter marker near the prison wall that was off-limits with a penalty of death—to be shot by the guards.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93422P3'>The increase of suicide rates in the United States after the Civil War led to greater public attention to the issue. Alcohol became one popular explanation for suicides, although the actual role liquor played in suicide is not clear. Commentators also noted that people who carried out suicide often experienced financial hardships or some other social difficulty, such as romantic loss or interpersonal conflict. Americans in the nineteenth century did not directly tie psychological trauma from battle, now recognized as post-traumatic stress, to suicides, but prior military service often appeared as part of the victim’s personal history.

Gregory Lande, “Felo De Se: Soldier Suicides in America’s Civil War,” <hi rend='italic'> Military Medicine</hi>, 531–536; Kathleen Logothetis Thompson, “Suicide and the Civil War,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Fortunately I have and have had for years an influence over him that is superior to that of a good parent over an obedient child and after the frenzied burst of passion had sufficiently subsided and his <rs ref='#S32020596'>wife</rs> and other friends that were present had retired I attempted and did in the course of two hours quiet his feelings and restore him to composure and have partially reestablished hope of pardon, (for I think it is best to Keep that hope alive if posable) I visited him often from necessity—he is sometimes in a fine state of mind and hopeful, at other times his state is bad—he desponding and desiring to be out of the way and released from trouble, rises expressions into acts that are not entertaining or arguable, if he is necessarily as <rs ref='#S32021053'>sentenced</rs> by ^<rs ref='#S63440'>Court</rs>^ <rs ref='#S94074'>Kept</rs> in <rs ref='#S62926'>jail</rs> during this summer I think he will not be worth <rs ref='#S32019844'>Turning out</rs>, if he should survive the term of his imprisonment.
