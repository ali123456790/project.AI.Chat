                    <p xml:id='OTPS25009574P0'>Norvin Green was a physician and businessman, most notably associated as a leading executive of Western Union in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P1'>Born in New Albany, Indiana, on April 17, 1818, Green moved to Kentucky as a child and gained experience working on the Ohio River as a young man. He financed his own education at the University of Louisville, receiving a degree in medicine in 1840. Green also married Martha English of Kentucky in 1840. The couple had five children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25009574P2'>Green practiced medicine in Louisville during the 1840s before getting into local politics. In 1850, he won an election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served in office until 1853. Upon leaving office, Green received an appointment to oversee construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville. Perhaps because of this project, he took a strong interest telegraphy. He started the Southwestern Telegraph Company to connect Louisville to New Orleans, and in 1857 moved to New York to expand his career in telegraph development. Over the next nine years, Green helped bring together various small telegraph companies to form Western Union in 1866. He initially served as vice president of the new corporation, rising to president in 1878 (upon the death of William Orton). Green also formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell in 1884. Attesting to his status among these powerful figures, Green was elected the institute’s first president.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

<p xml:id='OTPS25002458P1'>Born on April 5, 1839, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Kennard graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1861, at the start of the Civil War. He immediately resigned from the U.S. Army and volunteered for Confederate service. During his travel south from New York, he received a commission in the Confederate army and sent to the Army of Tennessee, where he was made chief of ordnance. He achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel and oversaw Confederate ordnance supply issues (artillery, weapons, ammunition, gun powder, etc.) in the western theater for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25002458P2'>After the end of the Civil War, Kennard briefly served as adjutant general of the Mississippi militia before moving to St. Louis, Missouri, to work as an editor in a newspaper.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73473P0'>Clubs and secret societies have been common throughout American history. Clubs are often small, localized groups formed openly by people who wish to enjoy or promote a common interest or cause, such as sports, hobbies, or politics. However, clubs are often associated with recreational interests. Secret societies, on the other hand, are organizations that keep their purpose, members, and activities concealed from outsiders. Some hide their very existence from the public, while others keep only their inner workings masked to retain a feeling of exclusivity or mystery for their members. Truly secret societies often exist for political reasons, where members wish to advocate or influence events covertly. Such organizations are often viewed with suspicion, and many conspiracy theories involve accusations of secret societies manipulating events for a sinister agenda.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73473P1'>Clubs and secretive organizations were very popular during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Fraternal groups, such as the Freemasons and Odd Fellows, which were well-known but had secret rituals and exclusive membership, thrived. Many such groups professed dedication to morality and ethical living, or supported charitable cause. However, members were often drawn to those organizations for the social bonds and camaraderie. The popularity of these organizations frequently led to their expansion to other cities, states, or even countries. Due to limited methods of communication before the twentieth century, local chapters or lodges often remained fairly independent from each other. Additionally, regional interests or differences occasionally caused divisions within national or international clubs and societies. For instance, disputes about slavery in the nineteenth century caused a rift between British and American members of the Independent Order of Good Templars.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73473P2'>Clubs and secret societies continue to exist in the twenty-first century. Unlike earlier groups, though, many modern organizations exist primarily online and rely upon membership outside their local communities. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99805P0'>Freemasons, or Masons, are members of a fraternal organization movement dating back to the stonemasons of the fourteenth century. The Masons are secretive and the development of their practices and organizational structure since the 1400s is unclear, even within Masonic circles. Members belong to Masonic Lodges, many of which rose semi-independently, and involve rituals and passwords known only to members.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99805P1'>Masons from separate lodges in London established the first Grand Lodge in 1717 as an effort to codify and regulate elements of Freemasonry. Over the next several decades, Freemasonry became popular in England, leading to more involvement by wealthy and aristocratic individuals, and shifting Freemasonry away from its working class origins. The first Freemasons in North America established a lodge in Pennsylvania around 1731. New lodges emerged across the English colonies, and several prominent colonial figures, including George Washington, became Masons. Following American independent, separate Grand Lodges formed in each state. Despite some efforts to unite them under a single United States Grand Lodge, the state lodges remained nominally independent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99805P2'>While Freemasonry has some association with Enlightenment thinking and advocacy during the eighteenth century, Masons did not cohesively endorse any political ideas or social movements. This allowed Masons to help each other even when on opposing sides of military or political conflicts. During the Civil War, there were numerous instances in which soldiers, upon being attacked or captured by enemy forces, provided Masonic signals or statements and received protection from Masons on the other side.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99805P3'>The secretive nature and adoption of rituals led to some criticism of Masons. Some religious leaders accused Freemasonry of being associated with the occult, or saw it as a competitor for Christian teachings. Other critics feared that Masons conspired for power and used their secretive membership to influence governments behind the scenes. Nevertheless, Freemasonry continued to flourish and is still present in the twenty-first century. (Wikipedia; Michael A. Halleran, <hi rend='italic'>The Better Angels of our Nature: Freemasonry in the American Civil War</hi>, 78–86)
