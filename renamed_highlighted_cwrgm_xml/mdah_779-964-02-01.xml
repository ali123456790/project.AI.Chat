                    <p xml:id='OTPS32030164P0'>Thomas John Wood was a Union general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P1'>Born on September 25, 1823, in Munfordville, Kentucky, Wood graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1845. He briefly served as a staff officer to General Zachary Taylor during the Mexican-American War before requesting a combat assignment with the U.S. Second Dragoons (a cavalry unit) and serving with distinction at the Battle of Buena Vista in 1847. After the conflict with Mexico ended, Wood remained in service with the U.S. cavalry, serving at various outposts in the west. In 1859 he took a leave of absence from the army and traveled to Europe, returning in 1861 during the secession crisis and outbreak of the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P2'>Back in the United States in 1861, Wood helped raise several regiments in Indiana. He received a promotion in the Union army to brigadier general in October 1861, and commanded a brigade during Union campaigns in Tennessee and Mississippi. He later received command of a division, leading troops at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and at the Battle of Murfreesboro, from December 31, 1862 to January 3, 1863. During the Battle of Chickamauga in Georgia in September 1863, Wood received a surprising tactical order from the Union commander, General William S. Rosecrans, which instructed him to move his division out of position. The maneuver, which was based upon Rosecrans’ confusion of troop positions, would create a large gap in the Union line. Having been criticized by Rosecrans before for not immediately obeying directives, Wood followed the order exactly as written. A short time later, Confederate soldiers flooded into the hole left by Wood’s division and split the Union army, contributing to the federal defeat in the battle. Wood was among those blamed for the loss at Chickamauga.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P3'>Wood performed very well in subsequent battles, including Missionary Ridge in Tennessee in November 1863 and at Lovejoy’s Station in Georgia in August 1864, helping him earn higher command. Despite a severe wound to the leg at Lovejoy’s Station, Wood returned to the field only weeks later and led an army corps during the Battle of Nashville in December 1864 and received promotion to major general in early 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P4'>Following the Civil War, Wood received orders to Mississippi for occupation duties. He served there until 1868, overseeing various Reconstruction activities, then retired from the army and moved to Dayton, Ohio.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32030164P5'>Wood died on February 26, 1906, in Dayton. He had been married to Caroline Elizabeth Greer since 1861, and had three children. Wood is buried in the United States Military Academy Post Cemetery at West Point, New York.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32022430P0'>William R. Barksdale was a Confederate officer and member of Mississippi’s House of Representatives during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022430P1'>Born in Lauderdale County, Alabama, on April 26, 1834, Barksdale moved to Mississippi with his parents as a child. He graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1851, taught at the university for a few years, and then received a law degree there in 1859. Barksdale shortly afterwards began practicing law in Yalobusha County, Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022430P2'>Following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860, Barksdale was elected as a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in January 1861. He volunteered for military service during the Civil War, and served as an assistant adjutant general in the Confederate army for most of his time in uniform. He was severely wounded at the Battle of Franklin, Tennessee, in November 1864, and was medically discharged from the army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022430P3'>Barksdale returned to his home in Mississippi and resumed his legal practice in 1865. Shortly afterwards, he became a district attorney. The position helped establish his public standing, and in 1875 he won a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives. Barksdale served less than two years before he died of pneumonia on January 10, 1877, at the age of 42. He is buried at Odd Fellow Cemetery in Grenada, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32099145P0'>A bar association is a professional association of attorneys, often responsible for regulating the legal practices and standards in their communities. The use of the word “bar” is tied to the traditional presence of a railing in court room to separate court proceeding from the public viewing area. In the United States, bar association requirements vary. Most are now organized as corporations. Many states require lawyers to be members of a respective bar association to practice law. Attorneys typically must pass bar exams to demonstrate proficiency in their state’s laws, regulations, and legal practices for admission to a bar association. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

<p corresp='TTP34012106P6' xml:id='OTP34012106P6'>I have read Mr. Barksdales ^letters^ with great care, and fully appreciate the points he makes in regard to the difficulty of using the affidavit of <rs ref='#S32136607'>Woodruff</rs> in processing the issuance of a warrent for the <rs ref='#S62954'>arrest</rs> of the parties therein implicated. The truth is, I thought, when the affidavit was made, it should be taken before a magistrate of this state, but yielded my opinion in deference to Mr. <rs ref='#S32139435'>Adam<add place='above'>s</add></rs> statement, who said an affidavit taken before

          <p corresp='TTP34012107P0' xml:id='OTP34012107P0'>him as a Commissioner of the <rs ref='#S32078493'>U. S. District court</rs> would answer every purpose that could be affected by an affidavit taken before a state magistrate. Mr. Adam is a prac=ticing lawyer of this <rs ref='#S32099145'>bar</rs>; and when <hi rend='underline'>[directors?]</hi> gives an opinion, lawyers must yield.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP34012107P1' xml:id='OTP34012107P1'>What then is the remedy for this mistake? Clearly it is to send to <rs ref='#S63295'>Kentucky</rs> for Woodruff, <rs ref='#S32031715'>bring him hither</rs>, and have his affidavit taken before a magistrate of this state. But I have considerable doubt whether the ends of justice would be [?], by bringing the <rs ref='#S94074'>criminals</rs> to <del rend='overstrike'>justice</del> punishment, by bringing Woodruff hither. I will give your Excellency my reasons for this doubt, with a mind to eliciting your opinion, and, if possible, settling upon a course of action which will result in the punishment of such atrocious <rs ref='#S63926'>mur-derers</rs> as <rs ref='#S32102704'>Wilson</rs> and <rs ref='#S32139436'>Bill Forrest</rs>. I will consider the case of Forrest first. According to Woodruff's affidavit
</p>

<p corresp='TTP34012107P2' xml:id='OTP34012107P2'>all the evidence he could give against Forrest would be simply heresay, which of course would go for just nothing in a criminal prosecution. I have very little doubt that Forrest <rs ref='#S63262'>murdered</rs> the two traders in <rs ref='#S63123'>Grenada</rs> last spring, yet I doubt whether any=thing could be done toward the legal establishment of the facts by Wood=ruff<add place='above'>s</add> testimony.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP34012107P3' xml:id='OTP34012107P3'>In regard to Wilson<add place='above'>s</add> case I will remark first, that Mr Barksdale is of the opinion he has left the state, but does not express an opinion as to where has gone, so that a requisi=tion could be made by your Excellency for him. First this investigation might throw light on this point, and fur=nish sufficient data for you to act on. But I fear this is not the least difficulty in <rs ref='#S71046'>convicting</rs> Wilson of the <rs ref='#S53668'>assassination</rs> of Lieut. <rs ref='#S32128729'>Blanding</rs>.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP34012107P4' xml:id='OTP34012107P4'>That he is ^the^ author of that odious crime I have not a particle of doubt. But the question is, can he be convicted? Let it be suppposed that he has been arrested, <rs ref='#S95194'>indicted</rs>

The probability is that the evidence of Woodruff would have mainly to be relied on by the prosecution for a conviction. Suppose he should <del rend='overstrike'>[?]</del> swear most positively to the commission of the crime by Wilson; would not his evidence be confronted on the part of the [?] by his contradicting statements, made under oath, before the Grand jury which has already investigated this matter. I am not a lawyer, but I [apprehend?] the effect of showing such a contradiction in the evidence of Woodruff on the two occasions would be to put him before the petit jury as a witness discredited by his own sworn statements.
