                    <p xml:id='OTPS32081537P0'>Joshua Gabriel Baker was a lawyer, Unionist, and Governor Louisiana in 1868.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32081537P1'>Born on March 23, 1799 in Mason County, Kentucky, as a child Baker relocated with his family to the sugar plantation Oaklawn in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana by 1811. In 1819, he graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the artillery corps. He served as an assistant professor of engineering at West Point until resigning in October 1820.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32081537P2'>Afterwards, Baker moved to Litchfield, Connecticut, where he studied law and became a lawyer in Mason County, Kentucky the following year. He relocated again to Opelousas, Louisiana, where he joined the law firm of John Bronson from 1822 to 1829 and 1832-1838. He was also a colonel in the state militia from 1826 to 1829.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32081537P3'>In 1839, Baker became involved in Lousiana politics. He served as a judge in St. Mary's Parish from 1829 to 1839, as the Assistant State Engineer from 1833 to 1838, and as the Director of Public Works from 1840 to 1845. From 1846 to 1851, he was also a captain in the state cavalry militia. Throughout this period, Baker owned three plantations and was the enslaver of at least fifty-six men, women, and children by 1850.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32081537P4'>Baker was a conservative Democrat who opposed secession and refused to assist the Confederacy. During the Civil War, he settled in Franklin, Louisiana and assisted the U.S. Army during its occupation of Louisiana.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32081537P5'>On January 8, 1868, Baker took the Oath of Loyalty to the Union and was appointed Military Governor of Louisiana. He supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction plans but had little power due to the U.S. military. He resigned on June 27, 1868 and returned to his plantation and his law practice.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32081537P6'>Baker married twice. His first wife was Fanny Assherton (Stelle) Baker, with whom he had three children. She died on August 17, 1831. The following year, he married Catherine (Patton) Baker, who also preceded him in death. The pair had two children. Of his five children, only one daughter lived to adulthood. Joshua Gabriel Baker died in his daughter's home in Lyme, Connecticut on April 16, 1885 and was buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Greenwood Heights, King County, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25011749P0'>A power of attorney is "the legal right to act for someone else in their financial or business matters, or the document that gives you this right" (Cambridge Dictionary). Power of attorney can be granted for numerous and varied reasons, generally to those whose relatives or legal dependents are deemed incapable of managing their own affairs due to disability, age, or other factors. Power of attorney privileges in the nineteenth-century United States most often had negative effects on women. American law placed men at the head of their households, and at marriage a woman's political and legal identity  was subsumed into her husband's in a process known as "coverture." While not technically a power of attorney agreement, this arrangement provided the same practical powers and granted men full control of their wives' property, finances, and often, in the case of divorce, custody of children. Powers of attorney in the nineteenth-century U. S. therefore highlight the level of legally protected patriarchal authority exercised by men North and South (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol.1, 533-537).
