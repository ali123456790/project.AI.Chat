                    <p xml:id='OTPS32122414P0'>Irvin McDowell was a U.S. Army officer who served as a Union general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32122414P1'>Born on October 15, 1818, in Columbus, Ohio, McDowell was partly educated in France before graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1838. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army and served in the First U.S. Artillery. Among McDowell’s military assignments was an instructor of tactics at West Point, before he served on the staff of General John Wool during the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s. He received the brevet (honorary) rank of captain following the Battle of Buena Vista. Following the war, McDowell remained in the U.S. Army and served in the adjutant general’s department, where he worked closely with several officers who would become notable figures in the Civil War, including future Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32122414P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, McDowell was rapidly promoted from major to brigadier general. Although most of his military career had been as a staff officer, he received command of the Army of Northeastern Virginia in May 1861 with expectations of leading it against Confederate soldiers defending the the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. Feeling pressure from President Abraham Lincoln's administration, McDowell led his army in an attack against Confederate troops near the town of Manassas, Virginia, in July 1861. The subsequent battle—known as the First Battle of Bull Run, or the Battle of Manassas—began well for McDowell’s Union troops, but turned into a staggering defeat after Confederate reinforcements counterattacked late in the day. McDowell was relieved of command of the army and was given a division in the new Army of the Potomac under General George B. McClellan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32122414P3'>McDowell continued to lead Union soldiers in Virginia for the next year, receiving the promotion to major general of volunteers and command of a corps. He performed well at the Battle of Cedar Mountain in western Virginia, but was heavily criticized for the Union defeat at the Battle of Second Bull Run in August 1862. After sitting without command for nearly two years, McDowell was sent out west to take charge of the Department of the Pacific in 1864. He remained on the Pacific coast after the Civil War ended, heading the Department of California from 1865 to 1867. His postwar career went well, and he received the rank of major general in the regular U.S. Army, leading various military departments in the east in the late 1860s and through the 1870s. Among these assignments was a four year period, from 1872 to 1876, as commander of the Military Division of the South. He returned to the west coast in 1876 to lead the Division of the Pacific until he left the army in 1882.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32122414P4'>McDowell lived in San Francisco, California, following his retirement. He died of a heart attack on May 4, 1885. He was married to Helen Burden and had at least five children. He is buried in San Francisco National Cemetery in San Francisco, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

The cause, participants, and size of an effort to overthrow authority can vary. However, political and military officials typically respond to insurrections with legal and military force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P1'>The United States Constitution refers to insurrection in Article 1, Section 8, where it authorizes Congress to “provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.” Southern secession activities were not called insurrectionary until Confederates fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, turning the tense political debate over the legality of unilateral state secession into open warfare. At that point, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to enforce federal authority in the South and described the seceded states as engaging in insurrection. The term carries important legal connotations. International law does not recognize insurrectionists as legal combatants in war. By late 1861, Lincoln preferred to describe the South as in a state of “rebellion” instead of insurrection—a term with the same technical meaning, but which more strongly characterized the Confederacy as engaging in an unjust resistance to authority.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P2'>Confederates also feared political insurrection within the South during Civil War. Support for secession was not universal through the Southern states, and numerous communities—particularly in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, northern Alabama, and most famously western Virginia (which actually separated and created its own state of West Virginia in 1863)—harbored pro-Union sentiments. Confederate and secessionist state officials frequently described anti-Confederate resistance within these communities and other parts of the South as insurrectionary. They used state and Confederate military forces to suppress such opposition.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD86078P3'>Nineteenth century Southerners most commonly used the term insurrection to describe physical resistance by slaves against their masters. When the Union Army began to employ African American soldiers in 1863, the Confederate government announced that white Union officers captured while commanding black soldiers would be executed for inciting “servile insurrection.” The Confederacy backed down from that threat when Lincoln’s administration responded that it would execute one Confederate prisoner for each Union soldier killed, but the policy reflected the long-standing Southern fear of slave insurrections or rebellions. Before, during, and even after the Civil War, white Southern officials called out local militias—or even unregulated groups of armed men—to reestablish authority over African Americans suspected or accused of insurrection, often with overly violent methods.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32118119P0'>On May 29, 1865, President Andrew Johnson issued his “Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction” to outline his policy for former Confederates to regain their rights and property within the United States. It was a broad and lenient approach to reconstruction, more in line with his predecessor Abraham Lincoln’s desire for reconciliation than the Radical Republicans’ desire for punishment. It required ex-Confederates to swear an oath to protect and defend the United States and its Constitution, and to recognize the emancipation laws and proclamations issued during the war. However, Johnson’s amnesty proclamation excluded fourteen classes of individuals. Among these categories were former Confederate civil and diplomatic officials, former Confederate army officers above the rank of colonel and former Confederate naval officers above the rank of lieutenant, former United States judges and Congressional members who joined the Confederacy, military personnel who left the U.S. military to serve the Confederacy, people within Union areas who traveled to the Confederacy during the Civil War to aid secessionists, and individuals who aided the Confederacy and owned taxable property over $20,000. Individuals who fell into those exempted categories were required to apply to Johnson for a special pardon. By June 5, 1866, Johnson had pardoned 12,652 individuals in those categories. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32021662P0'>The United States Congress Third Reconstruction Act (1867), enacted in March of 1867, outlined terms for Confederate states' re-admittance to the Union by enacting the laws stated in the 14th Amendment. This was the third in a set of four Reconstruction Acts passed concerning the reentry of insurgent states following the Civil War and required each state reentering the Union to write a new constitution that guaranteed African American men the right to vote and hold office. It also mandated the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which guaranteed citizenship rights to all people born or naturalized in the United States and prohibited states from denying any person the equal protection of the laws. Many white southerners opposed the act, viewing it as an infringement on states' rights, but by 1870, all former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union under new Republican governments as outlined through this act.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

It encompassed the states of Arkansas and Mississippi with its headquarters at Vicksburg, Mississippi under the command of Maj. Gen. Edward O. C. Ord. It was later commanded by Maj. Gens. Alvan C. Gillem, Irvin McDowell, and Adelbert Ames. It was one of five military districts that placed ten of the former Confederate states under military authority. Its function was to protect the rights of freedmen, keep the peace, and oversee the election and formation of new state governments in Arkansas and Mississippi loyal to the federal government in Washington D. C. During its existence it combated the rampant post-war racial and political violence experienced throughout the South during that time. Arkansas ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and adopted a new state constitution in the spring of 1868 and on June 22, 1868 was readmitted to the Union, leaving Mississippi the sole state of the district. It disbanded when Mississippi returned to civil government and was readmitted to the Union on February 23, 1870.

The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63972P0'>Operating at the national level, the United States Congress was founded in 1789 as a part of the legislative branch of the nation's federal government. It is comprised of the Senate and the House of Representatives, both of whom are responsible for creating and passing bills and convene at the State's Capitol located in Washington, D.C. Members can be elected to serve repeatedly and must be at least twenty-five years of age for the House of Representatives and at least thirty for the Senate. They must also reside in the state in which they represent and have United States Citizenship for at least seven years for the House of Representatives or nine years for the Senate. (Wikipedia)

</p>

<p corresp='TTP32046300P4' xml:id='OTP32046300P4'>(2) The <rs ref='#S32021662'>act</rs> of July 19" 1867 Section 7 provides that "No "person shall at any time "be entitled to be registered "or to vote by any executive "<rs ref='#S62927'>pardon</rs> or amnesty for any "act or thing which without "such pardon or amnesty "would disqualify him from "registration or voting."
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32046300P5' xml:id='OTP32046300P5'>(3) The same act Section 6 provides that "No person "who has held any executive "or judicial office in any "state and has afterwards "engaged in <rs ref='#S86078'>insurrection</rs> "or rebellion against the "United States or given aid "or comfort to the <rs ref='#S70882'>enemies</rs> "thereof is not entitled to "be registered or to vote."

<p corresp='TTP32046300P6' xml:id='OTP32046300P6'>(4) Charles M. Benbrooke held an office as Constable of <rs ref='#S77229'>Police</rs> of Adams Co. Miss. But it does not ap-pear from the record sent to District Head Quarters whether or not after hold-ing said office he engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States or gave aid and comfort to the enemies thereof.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP32046300P7' xml:id='OTP32046300P7'>(5) It might be inferred that he did so on account of his having subsequently taken the oath of amnesty but the District Commander is informed there was a class of persons who took this oath of amnesty
