                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32022696P0'>William Gannaway Brownlow, popularly known as “Parson” Brownlow, was a newspaper publisher, minister, and politician who served as governor of Tennessee during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P1'>Born on August 29, 1805, in Wythe County, Virginia, Brownlow was orphaned at the age of 10 and lived with an uncle until adulthood. He initially studied carpentry, but chose to become a Methodist minister after a religious conversion in 1825. The next year, he joined a travelling ministry and over the next several years preached to different communities across North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Brownlow’s time as an itinerant preacher was marked by his strong criticism of Baptists. His verbal and written condemnations of that denomination nearly led to his lynching in South Carolina. Brownlow married Eliza O’Brian in 1836 in Tennessee and ceased his traveling ministry work. However, he continued to write pamphlets to promote Methodism, and condemn other religious groups, leading to his nickname and reputation as the “Fighting Parson.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P2'>Having settled in Tennessee, Brownlow became a notable newspaper publisher in the late 1830s. His work, primarily published through his newspaper the <hi rend='italic'>Whig</hi>, embraced his new cause--support of Whig Party politics. Brownlow criticized his political opponents as harshly as he had his religious antagonists, leading to heightened emotions in his town and even physical confrontations. In one instance, Brownlow attacked a rival newspaper editor, Landon Carter Haynes, in the streets of Jonesborough, Tennessee, with a cane. Haynes drew a handgun and shot Brownlow in the leg.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P3'>In 1845, Brownlow ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives against Andrew Johnson, future president of the United States. Brownlow used his newspaper to level several personal attacks against Johnson, including accusations that Johnson was an illegitimate child, related to murders and thieves, and an atheist. Johnson won the election, but it was not the last time the two men faced off politically.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P4'>In the 1850s, Brownlow joined the temperance (anti-alcohol) movement and joined the Know Nothing Party (an anti-immigration political movement). He again used his writings to promote his new causes, railing against Catholics, immigrants, and Democratic politicians as threats to the United States. His views on slavery also transformed during this period. He had opposed slavery as a young man, even signing an abolitionist petition in 1834, and during the 1840s, he had supported the American Colonization Society, which sought to send liberated slaves to Liberia, Africa. By the 1850s, he expressed strong pro-slavery views, even arguing that the institution was supported by God. He challenged northern abolitionists to debate the merits of slavery, and in 1858 conducted one such debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in which he predicted that slavery would exist forever.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P5'>Despite his southern roots and defense of slavery, Brownlow opposed southern secession following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency in 1860. After his state of Tennessee joined the Confederacy, Brownlow continued to use his newspaper to print condemnations of secessionists. He supported an effort to separate the largely pro-Union eastern section of Tennessee from the rest of the state, and was famously quoted as saying, “We intend to fight the secessionists until hell freezes over, and then fight them on ice.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P6'>Brownlow was arrested by Confederate authorities on charges of treason. He eventually secured his release and traveled to Union lines, becoming a celebrity in the north for his defiance against the Confederacy. He conducted a speaking tour across the northeast and published a critical book about secession. He returned to Tennessee after Union armies secured most of the state and restarted his newspaper in Knoxville.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P7'>In January 1865, the Unionist government of Tennessee nominated Brownlow for governor. He was the only candidate and won by a vote of 23,352 to 35, although ex-Confederates were not permitted to vote. Brownlow supported the Lincoln administration’s policies, including the Thirteenth Amendment which abolished slavery. He also took a hard line on former Confederates, imposing fines on people wearing Confederate uniforms and prohibiting Confederate ministers from conducting ceremonies like marriages. Brownlow then turned against Andrew Johnson, who as vice president was elevated to the presidency with the assassination of Lincoln. Brownlow believed Johnson was too lenient on the former Confederates, and he even suspected the president was sympathetic enough to lead a second southern rebellion.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P8'>Brownlow worked to protect the rights of African Americans in Tennessee. Despite his previous outspoken support of slavery and white supremacy, during Reconstruction he argued that a loyal Black man was a better citizen than a disloyal white man. He strengthened the Tennessee militia to combat the Ku Klux Klan and other conservative white groups that sought to limit Black civil rights. In 1869, his last year in office, Brownlow placed several Tennessee counties under martial law to combat violence against Republicans and Black residents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022696P9'>Following his two terms as governor, Brownlow was elected to the U.S. Senate. He served a single term and continued to support Republican Reconstruction efforts, but he recognized that southern white conservatives would ultimately overturn much of the change brought about by the Civil War and Reconstruction. He returned to Knoxville upon the end of his term in 1875. He died two years later, on April 28, 1877. Brownlow had at least five children with his wife Eliza. He is buried in Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville, Tennessee.
