                    <p xml:id='OTPS32022816P0'>George Franklin Brown was a Republican judge in Mississippi during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022816P1'>Born in 1820 in Portage County, Ohio, Brown attended Meadville College in Pennsylvania and then studied law in Warren, Ohio. In 1845, he began practicing law in Parkman, Ohio, in 1845 and then served two terms as a probate judge in Warren. In 1864, during the Civil War, Brown was elected to the Ohio Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022816P2'>Following the Civil War, he moved to Mississippi in support of the Republican Party and the Reconstruction efforts there. He was appointed to the state’s Supreme Court in 1868 and served in that role until 1870. After leaving that court, Brown was elected to two terms as judge of Mississippi’s Fifteenth District court. He left Mississippi in the late 1870s and moved to Manhattan, Kansas. Four years later, he moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and resumed practicing law, eventually setting up a law firm with his son-in-law. Brown died on May 17, 1893.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022816P3'>He was married to Frances C. Janes and had five children. Brown is buried Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Omaha, Nebraska.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104759P1'>Born on December 17, 1813, in Chester County, South Carolina, Foote moved to Macon, Mississippi, in his youth. He studied law and became a practicing attorney, but also worked as a farmer raising cattle, a newspaper editor, a Chancery Clerk, and a district judge. He was a member of the Whig Party and unsuccessfully ran for the Mississippi House of Representatives in the mid-1850s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104759P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Foote volunteered for military service. He was made a captain in the First Mississippi Cavalry Battalion, and later was promoted to colonel within the Mississippi state militia. Foote saw action at Belmont and Shiloh.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104759P3'>After the war, Foote again pursued political office. He was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives and the Mississippi Senate. Through his various business pursuits (which included serving as president of the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Macon, Mississippi), as well as property he received through marriage, Foote became extremely wealthy. He owned at least four plantations, and helped found Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104759P4'>Foote died on January 29, 1899. He had been married four times, first to Lucinda Davis, who passed away in 1856. He then married Margy G. Foote (a cousin), who died in 1859. Foote then married Sybilla Antoinette Messinger, and was last married to Eleanor W. Curtiss. He had at least nine children. Foote is buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Macon, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32023233P0'>Charles A. Sullivan was a politician in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32023233P1'>Born in 1835 in Tennessee, Sullivan moved to Mississippi as a child with his family. He studied and law and became a practicing attorney in Greensboro, Mississippi, during the 1850s. Sullivan became active in Mississippi state politics as a Republican in the late 1860s, and served in the state senate in the early 1870s. As a state senator, he served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and was temporarily president pro tem of senate. He resigned from the senate in 1874 and became chancellor of Mississippi’s Fifth District.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32023233P2'>Aside from his political and legal work, Sullivan reportedly worked to design the world’s first flying machine. In 1879, while living in Starkville, he claimed to have invented an aerial vehicle sixty feet long and fourteen feet wide capable of flying two hundred feet high and up to sixty-five miles per hour. Sullivan supposedly filed a request to the U.S. Patent Office to protect his intellectual property rights as he tested the design. In 1880, he campaigned to raise $4,000 to fund the construction of two of his flying machines, with promises to fly from New York to Liverpool, England. Little else was heard from Sullivan of his proposed invention, and his appeals for funding may not have generated much support, as the editor of <hi rend='italic'>The Brookhaven Ledger</hi> wrote dryly, “We think he can be gotten rid of for less than $4,000.
</p>

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32069934P0'>Henry Lowndes Muldrow was a Confederate soldier, prominent Ku Klux Klan figure, and politician from Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32069934P1'>Born on February 8, 1837, in Lowndes County, Mississippi, Muldrow graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1858, received a law degree from the same university in 1859, and became a practicing attorney in 1860. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he volunteered for Confederate military service and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Fourteenth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Muldrow later served as a lieutenant colonel in the Eleventh Mississippi Cavalry Regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32069934P2'>When the Civil War ended, Muldrow returned to practicing law, becoming the attorney for the sixth judicial district. While in that position he took part in secretive efforts to disenfranchise Black Mississippians and reinstate white supremacy. Muldrow became the “Grand Cyclops,” or leader, of the Ku Klux Klan in Oktibbeha County. He used his Klan connections and reputation for opposing Republican Reconstruction and Black civil rights to win election to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1875. His electoral victory was also due in part to violence and intimidation against Republican voters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32069934P3'>In 1876, Muldrow won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served four consecutive terms, leaving Congress in 1885 to become First Assistant Secretary of the Interior under President Grover Cleveland. He held that position until 1889, when he resigned and returned to Mississippi and practiced law. Muldrow was a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention in 1890, which reinstituted several restrictions against Black rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32069934P4'>Muldrow died on March 1, 1905. He was married to Eliza Ervin and had at least two children.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
