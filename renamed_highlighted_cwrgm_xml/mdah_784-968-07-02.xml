                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32031782P0'>Rutherford Birchard Hayes was an abolitionist, a Union general during the Civil War, and president of the United States.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P1'>Born on October 4, 1822, in Delaware, Ohio, Hayes attended various schools, including the Methodist Norwalk Seminary and Kenyon College. He then graduated from Harvard Law School in 1843 and became a practicing attorney in Ohio in 1845. He moved to Cincinnati in 1850 for greater professional opportunities. Among the types of cases he took including defending fugitive slaves who had escaped into Ohio from Kentucky. The work helped boost his credentials in the burgeoning anti-slavery Republican Party of the 1850s and in 1859, Hayes was elected city solicitor in Cincinnati.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Hayes volunteered for military service and was commissioned a major in the Twenty-third Ohio Infantry Regiment. (Another member to join that unit was Private William McKinley, also a future president.) Hayes was later promoted to lieutenant colonel and during the Battle of South Mountain in Maryland in September 1862, he was shot in the arm while leading his men against the Confederate line. After recovering from his wound, Hayes was promoted to brevet (honorary) brigadier general and commanded a brigade during campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. He performed well during various engagements against Confederate soldiers in 1864, receiving a slight wound at Kernstown, Virginia, in July. His actions at the Battle of Cedar Creek led to praise from Ulysses S. Grant. He received a full promotion to brigadier general and brevet promotion to major general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P3'>In 1864, while Hayes served in uniform, Republicans in his home district of Ohio nominated him for the U.S. House of Representatives. He refused to leave the army for a political position, but won election anyway, and waited to enter Congress until December 1865. Hayes considered himself a moderate Republican, but worked alongside the Radicals on many issues for Reconstruction. For instance, he supported the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. He voted for the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, during a dispute between the president and Radical Republicans, and for the Tenure of Office Act, which prohibited the president from removing cabinet officials without the U.S. Senate’s consent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P4'>In July 1867, Hayes resigned from Congress to run for governor of Ohio. He won a close election and proved to be a popular leader, who supported equal rights for Black residents of Ohio. He won reelection more handily and pushed his state to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment. He also helped expand educational opportunities to all Ohioans. He chose not to run for a third term and left the governor’s office in 1872.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P5'>Hayes spent a few years enjoying private life with his wife, Lucy Webb, and young children. Additionally, an economic downturn in the United States, known as the Panic of 1873, hurt his financial investments and prompted him to focus on his law firm and other activities to rebuild his family’s savings. However, when the Republican Party in Ohio nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted and won election that fall. His tenure was again marked with success, as he helped reduce Ohio’s debt and signed several other popular bills into law.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P6'>Hayes’s popularity and success in Ohio politics elevated him to attention within the national Republican Party. He was successfully nominated by a powerful lobby of Ohio Republicans for the 1876 presidential election. By this time, many Republicans were turning away from federal Reconstruction, and Hayes’s campaign advocated reconciliation with the traditional Whigs of the south, even if it meant moving away from a strong defense of African American civil rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P7'>The 1876 election was extremely close and contentious. Hayes’s Democratic opponent, Samuel Tilden, appeared to have won the election from the immediate returns. However, reports of fraud placed the final results in doubt and led to a contested election. The matter stretched for weeks, and in February 1877 an electoral commission made up of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices (seven of which were Republicans, seven which were Democrats, and one which was technically independent) met to decide the election winner. The commission’s seven Republicans and nominal independent gave the election to Hayes, outraging Democrats. To assuage the Democrats and secure Hayes’s victory, Republican leaders in Congress met with their Democratic counterparts and offered a compromise that involved the end of Reconstruction. Federal troops would be withdrawn from the south, ensuring Democratic control of the former Confederate states. With the agreement in place, Democrats dropped their opposition to Hayes’s electoral victory, and he, after being inaugurated, ordered the U.S. Army to stand down and turn over all state government activities to local southerners. This act is seen as the official end of Reconstruction. It also marked the end of direct federal protection of African American civil rights in the south until the mid-twentieth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P8'>Hayes’s presidential tenure involved several major political and domestic events, including a significant railroad strike in 1877 (which involved him calling the U.S. Army against railway workers), civil service reforms, and efforts to assimilate Native Americans into American culture. He promised to serve only one term, and declined to run for reelection in 1880.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32031782P9'>After leaving the presidency, Hayes acted as an elder statesman in Ohio, advising on political matters but not running for office. He advocated for various social improvements, especially education. He died on January 17, 1893, at the age of 70. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Fremont, Ohio.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.
