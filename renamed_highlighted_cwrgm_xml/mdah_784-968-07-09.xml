                    <p xml:id='OTPS32065737P0'>Powell Clayton was a U.S. Army officer, the Republican governor of Arkansas from 1868 to 1871, a U.S. Senator, and a U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32065737P1'>Born on August 7, 1833 in Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, Clayton studied civil engineering in Wilmington, Delaware. In 1855, he relocated to Kansas and worked as a surveyor and land speculator. As his first step into politics, by 1860, he was elected as the city engineer of Leavanworth, Kansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32065737P2'>During the Civil War, Clayton enlisted as a captain in the U.S. Volunteers, serving in the 1st Kansas Infantry. He was stationed primarily in Missouri and Arkansas. In 1863, he was assigned to command in Pine Bluff, Jefferson County, Arkansas, where he remained for the rest of the war. An able and respected commander, Clayton was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on August 1, 1864. He was commander of a cavalry division of the Seventh Army Corps by the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32065737P3'>During the war, Clayton invested in cotton, which allowed him to purchase a plantation in Jefferson County, Arkansas. He and his brothers relocated there after the Confederate Army surrendered. Although he was frequently absent from the plantation, he kept the land his entire life, eventually accumulating approximately 40,000 acres.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32065737P4'>A a leader of the Republican Party in Arkansas, Clayton was inaugurated as the ninth governor of Arkansas on July 2, 1868. He served until March 17, 1871. Labeled a "Radical Republican" and a "carpetbagger," he faced intense opposition from the state's conservative leaders and even survived an attempt on his life. Clayton responded to Ku Klux Klan violence and the assassination of a Republican congressman, James Hinds, by mobilizing the state militia and by declaring martial law in fourteen counties in late 1868. His actions successfully ended Klan activity early into his administration. Clayton also successfully pushed for the funding of railroads in Arkansas, and the first free public school system was created under his leadership.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32065737P5'>In an affair known as the Brooks-Baxter War, in 1868, Joseph Brooks, who had been an ally of Clayton's in forming the Republican Party in Arkansas, broke with Clayton and formed a faction known as the "Brindle-tails." Brooks pointed to Clayton's increasingly moderate stance towards former Confederates, but he was also angry over being displaced by Clayton in the Republican Party. The "Brindle-tails" impeached Clayton in 1871, claiming political corruption and abuse of power in the governor's suppression of Klan violence. The "Brindle-tails" tried to take control again in 1874 against Republican governor Elisha Baxter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32065737P6'>In March 1871 Clayton became a U.S. Senator for Arkansas, until the Democratic Party took control of the Arkansas legislature in March 1877. After losing his seat, Clayton returned to Little Rock Arkansas, where he worked as a lawyer. In 1882, he purchased land in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, which was a growing resort town. He became the president of the Eureka Springs Improvement Company (ESIC) and pushed forward the ESIC's sponsorship of the Eureka Springs Railroad, which was central to the town's expansion. The following year (1883), he became the railroad's president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32065737P7'>Clayton also remained the state leader of the the Republican Party, and from 1897 to 1905, he served as the U.S. ambassador to Mexico under U.S. Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. After resigning his post due to personal reasons, Clayton relocated to Washington D.C. for the rest of his life.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32065737P8'>Clayton was married to Adaline (McGraw) Clayton. The pair had three daughters and two sons, although one son died in infancy. Powell Clayton died on August 25, 1914 in Washington D.C. and was buried in the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

He served with a Pennsylvania artillery unit, and eventually received a promotion to captain of volunteers and an appointment as an assistant adjutant general (administrative officer) in 1865. After the Civil War, when the federal government discharged volunteer units, Atwood took a commission as a first lieutenant in the regular army and served as an adjutant with the occupation forces in Mississippi during the late 1860s. Atwood then took an assignment on the staff of General Philip St. George Cooke, who was in command of the Department of the Lakes in the Midwest.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32124056P0'>The 4th Military District of the United States Army was established by the First Reconstruction Act, passed by the Fortieth United States Congress on March 2, 1867. It encompassed the states of Arkansas and Mississippi with its headquarters at Vicksburg, Mississippi under the command of Maj. Gen. Edward O. C. Ord. It was later commanded by Maj. Gens. Alvan C. Gillem, Irvin McDowell, and Adelbert Ames. It was one of five military districts that placed ten of the former Confederate states under military authority. Its function was to protect the rights of freedmen, keep the peace, and oversee the election and formation of new state governments in Arkansas and Mississippi loyal to the federal government in Washington D. C. During its existence it combated the rampant post-war racial and political violence experienced throughout the South during that time. Arkansas ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and adopted a new state constitution in the spring of 1868 and on June 22, 1868 was readmitted to the Union, leaving Mississippi the sole state of the district. It disbanded when Mississippi returned to civil government and was readmitted to the Union on February 23, 1870.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.
