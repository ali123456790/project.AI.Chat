                    <p xml:id='OTPS32026126P0'>Henry Clay Warmoth was a Union officer and then governor of Louisiana during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P1'>Born on May 9, 1842, in McLeansboro, Illinois, Warmoth grew up in Illinois, studied law, and then became a practicing attorney in Missouri in 1860. He quickly rose in prominence, becoming a district attorney in Missouri’s Eighteen Judicial District. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Warmoth volunteered for Union service and was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Thirty-Second Missouri Infantry Regiment. He saw combat in Arkansas and Mississippi, and was wounded at Vicksburg in 1863. Warmoth was dishonorably discharged for false reporting of casualties, but was reinstated after personally appealing to President Abraham Lincoln. Returning to his regiment, Warmoth led the unit during fighting around Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in Georgia during William Tecumseh Sherman’s Atlanta campaign. He later received an appointment as a military judge in the Department of the Gulf Provost Court. Warmoth resigned his commission in 1865 to return to practicing law, and soon settled in New Orleans, Louisiana, to work on cases regarding cotton claims and courts-martial.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P2'>While in New Orleans, Warmoth became active in Republican Party politics. During the Reconstruction era, Warmoth managed to rise to the Republican Party ticket for governor. He won the gubernatorial election in 1868 and entered the Louisiana governor’s office at the age of 26. He labored to protect Black voting rights and to combat violence by white supremacist groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan. However, he was also accused of being soft on former Confederates, and favoring white applicants over African Americans for government jobs. As a result, the Republican Party in Louisiana split, and by 1871 Warmoth sided with the Liberal Republican Party that backed Horace Greeley in the 1872 election instead of Ulysses S. Grant. These efforts reduced Warmoth’s support even more among Black Louisianans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P3'>In 1872, the Louisiana legislature—controlled by anti-Warmoth Republicans—filed impeachment charges against him. He was suspended from office, but as a lame duck incumbent, the state legislature allowed him to vacate his office just a few weeks before his term ended without carrying out the full impeachment trial.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P4'>After leaving office, Warmoth bought a sugar cane plantation and used his legal experience to represent sugar planting interests in the U.S. and in Europe. By the mid-1880s, he abandoned his sugar planting work and returned to politics. He ran for governor in 1888, but lost to Democrat Francis T. Nicholls. In 1890, he received an appointment as U.S. Collector of Customs in New Orleans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P5'>Warmoth lived well into the twentieth century, dying on September 30, 1931. He was married to Sallie Durand and had three children. Warmoth is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).
