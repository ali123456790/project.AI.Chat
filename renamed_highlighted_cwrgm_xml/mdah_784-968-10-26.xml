</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022859P1'>Born on March 31, 1827, in Cicero, New York, Crandall studied medicine at Cincinnati’s Eclectic School of Medicine and became a practicing physician in 1851. He moved to Illinois and volunteered for military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Crandall first enlisted in the Fifth Illinois Light Artillery before being appointed assistant surgeon of the Twenty-fourth Illinois Infantry Regiment. At the end of the war, Crandall served as a surgeon at a U.S. military post in Brookhaven, Mississippi. He remained there until being appointed private secretary to military governor Adelbert Ames in 1869. He returned to Illinois in 1870 and worked as a physician for several more years.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32024241P0'>Moses Hubbard Tuttle was a Union officer during the Civil War who became a public official in Mississippi during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32024241P1'>Born in 1839 in Massachusetts, Tuttle volunteered for military service after the Civil War broke out in 1861. He first served in the Forty-ninth Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, before being commissioned as an officer in the Fiftieth United States Colored Infantry Regiment, a regiment comprised of Black soldiers from Louisiana. Tuttle was promoted to lieutenant colonel and participated with the regiment in campaigns in the deep south. In particular, Tuttle was present at the Battle of Fort Blakeley in April 1865. After the Civil War, Tuttle remained in military service as part of the occupation force in Mississippi. He then separated from the army and accepted an appointment as sheriff in Carroll County, Mississippi, from Governor Adelbert Ames in 1869. He served in that capacity for several years, and then was elected to the Mississippi Senate in the mid-1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32024241P2'>Tuttle left Mississippi in the late nineteenth century and moved west. He died in 1911 in Washington state. He was married to Emma Teresa Taggart and had at least one child that lived to adulthood. Tuttle is buried in Sunset Memorial Park in Hoquiam, Washington.
