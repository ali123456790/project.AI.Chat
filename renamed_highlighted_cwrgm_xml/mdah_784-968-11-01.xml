                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53282P0'>Currently located in Copiah County, Gallatin was founded in 1819 in what was then a "non-county area." On February 12, 1821 it was merged into Hinds County until January 21, 1823, when Gallatin became part of the newly founded Copiah County. It was incorporated in 1829 and served as the county seat until 1872 (when it was replaced by Hazlehurst). Presently, Gallatin is a deserted town with few or no remaining inhabitants.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.
