                    <p xml:id='OTPS32026126P0'>Henry Clay Warmoth was a Union officer and then governor of Louisiana during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P1'>Born on May 9, 1842, in McLeansboro, Illinois, Warmoth grew up in Illinois, studied law, and then became a practicing attorney in Missouri in 1860. He quickly rose in prominence, becoming a district attorney in Missouri’s Eighteen Judicial District. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Warmoth volunteered for Union service and was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Thirty-Second Missouri Infantry Regiment. He saw combat in Arkansas and Mississippi, and was wounded at Vicksburg in 1863. Warmoth was dishonorably discharged for false reporting of casualties, but was reinstated after personally appealing to President Abraham Lincoln. Returning to his regiment, Warmoth led the unit during fighting around Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in Georgia during William Tecumseh Sherman’s Atlanta campaign. He later received an appointment as a military judge in the Department of the Gulf Provost Court. Warmoth resigned his commission in 1865 to return to practicing law, and soon settled in New Orleans, Louisiana, to work on cases regarding cotton claims and courts-martial.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P2'>While in New Orleans, Warmoth became active in Republican Party politics. During the Reconstruction era, Warmoth managed to rise to the Republican Party ticket for governor. He won the gubernatorial election in 1868 and entered the Louisiana governor’s office at the age of 26. He labored to protect Black voting rights and to combat violence by white supremacist groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan. However, he was also accused of being soft on former Confederates, and favoring white applicants over African Americans for government jobs. As a result, the Republican Party in Louisiana split, and by 1871 Warmoth sided with the Liberal Republican Party that backed Horace Greeley in the 1872 election instead of Ulysses S. Grant. These efforts reduced Warmoth’s support even more among Black Louisianans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P3'>In 1872, the Louisiana legislature—controlled by anti-Warmoth Republicans—filed impeachment charges against him. He was suspended from office, but as a lame duck incumbent, the state legislature allowed him to vacate his office just a few weeks before his term ended without carrying out the full impeachment trial.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P4'>After leaving office, Warmoth bought a sugar cane plantation and used his legal experience to represent sugar planting interests in the U.S. and in Europe. By the mid-1880s, he abandoned his sugar planting work and returned to politics. He ran for governor in 1888, but lost to Democrat Francis T. Nicholls. In 1890, he received an appointment as U.S. Collector of Customs in New Orleans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32026126P5'>Warmoth lived well into the twentieth century, dying on September 30, 1931. He was married to Sallie Durand and had three children. Warmoth is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32023925P1'>Born around 1837 in Portland, Maine, Parker was a Sergeant in the 1st Maine Cavalry during the Civil War. After the war, he moved to Amite County, Mississippi, where he served as the county sheriff from 1869 to 1876. In September 1869, he was also appointed as the postmaster for the county. In 1876, he testifed about the violence he had witnessed against Black people in the name of the Democratic Party before relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana, possibly to avoid retaliation. In New Orleans, he became the private secretary to the postmaster and was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic, the largest U.S. Army veterans' organization for men who served during the Civil War. The organization included 410,000 men at its peak in 1890. Parker applied for a pension on July 21, 1888.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32023925P2'>Parker was married to Henrietta Parker. The pair had one daughter who lived to adulthood. Aurelius S. Parker died on March 20, 1892 in New Orleans, Louisiana and was buried in the Chalmette National Cemetery in Chalmette, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)
