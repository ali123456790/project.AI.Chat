                    <p xml:id='OTPS32011998P0'>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys was governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during the first three years of Reconstruction. Born on August 26, 1808, in Claiborne County, Mississippi, Humphreys spent many years in the north as a boy, attending school in New Jersey and then being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Enrolled in the same class as Robert E. Lee, Humphreys was expelled shortly afterwards for his participation in the “Eggnog riot” (or “grog mutiny”)—an alcohol-fueled ruckus at West Point on the night of December 24-25, 1826, that resulted in the removal of twenty students.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P1'>Humphreys returned to Mississippi where he studied law and helped his father on the family plantation.  He married Mary McLaughlin in 1832. The couple had two children before Mary died in 1835. He remarried in 1839 to Mildred Maury and had at least ten more children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P2'>In the 1830s, Humphreys entered local politics as a Whig, serving as a state representative and then as a member of the Mississippi senate from 1839 to 1844. He purchased land to establish a cotton plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1846, and helped establish the town of Itta Bena.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P3'>During the lead up to the Civil War, Humphreys opposed secession. However, after Mississippi declared its separation from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America, he volunteered for military service and was eventually elected colonel of the Twenty-first Mississippi Infantry. Humphreys and his regiment served within Brigadier General William Barksdale’s brigade in the eastern theater, notably seeing action at the Peach Orchard during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Barksdale was killed during the battle, and Humphreys was promoted to brigadier general to take his place. He remained in command of the brigade until September 1864 when he was wounded at Berryville, Virginia. He spent the rest of the Civil War recuperating from his wounds.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P4'>Humphreys became active in the immediate postwar political scene in Mississippi. He won election for governor in October 1865 during Mississippi’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, Humphreys was among the former southern leaders initially denied presidential pardon by Johnson. Although Johnson soon relented, sending a pardon to Humphreys, the Mississippi legislature’s passage of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans sparked a fierce backlash by Republicans in the United States Congress, who then refused to admit Mississippi back into the Union. Federal authorities instituted a stricter Reconstruction program, which included oversight by military officials. Humphreys remained governor, as Reconstruction did not disassemble Mississippi’s civil government. However, Humphreys did not enjoy the full authority of a traditional state executive. His white supremacist views and opposition to Black civil rights put him in frequent opposition to Republican Reconstruction goals. He won reelection in 1868, but soon afterwards was ejected from office by federal authorities when Radical Republicans took more direct control of Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32011998P5'>Following his removal as governor in 1868, Humphreys left politics and began working in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He retired in 1877 and died in December 1882 and is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery at Port Gibson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32014839P0'>Bartley Barry Boone was an attorney, Confederate officer, and district judge in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32014839P1'>Born on April 6, 1831, Boone studied law and became a successful attorney in Mississippi. He entered state politics in the 1850s, serving in the Mississippi House of Representatives and participating in Democratic party conventions as a delegate from Tishomingo in the 1850s. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Boone volunteered for Confederate service. He helped raise a company of volunteers, known as the Tishomingo Riflemen, and was then commissioned as an officer in the Second Mississippi Infantry Regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32014839P2'>Boone was the highest Confederate officer captured by Union troops at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The incident occurred in part due to the irregular uniforms worn by Union and Confederate soldiers during the first major engagement of the Civil War. When soldiers of the First Minnesota Infantry Regiment, wearing red shirts, opened fire on Boone’s Second Mississippi Infantry, he mistook them for the Fourth Alabama Infantry Regiment, which also wore red shirts. Boone rode his horse to the red-shirted infantrymen and ordered them to cease firing on their “friends.” Only when he suddenly found a bayonet at his chest and a demand to surrender did Boone realize his mistake.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32014839P3'>Boone survived the Civil War and was again elected to the Mississippi legislature in 1865. In 1866, he was appointed the Ninth Judicial Circuit. Beyond his judicial and legal work, Boone also helped establish the town of Booneville, Mississippi, with land he purchased with G. W. Williams, and W. P. Curlee from members of the Chickasaw Nation. He died in 1905 in that town. Boone was married twice, first to Lou M. Petty, who passed away in 1861. He then married Margaret Petty. He had at least three children who survived to adulthood. Boone is buried in Booneville Cemetery in Booneville, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25010082P0'>Thomas Jefferson Mitchell was a physician and the superintendent of the Mississippi State Insane Asylum in the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010082P1'>Born in Alabama in 1830, Mitchell attended the University of Alabama for two years and then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a degree in medicine in 1852. He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, and became a practicing physician. Eager to expand his education, Mitchell spent two years in Berlin, Germany, during the mid-1850s studying various medical techniques and theories. He was aback in Mississippi at the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 and volunteered his medical services to the Confederate war effort. Mitchell served as the surgeon of the Thirty-ninth Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Suffering from his own health problems, he was frequently forced to take leave from service in the field.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010082P2'>After the Civil War, Mitchell returned to practicing medicine in Jackson. He participated in some political activities as a Conservative Democrat, in opposition to the Republicans, during Reconstruction, even being nominated for mayor of Jackson in 1875. Most of Mitchell’s public activities, though, involved his medical profession. He served as a medical advisor for various organizations, and worked as health examiner for various life insurance companies, such as Western and Southern Life Institution and the North America Life Insurance Company of New York. In 1878, he was appointed superintendent of the Mississippi State Insane Hospital and remained in that post until he retired in 1911.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25010082P3'>Mitchell died on September 16, 1912. He was married to Annie McWillie, who died in 1878—thirty-four years before him; he never remarried. The couple had six children. Mitchell is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32076240P0'>Alexander K. Davis was a representative in the Mississippi legislature and served as the state’s lieutenant governor from 1874 to 1876, during Reconstruction. He was the first African American lieutenant governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32076240P1'>Little was recorded of Davis’ past. His date and place of birth are not known. During testimony before Congress in 1871 he explained that he moved to Noxubee County, Mississippi, from Tennessee in 1869, and said he had been admitted to the bar (a reference that he had been accepted as a practicing attorney in a city or county), but did not specify in which state. He won a seat in Mississippi’s House of Representatives shortly after coming to Mississippi and became a leading figure in the state’s Republican Party circles. In 1873, Radical Republicans backed by a majority of African American voters in Mississippi, won a series of state elections. Davis was one of three African Americans elected to statewide office that year, winning the lieutenant governor seat. (The other Black figures to win statewide election were James Hill as secretary of state and T. W. Cardozo as state superintendent of education.) The following year, white conservatives carried out a campaign of intimidation and violence to suppress Republican and African American voting and put Democrats into political power. The effort worked and by 1875, Democrats held a majority of state legislative seats. Emboldened by their political power, Democrats tried to rid Republicans from many state positions. They specifically targeted Davis and northern-born and Radical Republican Governor Adelbert Ames, accusing both men of improprieties in office. Davis was charged with illegal granting of pardons. Despite his effort to fight the trumped-up charges, Mississippi Democrats impeached Davis in March 1876. Knowing that the conviction would result in him being removed from office, Davis resigned. Governor Ames, also facing politically-driven impeachment proceedings that would require extensive time and financial resources to fight, resigned as well. Following his resignation, Davis abandoned politics. He moved to Canton, Mississippi and worked as a pastor. He died on November 21, 1884.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71951P0'>James Ronald Chalmers was a Confederate officer and served as a U.S. Representative for Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P1'>Born in Halifax County, Virginia, on January 11, 1831, Chalmers moved with his family to Mississippi during his youth, settling in Holly Springs. After graduating from South Carolina College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in Holly Springs in 1853. Five years later, he was elected district attorney. He was selected as a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in 1861, and helped pass the ordinance of secession which declared the state separate from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P2'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, Chalmers volunteered for military service. He was first commissioned as a captain the Confederate army and soon received a promotion to colonel of the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. After commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida, Chalmers was promoted again, to brigadier general. He performed well during the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and again during the Battle of Murfreesboro from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. In 1864, he fought in western Tennessee, including the Battle of Fort Pillow, which involved Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest murdering several African American Union prisoners. In 1865, he was placed in charge of all Mississippi cavalry in the Mississippi and western Tennessee region. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P3'>After the Civil War, Chalmers returned to Mississippi and resumed practicing law. He gained fame among white conservatives through his opposition to Republican Reconstruction, and led an armed group of Democrats to Friar’s Point in 1876 to chase away the sheriff and intimidate African Americans in the area. That same year he won a state senate seat. When Mississippi was readmitted to the Union, Chalmers won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1877 to 1880. Although he again won reelection in 1880, his Republican opponent, John R. Lynch, disputed the election results. A Congressional investigation found in favor for Lynch, but not until 1882 after Chalmers had served most of the term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P4'>Around 1882, Chalmers broke with the traditional Democratic Party in Mississippi. He ran for reelection in 1882, but as an Independent Democrat with support from some Republicans and the Greenback Party (which was a third-party political movement that focused on economic matters). A traditional Democrat candidate, Van H. Manning, won the election, but this time Chalmers contested the results. Congress decided in Chalmer’s favor and he reentered Congress in June 1884, but lost reelection later that fall.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P5'>Chalmers returned to practicing law after the 1884 election. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and died on April 29, 1882. He had been married to Rebecca Arthur; the couple had two children. Chalmers is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99399P0'>Plantations are farms that typically grow cash crops, and often specialize in a single product, such as cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane. Plantation farming continues in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century, especially for crops like coffee beans, rubber trees, and cocoa. In American history the term plantation is most often associated with estates in the American south. Historical descriptions of plantations generate images of large farming operations. However, even moderately-sized southern farms that planted cash crops were sometimes referred to as plantations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P1'>Southern plantations before the Civil War were strongly tied to the institution of slavery. As profit-driven agricultural operations, plantations required large numbers of laborers. This fed the demand for African slave importation to the British colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and bolstered the defense of slavery among southern planters in the nineteenth century. Plantation crops varied by region within the south, with rice being popular in Georgia and South Carolina along the Atlantic coast, tobacco being an early cash crop in Virginia, and then—after the invention of the cotton gin at the end of the eighteenth century which quickly separated seeds from the cotton fibers—the boom in cotton growing across the Deep South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P2'>By 1860, there were approximately 46,200 plantations across the south. More than 20,000 had twenty to thirty slaves. Only about 2,300, or five percent, had one hundred or more slaves. The enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work. The plantations were their home. The same was not always true for the plantation owners. The very large operations frequently had wealthy absentee owners, who resided in cities or other states, leaving plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers. Slave cabins, or slave quarters, were a ubiquitous part of a plantation. They represented the heart of the laborers’ community on the property, but were usually of basic construction and few amenities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P3'>Following the abolition of slavery after the Civil War, many freed people continued to live on plantations. Sharecropping became a popular arrangement between the landowners and the laborers. The property was often divided into plots with tenants assigned to certain sections. The system involved a contract or arrangement which allowed the laborer, or tenant, to keep a portion of the crop they raised. The system was abused, and developed a negative reputation for the level of poverty many sharecroppers (mostly Black, but some white) experienced on plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Representatives of the Freedmen’s Bureau sought to protect Black sharecroppers by regulating contracts during Reconstruction, but the withdrawal of federal officials after 1876 left many African American tenants more subject to unfair sharecropping contracts on the old plantations.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32082712P2'>By the mid-nineteenth century, Mississippi was the top cotton producing state in the Union. In 1860, it had around 37,000 farms. Almost 25,000 of them were plantations over one hundred acres in size, although only 481 were truly extravagant at over one thousand acres. Cotton production required farmers and planters to invest a great deal into labor and equipment, leading Mississippi to rank third among the slaveholding states for total value of farm machinery ($8.8 million in 1860, or $330 million today), slightly trailing Virginia ($9.4 million in 1860, or $355 million today) and well behind Louisiana ($18.6 million in 1860, or $702 million today).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32082712P3'>Although plantations were profit-driven operations, many in Mississippi were self-sufficient, with subsistence farm plots and livestock to feed the labor force. Enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work on plantations. The plantations were their home. The largest plantations were like small villages, with many different buildings, including the master’s house (usually large and extravagant), barns, workshops, storage facilities, and slave quarters. Some plantation owners lived part-time on the property, or visited only occasionally, residing most of the year in cities or other states. They left plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P0'>When the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, it failed to abolish involuntary servitude. The amendment included a loophole banning involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted" (Library of Congress). White southerners in the post-emancipation South, concerned about both the availability of labor and the freedom of African Americans, manipulated this clause and turned to convict leasing to entrench long standing racial hierarchies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P1'>Immediately after the war, many states passed "Black Codes" or laws severely limiting African Americans' rights. Under these codes and other similar laws passed in the decades following the Civil War, African Americans could be arrested for any number of petty crimes, including vagrancy (functionally construed to mean any act of social mobility not approved by a white person) or theft (in Mississippi a felony if exceeding $10 worth of goods). Widespread racism and stereotypes about Black criminality led to a dramatic expansion in the population of imprisoned individuals and an overwhelming number of African Americans within that population. Many states leased those convicted persons to private companies or individuals for their labor, and in certain cases lessees had been the pre-emancipation enslaver of the leased.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P2'>Laborers worked in a variety of settings including shipbuilding and timber cutting, yet the most prominent form in states like Mississippi remained large-scale agricultural work. The convict lease system was incredibly dangerous and difficult for those who lived through it, as leased persons faced unsafe working conditions, inadequate living conditions, abuse from lessees, and grueling work schedules. Given these circumstances, the ready availability of imprisoned laborers, and the callousness of lessees and state officials, the mortality rate among convict laborers was incredibly high.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P3'>Certain states ceased leasing imprisoned persons to individuals or private companies in the late nineteenth century, only to continue using that labor on state-funded infrastructure projects like road or highway construction until, in some cases, World War II. Southern individuals and states thereby continued to increase their wealth through the coerced labor of African Americans while perpetuating anti-Black racism and laying the foundations of the modern prison-industrial complex (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P0'>In the wake of the Civil War, many states turned to convict leasing to bolster infrastructural repair and to maintain long standing racial hierarchies. Like many other southern states, Mississippi instituted a convict leasing program, and in 1876 the state passed the Leasing Act (commonly known as the “Pig Law”), which sentenced anyone who stole property valued at $10 or greater up to five years in prison and quadrupled the prison population, with Black prisoners comprising approximately 85% of inmates. The state most frequently leased convicted persons to individuals, primarily to perform agricultural work on cotton farms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P1'>However, the state also leased incarcerated persons to private companies, such as the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company, and companies subjected convict-laborers to excruciating working conditions with little shelter, sustenance, or medical care. While companies and private individuals leased enslaved workers during the antebellum era, enslavers expected “their human chattel to be returned alive and in good working condition” (Sturkey, <hi rend='italic'>Hattiesburg</hi>). However, this expectation was virtually nonexistent in postwar convict leasing programs. The death toll therefore grew to staggering heights. In response, Mississippi cancelled Gulf &amp; Ship Island’s contract in December 1888 and ceased leasing convicts to private companies in 1890. However, the state and individual counties and towns continued to use convict labor for public works projects and at the state’s penitentiary at Parchman plantation well into the twentieth century (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32031023P0'>Like many slaveholding states of the former Confederacy, Mississippi operated a convict leasing system between the 1860s–1900s. Under convict leasing systems, states leased imprisoned people to perform unfree labor for companies and individuals in exchange for a fee. State and county laws (such as "Pig Laws" and vagrancy laws) and racially selective prosecutions funneled large, overrepresented populations of African Americans into their prison institutions. Therefore, Mississippi's convict leasing system replaced the state's former system of race-based chattel slavery and laborers encountered harsh conditions, violent punishments, and high death tolls. Public outcry over these conditions, especially following the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company's convict leasing practices, forced Mississippi to abolish its convict leasing program in 1890, becoming the first state to do so. County governments, however, continued to operate convict leasing arrangements using chain gangs until the 1900s. In 1904 Mississippi opened Parchman Prison on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta and consolidated much of its convict labor there. (Mississippi Encyclopedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94826P0'>Desertion is the act of a military service member permanently leaving a unit without permission. It is considered a worse offense than being temporarily absent without leave (AWOL). Deserters were often accused of cowardice, especially during the early part of the Civil War, when enthusiasm for battle ran high. While soldiers arrested for desertion very early in the war faced loss of pay, Union and Confederate officers treated it more harshly as the war progressed. Some deserters faced corporal punishment and humiliation, while most others were imprisoned. In some instances, military authorities recommended the death penalty for desertion. However, most saw their death sentence commuted and instead faced imprisonment with hard labor. For example, the Union’s Army of Potomac captured roughly 2,000 deserters between July and November 1863. Of those, 80 received death sentences but only 21 were actually executed—around one percent of the total number of deserters. Those that were executed most often had their sentence carried out in front of their fellow soldiers, as a warning to other, would-be deserters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94826P1'>Reasons for desertion differed. Some soldiers fled from fear of battle, while many others ran away due to issues at home. Some Confederate soldiers deserted when their units were sent on campaigns outside their native state. This was not a problem among Union soldiers, who largely expected to march away from home to battle secessionists in the South. But, in the midst of the South’s highly charged climate of state sovereignty and home defense, not all Southern volunteers approved of being transferred for Confederate military service. One Mississippi soldier reported that as many as 125 members of his regiment deserted after they were sent to support Confederate forces in northern Georgia. Similar incidents happened with units across the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD94826P2'>The two most common reasons for desertion were unfavorable conditions within the military (such as poor quality food, shoddy equipment, or discontent with military leadership) and loss of faith in the war effort. The latter reason plagued the Confederacy in particular toward the end of the war. Concerned for their families as Union armies occupied much of the South, or believing that victory was impossible, tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers slipped away from their units in late 1864 and early 1865 never to return. These desertions severely weakened Confederate armies and contributed to lower morale, which in turn led to more desertions. In all, an estimated 103,000 Confederate soldiers and 200,000 Union soldiers deserted during the Civil War. (Wikipedia; Encyclopedia of Virginia; Mark A. Weitz, “Desertion, Cowardice and Punishment,” <hi rend='italic'>Essential Civil War Curriculum</hi>; Bell Irvin Wiley, <hi rend='italic'>The Life of Johnny Reb: The Common Soldier of the Confederacy</hi>,135-139; Wiley, <hi rend='italic'>The Life of Billy Yank: The Common Soldier of the Union</hi>, 205-207)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD77079P0'>Military discharges are formal notices issued to members of the armed forces confirming that they are formally released from their obligation to serve. During the American Civil War, soldiers and officers were honorably discharged from service for a variety of reasons, including severe injuries or diseases, resignation, or their unit mustering out, among other reasons. Those who were honorably discharged were eligible to reenlist or receive veterans' benefits after the war. (Wikipedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD77079P1'>The end of the Civil War, which began with the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House in April 1865, led to the largest number of military discharges. Once captured, Confederate forces became prisoners of war and parole did not formally discharge them from Confederate armies. As Union and Confederate troops demobilized, authorities moved to formally discharge troops. On June 6, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson ordered the discharge of most remaining Confederate prisoners of war, a process that took two months to complete. For the significant number of soldiers who returned home without going through formal discharge processes, they had difficulty proving they had been honorably discharged from the military, which was a core requirement for many veterans' benefits and membership in veterans' associations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32021662P0'>The United States Congress Third Reconstruction Act (1867), enacted in March of 1867, outlined terms for Confederate states' re-admittance to the Union by enacting the laws stated in the 14th Amendment. This was the third in a set of four Reconstruction Acts passed concerning the reentry of insurgent states following the Civil War and required each state reentering the Union to write a new constitution that guaranteed African American men the right to vote and hold office. It also mandated the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which guaranteed citizenship rights to all people born or naturalized in the United States and prohibited states from denying any person the equal protection of the laws. Many white southerners opposed the act, viewing it as an infringement on states' rights, but by 1870, all former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union under new Republican governments as outlined through this act.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

From November–December 1870 it suppressed Ku Klux Klan activities in Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Following Reconstruction, it served in the U.S. Indian Wars, and in later years, fought in the Spanish-American War, Philippine Insurrection, World War I, and World War II. In 1957 it was reorganized as a parent regiment under the Army’s Combat Arms Regimental System. (United States Army Center of Military History)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD95870P0'>A military headquarters is the main center of control for a unit and typically revolves around that unit’s highest ranking officer. The term headquarters often refers to a physical location, however it is not always a permanent facility. A commanding officer can establish a headquarters anywhere that best allows oversight of the unit. Frequently during the Civil War military leaders relocated their headquarters each day as their armies moved. Union general John Pope famously declared that he would make his “headquarters in the saddle.” The comment was more symbolic than literal, but reflected how a headquarters centered on the commander's location and was subject to his discretion in how and where to conduct official duties. Pope’s critics replied that he was making his headquarters where his “hindquarters” should be, representing the more traditional view of a headquarters being a stationary command center strategically located for the effective management of a staff and army.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD52163P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses advanced dramatically, though by 1900 it certainly still had far to go. In colonial America, mental illnesses were largely perceived as acts of God and thus inescapable and incurable. American society therefore dealt with people suffering from mental illnesses primarily through charitable organizations or benevolent societies like churches or almshouses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P1'>Throughout the nineteenth century, however, as the ideals of the Enlightenment continued to evolve, Americans developed a more institutional, scientific approach to understanding and treating mental illnesses as curable and in turn developing the field of psychiatry. Psychiatrists and state governments founded state-funded asylums to study and treat people with mental illnesses in isolation to prevent both interruption of treatment and danger to society. While nineteenth-century psychiatrists employed many terms no longer accepted to describe mental illnesses, and while the methods they employed in their asylums have likewise been largely dismissed, the study and treatment of mental illness in the United States advanced rapidly in the nineteenth century in tandem with greater societal and educational reforms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P2'>It is critical to note, however, that much of this advancement was aided by slavery. The Eastern Lunatic Asylum of Virginia, for example, relied on enslaved people as both patients and caregivers, and ideas about blackness and insanity were often mutually dependent. (Wendy Gonaver, The Peculiar Institution and the Making of Modern Psychiatry, 1840–1880).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P3'>One notable, and widespread, mental illness afflicting Americans in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries was the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) experienced by many Civil War veterans. While psychiatry had evolved over the century, its failure to diagnose and treat widespread PTSD glaringly reveals its limits (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 283-285).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32070324P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines the German nationality as "belonging to or relating to Germany, its language, or its people" (Cambridge Dictionary). Germans composed the largest group of immigrants to the United States in the nineteenth century. The largest wave of German immigration came in mid-century, due to increasing religious intolerance and a failed political revolution in 1848. While one study acknowledges that German immigrants largely avoided New England and the South, German immigrants settled throughout the nation. They settled most heavily in urban centers of the northeastern and midwestern United States, though a significant portion of the population chose to farm in rural areas of the Midwest and West. Nineteenth-century German Americans frequently lived in ethnically-based communities preserving German language, culture, and religious practices while developing a robust tradition of organizational and communal activities. German Americans also faced some of the fiercest resistance in the United States. The large number of German immigrants, particularly in cities, and their varied religious practices made them a target of nativists who distrusted Catholicism and feared that immigrant labor would render it difficult for native-born Americans to find work. German immigration considerably influenced the development of the American, or Know-Nothing, Party of the 1850s that devoted itself totally to anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic legislation. However, widespread German service in the American Civil War helped reduce nativism in the 1860s. Despite nativist discrimination, German Americans left a lasting mark on the social, political, and cultural traditions of the United States in the nineteenth century that reverberates today (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 77-81).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25023922P0'>Jewish people adhere to a monotheistic religion, worshipping one god, who revealed himself primarily to the prophets Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to a number of other prophets throughout history dating back to the ancient Middle East. The Jewish faith encompasses one's entire lifestyle, blending theology, law, and culture, including dietary restrictions limited to certain foods called kosher, all passed down through tradition and proscribed in the Hebrew Bible (Britannica).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25023922P1'>Jewish people have lived in Mississippi since the eighteenth century, but the first Jewish communities developed in the early nineteenth. The Jewish population in Mississippi, while never large, initially consisted of immigrants from Germany and, later in the nineteenth century, eastern Europeans. Many Jewish immigrants from Europe had little or no experience with agriculture, and thus earned their living primarily by business ownership or traveling sales. The Jewish community in Mississippi thereby played a large role in connecting Mississippi's farmers and their produce to larger world markets. Jewish people have faced discrimination throughout their history, including in the United States, the South, and in Mississippi. However, many Jewish people in the nineteenth century faced less discrimination in the South than in urban centers in the North, as many Jewish people embraced the predominant beliefs of southern white culture, leading many to fight for the Confederacy during the American Civil War (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)

              <value>From the Mississippi Department of Archives and History Governor Alcorn Collection. Report from P. B. Starke, Thos. W. Stinger, and T. J. Mitchell, members of a committee appointed to assess the affairs of the Mississippi State Penitentiary, to Mississippi Governor James L. Alcorn, containing the results of the committee&#39;s investigation into the condition of the penitentiary - including plantations leased by the penitentiary where some convicted persons, mostly African Americans, are made to perform labor - and its inmates. There are several pages of information concerning some inmates needing medical attention, some inmates whom the committee believed were improperly convicted, and recommended pardons or commutations of sentences. Appended are additional &quot;special reports&quot; concerning particular cases and persons.</value>
