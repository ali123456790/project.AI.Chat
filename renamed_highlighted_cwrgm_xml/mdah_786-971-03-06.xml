                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
