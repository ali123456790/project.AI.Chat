                    <p xml:id='OTPS32025288P0'>Rufus Brown Bullock was a businessman originally from New York who served as a Confederate officer and governor of Georgia during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025288P1'>Born on March 28, 1834, in Bethlehem, New York, Bullock graduated from Albion Academy in New York and became an expert in telegraphy. He began working for the American Telegraph Company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1855, then moved to Augusta, Georgia, to manage the Southern Express Company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025288P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Bullock opposed secession, but remained in Georgia and accepted an officer’s commission in the Confederate army to operate telegraph and railroad lines. After the war ended, he became active in politics as a Republican and supported Black civil rights in Georgia. He was elected governor in 1868 and used his office to promote racial equality under the law. He faced stubborn, and sometimes violent, opposition by conservative whites and white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan. Bullock frequently called for greater U.S. military enforcement of Reconstruction policies, in particular the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025288P3'>In 1870, facing severe criticism by white conservatives in Georgia, and following a significant Democratic victory in recent election, Bullock resigned his seat as governor and moved to New York. White supremacists in Georgia denounced him as corrupt, some calling him a “carpet bagger” (or northern opportunist who settled in the south during Reconstruction) despite his residency in Georgia since before the Civil War and his service to the Confederacy. In 1876, Bullock returned to Georgia and faced trial for corruption and fraud. He was found not guilty, which helped reestablish his reputation in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025288P4'>Bullock lived in Atlanta during the last two decades of the nineteenth century, finding success as president of a cotton mill, as an executive in the English-American Loan Company, and through various positions in clubs and advisory boards in Atlanta and other parts of Georgia. He moved back to New York in 1903 and died there in 1907. Bullock was married to Marie Salisbury and had at least three children. He is buried in Mount Albion Cemetery in Albion, New York.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD93443P0'>During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen British colonies in North American fought for, and won, their independence from the British Empire, creating the United States of America. It began with years of political and ideological tension over British policies, often related to the relationship between taxation and political rights and representation. Colonists objected not simply to the financial burden of tax acts, but their lack of representation within the British government making such policies. Protests within the colonies in the 1760s and early 1770s began to challenge British authority overall, and colonial leaders and writers found inspiration from Enlightenment principles of constitutionalism and consent of the governed. The First Continental Congress, made up of representatives from each colony, met in September 1774 to unite colonial responses to British policies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93443P1'>The first formal shots of the war broke out in April 1775 at Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, when British military forces attempted to disarm colonists deemed to be in rebellion. Shortly afterwards, in June 1775, the Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and created a Continental Army, with George Washington as commander-in-chief. Though escalating the conflict, these actions were not formal attempts to separate from the British Empire.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93443P2'>That changed in July 1776, when the Second Continental Congress declared independence from Great Britain. This effort was famously announced in the Declaration of Independence, primarily authored by Virginia representative Thomas Jefferson, under the justification that “all men are created equal,” and the natural right of revolution from tyrannical oppression. Colonial delegates approved the Declaration on July 4, 1776, marking that day as the symbolic birth of the United States of America.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93443P3'>Over the next seven years, the American Continental army struggled against a more powerful British military across North America. However, key battlefield victories, as well as vital support from France—particularly naval ships—boosted American success. Overall, though, the war was one of attrition and time. Although many colonists remained loyal to King George III, British military forces could not destroy the Continental Army and their tactical victories did not reinstitute loyalty among the Americans. This was exacerbated by some British officials, who enacted controversial policies, such as Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, who declared martial law and offered freedom to African American slaves of rebelling Virginians who fled bondage and and joined the British Army. Over the course of the war, British forces frequently found themselves isolated and in 1781, American and French troops surrounded and captured a key British army at Yorktown, Virginia, effectively ending British military actions.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93443P4'>On September 3, 1783, the British government signed the Treaty of Paris, acknowledging the independence of the thirteen colonies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93443P5'>The American Revolutionary War not only established independence of the North American colonies, leading to the creation of the United States of America, but enshrined certain Enlightenment and Revolutionary principles within American society. The war formally broke the idea of fealty to monarchy, or aristocracy, and championed principles of equality and self-governance. Those principles helped spark new anti-slavery sentiments. particularly in northern states where slavery was less entrenched. This led to laws against slavery in existing northern states and northern territories, but also led to increasing sectional tension over the matter of slavery in the United States. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25015582P0'>Operating at the state level, the Office of the Secretary of State of Georgia was established in 1777. It is an office within the Executive Department and headed by the Secretary of State. The Secretary is responsible for keeping the state seal and flag, overseeing statewide elections, and managing public records. Until 1880 the Secretary was elected by the State Legislature but is now publicly elected and their term in office is four years. (New Georgia Encyclopedia; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
