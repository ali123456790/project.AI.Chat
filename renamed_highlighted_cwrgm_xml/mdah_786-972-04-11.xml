                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63506P0'>Primary and secondary education in the nineteenth-century United States varied greatly by region and economic class. Prior to the Civil War and Reconstruction, the United States had no centralized educational system, relying primarily on state and even municipal authorities to ensure that students received an education. In rural areas, particularly in northeastern states prizing education as necessary to republican government, many local communities developed the earliest forms of public education known as "district schools" that taught boys and girls alike for free. In urban areas, public and private schools (also divided by religious denomination) often competed, with public schools serving lower-income students and private schools serving wealthy ones (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 1, 396).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63506P1'>After the American Revolution, girls and women were encouraged to attend schools and receive educations, yet their roles in so doing remained divided based on gender. Nineteenth century Americans viewed women's place in the home, and women's education was widely accepted as a way for them to pass that education on to their children. The nineteenth century therefore saw more opportunities for girls to become students, yet still in a discriminated way. Prior to the Civil War, most schools, though co-educational were either segregated or, in the South, completely prohibitive to African Americans. However, during Reconstruction, the Freedmen's Bureau established over 3,000 schools for African American children between 1865 and 1869 (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 1, 412). Even after the legalization of and widespread efforts at educating African Americans, education in the United States remained deeply segregated, with inferior funding and resources provided to African American schools - a system entrenched during the Jim Crow era of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Consequently, the United States, and particularly the South, was slow to adopt universal, state-sponsored primary and secondary education, and what did exist remained marred by deep divisions of race, class, and gender.

<p corresp='TTP32787738P5' xml:id='OTP32787738P5'>The District I represent on the Board comprises an area extending some twenty miles North &amp; South by seven or Eight miles in breadth—There are some portions of this Sub-District in which there are not twenty children of Educable age and yet they are too remote from other centers to obtain the benefit of School with any degree of convenience—A strict construction of the law deprives them of the use and ben-efit of the fund—I think the true spirit and intent of the law gives them the right to the uses and benefits intended—

So that Either all, or a portion of the children of some neighborhoods would be excluded from school—which I am confident the Law does not contemplate, <del rend='overstrike'>but</del> yet such is the letter of the law—There are also children living immediately on or near the County line, too remote from schools in their own district, but conveniently contig-uous to schools in the adjoining Counties—A strict con-struction of the law would exclude them also, as each child is required to attend school in his own district—There is very little discretionary power given to the District Boards, and if they administer the law strictly according to its letter, and not according to its spirit and in-tent, there will necessarily arise much dissatisfaction
