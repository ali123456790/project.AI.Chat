                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32027132P0'>Alexander Gallatin McNutt was a lawyer, politician, writer, and Governor of Mississippi from 1838 to 1842. Born on January 3, 1802 in Rockbridge County, Virginia, McNutt moved to Jackson and then Vicksburg, Mississippi in the early 1820s where he practiced law. Following the murder of his partner Joel Cameron, McNutt married Elizabeth Ann (Lewis) (Cameron) in 1834. The two do not appear to have had any children. McNutt was also accused of instigating some of Cameron's enslaved men to commit the murder but was never charged. In the 1830s, McNutt became active as a politician. He was elected into the Mississippi state senate in 1835 and was elected Governor of Mississippi in 1837, serving two terms. After leaving office, he returned to his law practice and unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate. McNutt died on October 22, 1848 in DeSoto County, Mississippi. He is buried in the Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS53994P0'>Albert Gallatin Brown was governor of Mississippi, a U.S. congressman and senator from Mississippi, and a member of the Confederate Senate. Born on May 31, 1813, in South Carolina, Brown moved with his family to Mississippi in 1823. Over the course of ten years, Brown’s family established a cotton plantation that contained 1,600 acres of land and 23 slaves. He attended Mississippi College and Jefferson College, and studied law to become a practicing attorney in 1834. A year later, he entered politics, winning a seat in Mississippi’s House of Representatives in 1835 and then serving in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1839 to 1841. He was a judge in Mississippi’s Circuit Superior Court from 1842 to 1843 and then, at the age of 31, won Mississippi’s gubernatorial election in 1843 as a Democrat. Brown was a staunch advocate of public education and successfully established the University of Mississippi, which opened in 1848.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P1'>Brown left the governor’s mansion in 1848 and returned to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served there until winning a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1854. He was an outspoken defender of slavery in Washington, D.C., in the latter half of the 1850s, even advocating the expansion of American slavery to Central America. When Mississippi seceded in 1861, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, Brown resigned his seat in the Senate and returned to Mississippi to organize a militia company. He led his unit to Virginia, but was shortly afterwards elected to represent Mississippi in the Confederate Senate. He remained a member there until the end of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P2'>Brown was among a small number of Confederate officials who foresaw the fall of the Confederacy in the wake of the battlefield defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. He unsuccessfully recommended a negotiated settlement with the Union. When the war ended in 1865, Brown took a more reconciliatory stance to Reconstruction than many other former Confederates, recommending that the south accept emancipation. Despite having a political career during a controversial and dangerous period in American history, Brown was described as being among the most amicable and fair public figures, refusing to castigate or criticize his political opponents.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P3'>After the Civil War, Brown left public life. He practiced law in Mississippi for the next fifteen years. Brown was married twice during his life, first to Elizabeth Frances Thornton Taliaferro, who died less than a year after their wedding. His second wife was Roberta Eugenia Young. The couple had one child.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS53994P4'>Brown died of a stroke on June 12, 1880, at home in Mississippi. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS72945P0'>John Jones McRae was a lawyer and statesman from Mississippi who served in the Mississippi House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, as the 21st Governor of Mississippi, and the Confederate Congress.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P1'>McRae was born on January 10, 1815 in Sneedsboro (present-day McFarlan), Anson County, North Carolina. At age two, his family moved to Winchester, Wayne County, Mississippi in 1817 and later to Pascagoula, Jackson County, Mississippi in 1827. He attended the University of Miami in Ohio, graduating in 1834. McRae returned to Mississippi to study law at Pearlington. He was admitted to the bar in 1835 and began practicing law in Paulding, Mississippi. In October 1835 he married Mary Annette McGuire, and the couple had three children together. He founded the newspaper <hi rend='italic'>Eastern Clarion</hi> in 1837.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P2'>McRae’s political career began when he was elected as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1847, serving as Speaker of the House in 1850. He was appointed to the United States Senate from December 19, 1851 until March 17, 1852 to serve the remainder of Jefferson Davis’s unexpired term when he resigned to run for Governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P3'>In 1853 McRae was elected as the 21st Governor of Mississippi under the Democratic States’ Rights platform. He was reelected in 1855. During his time in the Governorship McRae’s administration oversaw the opening of the state’s first mental hospital and established an asylum for the deaf and speechless. He also oversaw the State’s levy program in the Delta and signed the Mississippi Code of 1857 into law. McRae was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1858 following the death of Congressman John A. Quitman. He served in Congress until January 12, 1861, resigning his seat three days after Mississippi seceded from the Union. He was elected to the Confederate Congress and served from 1862 to 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS72945P4'>McRae was not involved in public affairs after the Civil War. His wife Mary died in 1866. In 1868 he sailed to Belize (present-day Belize City), British Honduras (Present-day Belize) to visit his brother. While there he died unexpectedly on May 31, 1868. He is buried at Lord Ridge Cemetery, Belize City, Belize.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32083483P0'>In the early 1800s, Mississippi chartered its banks to meet the needs of the quickly growing cotton industry. This included setting up branches, which was an innovative idea at the time. There was resistance to a national bank, and Mississippi had insufficient banking infrastructure for its booming cotton economy. In the 1830s, the state relaxed its banking regulations and chartered many new banks quickly, leading to speculation and risky lending practices. This, along with federal policies, contributed to the Panic of 1837. Mississippi even resorted to issuing unconstitutional bonds to fund a bank, Union Bank, which ultimately failed. The state's credit was ruined. The Civil War devastated Mississippi's banking system. Due to the war and the shift from a slave-based to a free-labor economy, existing banks collapsed or became unreliable. The National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864, which established a national banking system, offered little help to Mississippi as the high capital requirements for these banks made them inaccessible to the state. Local merchants filled the gap by offering credit to planters based on the cotton crop. The number of banks grew rapidly in the late 19th century, largely due to out-of-state funds from northern banks and financial houses. The Mississippi Bankers Association was formed in 1889 to promote responsible banking practices. ("Banking," Mississippi Encyclopedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P0'>The United States <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 as the foundational code of laws for the United States of America. It was crafted in 1787 by a convention in Philadelphia originally tasked only with amending the existing <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi>, which had loosely combined the states under a weak central government. Delegates chose to set aside the articles entirely and create a stronger federal government made of three branches: the legislative (comprising two separate parts, the House of Representatives and the Senate), the judicial (led by the Supreme Court), and the executive (headed by the President of the United States). The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> sought to carefully balance competing interests regarding state and national authority, as well as large and small state representation. It also created a more direct relationship between Americans and the national government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P1'>The convention’s departure from its original mandate to amend the <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi> generated controversy, particularly among Americans who opposed placing a distant central authority of the states. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters advocated the need for a stronger national government and explained that the federal system preserved state authority for most local matters. To guarantee enough support for ratification, the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters agreed to add an addendum to more directly protect individuals' specific rights and freedoms. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 and the new United States government began in early 1789. Shortly afterwards, the new Congress adopted several amendments to the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>, ten of which were ratified by three-fourths of the states and became known as the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments guaranteed certain rights for American citizens. Since then, seventeen additional amendments have been ratified to the United States Constitution. Three of them—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments—were adopted between 1865 and 1870, during the Reconstruction Era. The Thirteenth Amendment formally abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment provides equal protection for all laws and the Fifteenth Amendment protects voting rights for American citizens regardless of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” both specifically to combat racial discrimination against African Americans following the end of slavery.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32031783P0'>Ratified in 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen’s right to vote according to race, skin color, or previous condition of servitude. It was the third, and last, of the Reconstruction amendments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32031783P1'>The Thirteenth Amendment, ratified in 1865, formally abolished slavery in the United States. That amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment—which was ratified in 1868 and guaranteed citizenship and equal protect of people regardless of race—did not directly protect Black voting rights. While Black citizens in some states and territories did enjoy the right to vote, millions of African Americans in former slave states were barred from the ballot box. To better ensure suffrage among African Americans across the country, Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. However, President Andrew Johnson had vetoed the Civil Rights Act. Although Congress overrode the veto, opposition to the bill and doubts by even some of its supporters that the act would survive judicial review led to an effort to protect Black voting with a Constitutional amendment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32031783P2'>Initial language for the Fifteenth Amendment protected a far larger set of factors, including race, color, nativity, property, education, and religious beliefs. This was pared down by nativist representatives, especially from the north, from districts with strong anti-immigrant sentiments, and some Republican officials who feared that such a sweeping protection of voting rights could enable former Confederates to regain voting rights far more quickly than Reconstruction policies allowed. The final text also made no mention of certain voting restrictions, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, used by conservative white officials in the south to restrict Black voting. The Fifteenth Amendment also did not explicitly protect the right of African Americans to run for political office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32031783P3'>Resistance to the Fifteenth Amendment’s ratification also came from some female suffragists. Before the Civil War, many women’s rights advocates worked alongside abolitionists for equal rights. Some women objected to the amendment’s emphasis on voting rights according to race without similar protections for women. This argument even split some female rights groups among those who supported the amendment and those who opposed it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32031783P4'>Many western, New England, and deep south states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment shortly after its passage through Congress in 1869. New England had been the traditional home of progressive social movements like abolitionism and suffrage, and the deep south was still largely controlled by Republican officials for Reconstruction. The amendment went into effect after Iowa ratified it in February 1870. Most of the last states to ratify it were the former border states during the Civil War—which had largely conservative state governments and were not under federal control during Reconstruction.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73894P0'>In the United States in the nineteenth century, most college students, with few exceptions, were white males from elite families. Few universities admitted women or African Americans. The nation's earliest universities were established by Christian denominations, but college education, however, often served as much to provide social and cultural capital for aspiring social elites as much as practical knowledge (Roger L. Geiger, <hi rend='italic'>The History of American Higher Education</hi>, 267). From their findings throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, American universities exposed college students primarily to classical liberal arts curricula, including classical languages, logic, and the natural sciences, though that education expanded to broader subjects throughout the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73894P1'>Many colleges and universities, especially but not exclusively in the South, built their schools and supported their white student populations with enslaved labor. In many universities in slave states, students brought enslaved persons with them to universities. American colleges and universities, as well as their students, therefore profited from the enslaved labor of African Americans while institutionalizing educational and wealth inequality between white and Black Americans as well as between men and women of both races. However, other colleges, such as Oberlin College in Ohio, admitted women and African Americans even in the antebellum period.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73894P2'>In 1862, the Morrill Land Grant Act set aside federal property to be used to establish colleges devoted to agricultural and mechanical studies, broadening both the student population and curriculum of American universities. After Emancipation, many African Americans established colleges and universities across the nation, now known as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to increase Black Americans' access to higher education, though the full integration of higher education in the nation would not come until a century later during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s (Roger L. Geiger, <hi rend='italic'>The History of American Higher Education</hi>; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25011749P0'>A power of attorney is "the legal right to act for someone else in their financial or business matters, or the document that gives you this right" (Cambridge Dictionary). Power of attorney can be granted for numerous and varied reasons, generally to those whose relatives or legal dependents are deemed incapable of managing their own affairs due to disability, age, or other factors. Power of attorney privileges in the nineteenth-century United States most often had negative effects on women. American law placed men at the head of their households, and at marriage a woman's political and legal identity  was subsumed into her husband's in a process known as "coverture." While not technically a power of attorney agreement, this arrangement provided the same practical powers and granted men full control of their wives' property, finances, and often, in the case of divorce, custody of children. Powers of attorney in the nineteenth-century U. S. therefore highlight the level of legally protected patriarchal authority exercised by men North and South (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol.1, 533-537).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
