                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32099145P0'>A bar association is a professional association of attorneys, often responsible for regulating the legal practices and standards in their communities. The use of the word “bar” is tied to the traditional presence of a railing in court room to separate court proceeding from the public viewing area. In the United States, bar association requirements vary. Most are now organized as corporations. Many states require lawyers to be members of a respective bar association to practice law. Attorneys typically must pass bar exams to demonstrate proficiency in their state’s laws, regulations, and legal practices for admission to a bar association. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32070343P0'>In the legal profession, the term “bar” is often used to describe a body of lawyers. Some sources say the reference originates from the use of a railing to separate students from professionals in early law schools; other accounts claim the term referred to the banister within courtrooms that attorneys stood alongside while pleading a case. Regardless of the term’s exact origin, attorneys who were part of the bar were recognized as respected lawyers by their peers. Due to variations in laws across the United States, attorneys tended to practice in specific districts, and membership within a bar was most often tied to the body of lawyers in that county or city, such as the Memphis bar. During the nineteenth century, attorneys in some American communities began to create bar associations, which were professional organizations designed to improve education and standards among lawyers. However, these associations primarily emerged after Reconstruction. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32070344P0'>While Americans and the various German states had friendly relations at the creation of the United States, much of the early diplomatic work was informal, through intermediaries, or involved temporary appointments. Formal diplomatic relations began in 1835, when the United States sent its first permanent diplomat to the Kingdom of Prussia. When revolution broke out in the German states in the late 1840s, the U.S. was the only major country to recognize the National Assembly in Frankfort, before it was defeated. The German government remained neutral during the American Civil War, but generally favored the Union. Most German immigrants to the United States settled in the north, and thousands of native-born or second generation Germans served in the Union Army. The U.S. Consul General in Germany successfully blocked efforts by Confederate diplomats to borrow money from German governments, and facilitated trade agreements that boosted the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32070344P1'>The new German Empire that emerged in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War, established a new embassy in Washington, D.C. New consulates opened in other major American cities, and relations between Germany and the United States remained positive. The American minister to Germany, George Bancroft, proved especially effective in maintaining positive relations between the two countries. This positive relationship did not fundamentally change until the early twentieth century, as Germany became more aggressive in foreign affairs and then entangled in the First World War. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P0'>A Unionist was "a member or supporter of the twenty-three Northern states that were not part of the seceding Confederacy during the American Civil War" (Wikipedia). Unionism in the South took on a variety of forms and encompassed many different beliefs. While most northerners sided with the Union, many southerners did as well. Even prior to secession, no solid white South existed, as many white southerners in mountainous and upcountry areas of the South did not own enslaved persons. While some areas like eastern Tennessee and parts of northern Alabama rejected secession outright for the entire war, secession produced renewed patriotism for many non-enslaving whites in the South. That patriotism faltered for many as the awful realities of wartime violence and poverty struck even as early as 1861. Many poor white southerners viewed the Confederacy's conscription, impressment, and taxation policies as elitist, forcing many families to, if not support the Union per se, at least oppose the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25024541P1'>Entire unionist communities developed throughout the war to shield those loyal to the Union or opposed to the Confederacy, as well as deserters from the Confederate Army and, in certain cases, escaped enslaved persons. Southern unionism often led to internal armed conflict between southerners, as bands of guerilla fighters raided Confederate depots and shipping for supplies and even attacked some Confederate units. While unionist strongholds most frequently developed in the mountainous regions of the South and the border states, Unionism spread throughout the entire Confederacy, including one of the most notable in Jones County, Mississippi, where ex-Confederate soldier Newton Knight and roughly 500 others formed the so-called "Free State of Jones" and opposed Confederate forces until the war's end. The presence of Unionism across the South stifled the Confederate war effort in many ways and revealed that tensions of national loyalty, race, class, and gender remained complicated even for southern whites (American Heritage; Essential Civil War Curriculum).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32070324P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines the German nationality as "belonging to or relating to Germany, its language, or its people" (Cambridge Dictionary). Germans composed the largest group of immigrants to the United States in the nineteenth century. The largest wave of German immigration came in mid-century, due to increasing religious intolerance and a failed political revolution in 1848. While one study acknowledges that German immigrants largely avoided New England and the South, German immigrants settled throughout the nation. They settled most heavily in urban centers of the northeastern and midwestern United States, though a significant portion of the population chose to farm in rural areas of the Midwest and West. Nineteenth-century German Americans frequently lived in ethnically-based communities preserving German language, culture, and religious practices while developing a robust tradition of organizational and communal activities. German Americans also faced some of the fiercest resistance in the United States. The large number of German immigrants, particularly in cities, and their varied religious practices made them a target of nativists who distrusted Catholicism and feared that immigrant labor would render it difficult for native-born Americans to find work. German immigration considerably influenced the development of the American, or Know-Nothing, Party of the 1850s that devoted itself totally to anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic legislation. However, widespread German service in the American Civil War helped reduce nativism in the 1860s. Despite nativist discrimination, German Americans left a lasting mark on the social, political, and cultural traditions of the United States in the nineteenth century that reverberates today (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 77-81).
