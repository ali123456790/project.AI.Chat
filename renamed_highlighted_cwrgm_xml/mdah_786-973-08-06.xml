                    <p xml:id='OTPS94280P0'>James L. Alcorn served as governor and then U.S. senator for Mississippi in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P1'>Born November 4, 1816, in Illinois Territory, Alcorn spent much of his young adulthood in Kentucky. After attending Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, Alcorn was deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky, and then entered legal practice in the state in the 1830s. He served a short stint in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the early 1840s and then relocated to Mississippi, where he practiced law in Coahoma County. Financial success as an attorney enabled Alcorn to buy land and establish Mound Place Plantation in the Mississippi Delta region. By 1860, Alcorn owned nearly one hundred slaves; his land holdings alone were valued at approximately $9.5 million in today’s currency. Alcorn married Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky in 1839. The couple had five children before Mary passed away in 1849. Alcorn married Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama in 1850. He fathered three children with his second wife.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P2'>Alcorn was a Unionist during the 1850s. He served as a delegate to a special Mississippi convention to debate the south’s response to the Compromise of 1850—legislation passed in the U.S. Congress designed to settle a fierce dispute over the fate of slavery in territories gained by the United States from Mexico. He warned that secession would lead to war, with federal soldiers invading the south, liberating slaves, and a destroying southern society. Alcorn and other Unionists carried the day during the 1851 convention.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P3'>During the 1850s, Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate as a Whig. He led a legislative effort to establish levees to reduce flooding in the Delta region, and was elected the first president of the levee board. As his standing in Mississippi politics increased, he ran for election to U.S. Congress in 1856 but lost. Whigs in Mississippi subsequently considered him for a gubernatorial run in 1857, but Alcorn turned it down.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P4'>During the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the U.S. presidency in 1860, Alcorn initially maintained his Unionist leanings. However, when Mississippi issued its ordnance of secession, Alcorn pledged his loyalty to the state and volunteered for military service in Mississippi. He received an appointment as brigadier general for the state militia in 1861, but his military advancement was hindered by powerful political rivals.  Alcorn led a brigade of three Mississippi militia regiments into the field in October 1861. His brigade spent three months Kentucky—experiencing miserable weather and mud, but no combat—before disbanding in January 1862 when their enlistments expired.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P5'>Alcorn returned home from Kentucky embittered and embroiled in disputes with his personal and political rivals. Although he backed Mississippi following secession, Alcorn was not particularly committed to the Confederate cause. After federal soldiers entered Mississippi in 1862, his plantation was among those raided. However, Alcorn established contacts within the Union army and began trading cotton with federal authorities against Confederate policy. As a result, his wealth grew and his plantation was spared the same level of destruction meted out to notable secessionists.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P6'>Alcorn reentered Mississippi politics immediately upon the defeat of the Confederacy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865 by the postwar Mississippi government’s effort to earn readmission into the Union under President Andrew Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction plan. However, the Mississippi legislature passed a series of highly discriminatory laws (known as the Black Codes) against recently emancipated African Americans, prompting Republicans in the United States Congress to refuse Mississippi back into the Union. As a result, Alcorn was denied his seat in the Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P7'>Alcorn became a leading member of the Republican Party in Mississippi as Reconstruction developed. He embraced Black civil rights, including African American suffrage. Although born in the north, his long residency in, and service to, Mississippi before and during the Civil War made him a “scalawag” (white southerner who joined the Republican Party) to conservative whites in the south. Nevertheless, he gained enough political support to win the Republican nomination for governor and then the gubernatorial election in 1869 as Mississippi reentered the Union. He entered office in 1870 and oversaw the development of a state public education system, the creation of a land-grant college for African Americans (named Alcorn University in his honor), and pro-business acts to improve economic development in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P8'>Alcorn resigned as governor in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi. Though still a Republican, Alcorn represented a more conservative side of the party. Though supporting Black civil rights, he resisted some federal intervention in Mississippi affairs, and generally held white supremacist views. This put him in opposition to the other senator from Mississippi, Adelbert Ames, a former Union general who had served as a military governor in Reconstruction Mississippi and led the more radical faction of Republicans in Mississippi that pushed total racial equality. Alcorn and Ames ran against each other for governor of Mississippi in 1873. Ames won by carrying most African American votes.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS94280P9'>Alcorn left the U.S. Senate in 1877 and returned to Mississippi. He did not take part in most state political matters, but did stay active in the levee system and governing. In 1890, he was selected to be a delegate to the Mississippi constitutional convention. He was among the delegates the supported new restrictions against Black Mississippi rights.  Alcorn died on December 19, 1894. He is buried in Friars Point, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P0'>At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, neither the Union nor the Confederate army struggled to find recruits. Rather, both armies saw far more volunteers than their ranks and provisions could sustain. Many young men of the North and South believed that the war would end quickly and volunteered by the thousands to not miss out on the action. Other motivators for rapid enlistment included a sense of adventure, defense of slavery or the privileges of whiteness, defense of the Union, fear of ostracism in their home communities for not enlisting, or a desire to protect their homes and families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P1'>Widespread enlistment required both the United States and Confederate governments to reshape their militaries that were otherwise unprepared to handle that many recruits. The U.S. possessed only a small standing army of 16,000 men before the war, and the Confederacy needed to build its own from scratch. Both therefore relied heavily on local recruiting to organize men into militia companies then employable in the federal service. Recruiters throughout the war published pamphlets, put up posters, and gave speeches to encourage men to fight.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P2'>As the war continued, dreams of a short war ended along with many men's desires to enlist. Both armies (the Confederacy in 1862 and the Union in 1863) resorted to conscription to fill their ranks. Free African Americans, particularly in the North, debated the utility and wisdom of fighting for the United States even after being legally allowed to do so in 1863. Many formerly enslaved African-American men yearned to fight for their own freedom, while others doubted that military service in the Civil War would accomplish their desired goals of emancipation and equality. However, prominent African Americans such as Frederick Douglass encouraged Black men to take up arms, and roughly 200,000 did so.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25009156P3'>Ultimately, men enlisted during the Civil War for many reasons, often tied to demographic or personal causes, and, as the war progressed and varied in its popularity and aims, recruiters' tactics likewise changed to adapt to each new situation. (Encyclopedia of Arkansas)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32099145P0'>A bar association is a professional association of attorneys, often responsible for regulating the legal practices and standards in their communities. The use of the word “bar” is tied to the traditional presence of a railing in court room to separate court proceeding from the public viewing area. In the United States, bar association requirements vary. Most are now organized as corporations. Many states require lawyers to be members of a respective bar association to practice law. Attorneys typically must pass bar exams to demonstrate proficiency in their state’s laws, regulations, and legal practices for admission to a bar association. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32070398P0'>In the legal profession, the term “bar” is often used to describe a body of lawyers. Some sources say the reference originates from the use of a railing to separate students from professionals in early law schools; other accounts claim the term referred to the banister within courtrooms that attorneys stood alongside while pleading a case. Regardless of the term’s exact origin, attorneys who were part of the bar were recognized as respected lawyers by their peers. Due to variations in laws across the United States, membership within a bar was most often tied to the body of lawyers within a state, such as the Mississippi bar.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32070398P1'>During the nineteenth century, attorneys in some American communities began to create bar associations, which were professional organizations designed to improve education and standards among lawyers. A small group of lawyers in Mississippi tried to establish a statewide association 1821, but it dissolved after four years. A second effort to create a state bar association took place in 1886, but it too fell apart after a short period. The current Mississippi Bar Association successfully began in 1906.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63104P0'>The Whig Party was a national political party in the United States from 1833 to 1860. During its roughly twenty-five years of existence, it stood as one of two major political parties (the other being the Democratic Party) that dominated American national politics. Four U.S. presidents were elected as Whig candidates, and several leading American congressmen and statesmen identified as Whigs. The party generally opposed aggressive American expansion westward, and denounced the Mexican War. Whigs supported protective tariffs, federal support for infrastructure, and the national bank.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63104P1'>The Whig Party, like the Democratic Party, had members across the United States. It struggled to remain united during debates over slavery. Northern Whigs tended to be more hostile to slavery than northern Democrats, and the overtly anti-slavery parties, such as the Free Soil Party, in the late 1840s and early 1850s were primarily made up of former Whigs. After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved restrictions against slavery in the territories, thousands of northern Whigs, disgruntled northern Democrats, and Free Soil members formed the Republican Party as a major national political organization. The Whig Party remained cohesive enough to put a candidate on the 1856 presidential ballot, but the results of that election proved that the Republican Party had supplanted the Whigs in political power. The Whig Party fell apart over the next few years, in large part because Republicans adopted many of the Whig Party’s economic policies. Conservative Whigs in the south tried to inhabit a middle ground during the contentious 1860 presidential debate by forming the Constitutional Union Party that opposed secession and avoided taking sides on the slavery debate. This effort meant the end of the Whig Party as a viable party in American politics. (Wikipedia)
