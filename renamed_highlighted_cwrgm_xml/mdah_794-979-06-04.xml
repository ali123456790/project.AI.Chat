                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077064P0'>Julius Junkermann was a Republican public figure and private secretary to a governor in Reconstruction Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P1'>Born on November 14, 1841, in Dusseldorf, Germany, Junkermann moved to the United States in 1860, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the Civil War broke out the following year, he was forced into Confederate service. He reportedly deserted the Confederate army at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, and fled to Union lines, where he volunteered for service. He enlisted in the Forty-third Illinois Infantry Regiment and served in the Union army for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P2'>Junkermann resided in Mississippi after the war and was active in Republican Party politics. He married Clara Eggleston, the daughter of Brevet (honorary) Brigadier General Beroth B. Eggleston, a Union officer originally who helped establish the Republican Party in Mississippi during Reconstruction and unsuccessfully ran for governor of the state in the late 1860s. Junkermann and his wife had one daughter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P3'>Junkermann served as Superintendent of Public Education in Washington County, Mississippi, in the early 1870s before becoming Governor Ridgley Powers’s private secretary in 1872. He was commissioned as Quartermaster General, at the rank of brigadier general, in the Mississippi State Militia in January 1872 and served a wide variety of public offices over the next several years, including circuit court clerk in Washington County and U.S. deputy tax collector in Jackson, Mississippi. Junkermann was also nominated for Mississippi state legislature in 1875, but does not appear to have won.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P4'>Junkermann, his wife, and much of his wife’s family, moved to Kansas around 1879, after Reconstruction had ended in the south. He edited a German-language newspaper in Kansas and served as justice of the peace for several years. In the early 1880s, Junkermann experienced unspecified health problems. He traveled to Colorado for treatment in 1883, but his condition worsened and he returned home only a few days later and died on June 1, 1883, in Wichita, Kansas. He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS54036P0'>Nathan Bedford Forrest was a Confederate cavalry commander and later the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P1'>Born on July 13, 1821, in Bedford County, Tennessee, he became his family’s caretaker at age sixteen when his father died. He pursued numerous types of business as a young man, including gambling, farming, and slave trading. When the Civil War began in 1861, Forrest was one of the wealthiest men in the south, owning more than three thousand acres in Mississippi, as well as plantations in Tennessee and Arkansas.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P2'>He volunteered for Confederate service in 1861 and soon received command of the Third Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. He had no formal military training—and little formal education—yet, proved a natural leader and military tactician. He scored numerous military victories as a cavalry commander, and showed skill in avoiding capture or defeat by Union troops. In February 1862, when Ulysses S. Grant’s troops besieged Confederate troops at Fort Donelson, Forrest led nearly four thousand southern soldiers in escaping across the Cumberland River before the fort fell to the federal units. During the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi in 1863, Forrest was a brigadier general leading Confederate raids on Grant’s supply lines, causing havoc and frustrating federal efforts to stop his cavalry force.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P3'>By 1864, Forrest had been promoted to major general. He continued to see great success in raids behind Union lines and through mounting attacks against smaller contingents of Union soldiers. In April 1864, he led Confederate troops against a federal garrison at Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Forrest’s men overran the fort and, according to many witness accounts, began murdering Black Union soldiers who had surrendered to the Confederates. The event became one of the most famous atrocities of the Civil War, widely publicized and investigated by federal officials.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P4'>While much of the Confederacy’s military future grew dim in 1864, as William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union army advanced upon Atlanta, and Grant’s Union forces backed Robert E. Lee into a defensive position around Richmond, Virginia, Forrest remained mobile and dangerous, scoring notable victories even when outnumbered, such as the Battle of Brice’s Cross Roads in June 1864 in Mississippi. He was promoted to lieutenant general in February 1865, and remained in the field until April 1865, when he surrendered to Union forces in the wake of the Confederacy’s collapse. By the time the Civil War ended, Forrest had been wounded four times, reportedly had twenty-nine horses shot out from under him, and claimed to have killed or defeated thirty Union soldiers in hand-to-hand combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P5'>Following the war, Forrest lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and pursued a career in railroad development. His ventures ultimately were not successful, and he was nearly bankrupt. He moved onto a large plantation on the Mississippi River that used convicts for labor, in a system similar to slavery. Apart from his financial efforts, Forrest’s early postwar activities involved a prominent role in the Ku Klux Klan. Elected the terror organization’s first Grand Wizard in 1867. He helped recruit former Confederates and white southern men to the group as an effort to resist Reconstruction and Republican policies. However, Forrest became disenchanted with the lack of order and discipline he saw during the Klan’s its rapid expansion. In 1869, he tried to dissolve the Klan and ordered its members to destroy their robes and hoods. By the mid-1870s, Forrest began making public speeches advocating for better protection of Black civil rights. These actions caused rebuke from many of his former Confederate colleagues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS54036P6'>Forrest died of diabetes October 29, 1877. He was married to Mary Ann Montgomery and had two children. Forrest was initially buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Then, in 1904, city officials moved his remains (and those of his wife) to a city park named in his honor. In 2021, his remains were moved again, this time to Columbia, Tennessee.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P0'>When the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, it failed to abolish involuntary servitude. The amendment included a loophole banning involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted" (Library of Congress). White southerners in the post-emancipation South, concerned about both the availability of labor and the freedom of African Americans, manipulated this clause and turned to convict leasing to entrench long standing racial hierarchies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P1'>Immediately after the war, many states passed "Black Codes" or laws severely limiting African Americans' rights. Under these codes and other similar laws passed in the decades following the Civil War, African Americans could be arrested for any number of petty crimes, including vagrancy (functionally construed to mean any act of social mobility not approved by a white person) or theft (in Mississippi a felony if exceeding $10 worth of goods). Widespread racism and stereotypes about Black criminality led to a dramatic expansion in the population of imprisoned individuals and an overwhelming number of African Americans within that population. Many states leased those convicted persons to private companies or individuals for their labor, and in certain cases lessees had been the pre-emancipation enslaver of the leased.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P2'>Laborers worked in a variety of settings including shipbuilding and timber cutting, yet the most prominent form in states like Mississippi remained large-scale agricultural work. The convict lease system was incredibly dangerous and difficult for those who lived through it, as leased persons faced unsafe working conditions, inadequate living conditions, abuse from lessees, and grueling work schedules. Given these circumstances, the ready availability of imprisoned laborers, and the callousness of lessees and state officials, the mortality rate among convict laborers was incredibly high.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P3'>Certain states ceased leasing imprisoned persons to individuals or private companies in the late nineteenth century, only to continue using that labor on state-funded infrastructure projects like road or highway construction until, in some cases, World War II. Southern individuals and states thereby continued to increase their wealth through the coerced labor of African Americans while perpetuating anti-Black racism and laying the foundations of the modern prison-industrial complex (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P0'>In the wake of the Civil War, many states turned to convict leasing to bolster infrastructural repair and to maintain long standing racial hierarchies. Like many other southern states, Mississippi instituted a convict leasing program, and in 1876 the state passed the Leasing Act (commonly known as the “Pig Law”), which sentenced anyone who stole property valued at $10 or greater up to five years in prison and quadrupled the prison population, with Black prisoners comprising approximately 85% of inmates. The state most frequently leased convicted persons to individuals, primarily to perform agricultural work on cotton farms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P1'>However, the state also leased incarcerated persons to private companies, such as the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company, and companies subjected convict-laborers to excruciating working conditions with little shelter, sustenance, or medical care. While companies and private individuals leased enslaved workers during the antebellum era, enslavers expected “their human chattel to be returned alive and in good working condition” (Sturkey, <hi rend='italic'>Hattiesburg</hi>). However, this expectation was virtually nonexistent in postwar convict leasing programs. The death toll therefore grew to staggering heights. In response, Mississippi cancelled Gulf &amp; Ship Island’s contract in December 1888 and ceased leasing convicts to private companies in 1890. However, the state and individual counties and towns continued to use convict labor for public works projects and at the state’s penitentiary at Parchman plantation well into the twentieth century (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P.
