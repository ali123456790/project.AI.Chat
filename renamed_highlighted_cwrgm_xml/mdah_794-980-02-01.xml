                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077064P0'>Julius Junkermann was a Republican public figure and private secretary to a governor in Reconstruction Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P1'>Born on November 14, 1841, in Dusseldorf, Germany, Junkermann moved to the United States in 1860, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the Civil War broke out the following year, he was forced into Confederate service. He reportedly deserted the Confederate army at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, and fled to Union lines, where he volunteered for service. He enlisted in the Forty-third Illinois Infantry Regiment and served in the Union army for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P2'>Junkermann resided in Mississippi after the war and was active in Republican Party politics. He married Clara Eggleston, the daughter of Brevet (honorary) Brigadier General Beroth B. Eggleston, a Union officer originally who helped establish the Republican Party in Mississippi during Reconstruction and unsuccessfully ran for governor of the state in the late 1860s. Junkermann and his wife had one daughter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P3'>Junkermann served as Superintendent of Public Education in Washington County, Mississippi, in the early 1870s before becoming Governor Ridgley Powers’s private secretary in 1872. He was commissioned as Quartermaster General, at the rank of brigadier general, in the Mississippi State Militia in January 1872 and served a wide variety of public offices over the next several years, including circuit court clerk in Washington County and U.S. deputy tax collector in Jackson, Mississippi. Junkermann was also nominated for Mississippi state legislature in 1875, but does not appear to have won.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P4'>Junkermann, his wife, and much of his wife’s family, moved to Kansas around 1879, after Reconstruction had ended in the south. He edited a German-language newspaper in Kansas and served as justice of the peace for several years. In the early 1880s, Junkermann experienced unspecified health problems. He traveled to Colorado for treatment in 1883, but his condition worsened and he returned home only a few days later and died on June 1, 1883, in Wichita, Kansas. He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas.

It became part of the newly created Adams County on April 1, 1799. It served as the capital of Mississippi Territory from 1798 until 1802, when it was replaced by Washington. It was reinstated as the capital from 1817 until 1820, when the capital was again replaced by Washington (which was later replaced by the current capital Jackson in 1822). Natchez serves as the county seat. (Wikipedia; Britannica; Mississippi Encyclopedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63188P0'>The Republican Party is a national political party in the United States. It was formed in 1854 in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved previous restrictions to slavery in the western territories of the United States. Anti-slavery members of the Whig and Democratic political parties broke from these groups and joined with members of the singularly focused Free Soil Party to develop a major third party challenger for national politics. The Republican Party strongly opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories but did not advocate for the immediate abolition of slavery in the country. The party was more successful than the preceding Free Soil party because it developed a broader political platform than the territorial issue, adopting Whig-inspired economic principles. The growing success of the Republicans in the late 1850s caused the Whig Party to collapse.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P1'>Republicans ran their first presidential candidate in 1856, John C. Frémont. He lost to Democratic candidate James Buchanan, but came in second in a three-way race, winning 11 northern states. Republicans did win congressional and some state elections, and by the 1860 presidential election had established themselves as the most dominant party within the free states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P2'>The Republican Party nominated Abraham Lincoln for president in 1860. The party’s platform included the declaration that “the normal condition of all the territory of the United States is that of freedom,” and included several other criticisms of slavery. Lincoln and the Republican Party clarified that the federal government could not interfere with slavery in the southern states, but their overt anti-slavery position alarmed southerners who saw the Republicans as a fundamental threat to southern way of life. Southern politicians warned of disunion should Lincoln win, and the 1860 election turned into a contest among four candidates. The Democratic Party split along north-south sectional lines, and Lincoln did not appear on presidential ballots in most slaveholding states. Still, Lincoln and the Republicans won the 1860 presidential election with only northern (free state) votes. The election victory sparked a secessionist movement in the south, even before Lincoln took office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P3'>Lincoln and the Republican Party led the federal government against secession and through the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865. The party fractured some during the war over differences of abolition and punishment of the south. Party members who harbored greater interests in abolition, African American rights, and punishing Confederates became known as the Radical Republicans. Lincoln remained more moderate. He advocated more leniency to former Confederates, and was slower to adopt policies that forced social change within the country.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P4'>When Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, Radical Republicans sought to punish the south and enforce their more extreme policies. Andrew Johnson, the vice president who entered the presidency upon Lincoln’s death, opposed the Radicals. However, his policies frustrated many moderate Republicans, and the party took a more forceful role in southern civil and political affairs when former Confederates tried to limit the rights of African Americans during Reconstruction. The Republican Party had a presence within the south during Reconstruction, but mostly among African Americans and northerners who traveled south for political or economic reasons. The party was still seen by most white southerners as a northern party oppressing the south.

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P5'>By 1868 most of the Republican Party had turned on Johnson, even impeaching him. War hero Ulysses S. Grant was then elected as the Republican Party candidate in 1868 with support from the radicals. His administration faced accusations of corruption, especially in the south and the west. By the 1876 election, national support for Reconstruction was low, and initial voter counts appeared to show the Democratic candidate the winner. Republicans in Congress complained of voter intimidation in the south and after tense political negotiations with Democrats managed to have the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes declared the winner with the agreement to end Reconstruction in the south.
