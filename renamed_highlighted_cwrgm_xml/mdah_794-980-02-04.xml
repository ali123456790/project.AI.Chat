                    <p xml:id='OTPS101965P0'>William Feimster Tucker was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P1'>Born on May 9, 1827, in Iredell County, North Carolina, Tucker graduated from Emory and Henry College in Virginia in 1848. He moved to Houston, Mississippi, and studied law, soon securing a seat as probate judge in Chickasaw County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P2'>Tucker volunteered for Confederate military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He was commissioned as a captain in the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment and saw action at the First Battle of Bull Run. Tucker was later transferred to the western theater, and placed in command of the Forty-first Mississippi Infantry Regiment, where he participated in several battles in Kentucky and Tennessee in 1862 and 1863. In March 1864, he was promoted to brigadier general and commanded Confederate troops against Union forces under William Tecumseh Sherman during the Atlanta Campaign. Tucker was severely wounded at the Battle of Resaca in May 1864 and was forced to retire from field duty. He recovered enough to hold take command of the District of Southern Mississippi and East Louisiana during the final weeks of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P3'>After the Civil War, Tucker returned to Mississippi to practice law. He ran for state political office at the end of Reconstruction, winning two terms in the state’s House of Representatives in the late 1870s. He was murdered on September 14, 1881, in Okolona, Mississippi, when an unknown assailant fired a gun through Tucker’s bedroom window, killing him instantly. The death was suspected to be an assassination, possibly stemming from one of Tucker’s legal cases. Several people were questioned, and two men arrested, but no one was convicted of the murder.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P4'>Tucker was married to Martha Josephine Chackelford. The couple had at least six children that lived to adulthood. Tucker is buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Okolona, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077064P0'>Julius Junkermann was a Republican public figure and private secretary to a governor in Reconstruction Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P1'>Born on November 14, 1841, in Dusseldorf, Germany, Junkermann moved to the United States in 1860, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the Civil War broke out the following year, he was forced into Confederate service. He reportedly deserted the Confederate army at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, and fled to Union lines, where he volunteered for service. He enlisted in the Forty-third Illinois Infantry Regiment and served in the Union army for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P2'>Junkermann resided in Mississippi after the war and was active in Republican Party politics. He married Clara Eggleston, the daughter of Brevet (honorary) Brigadier General Beroth B. Eggleston, a Union officer originally who helped establish the Republican Party in Mississippi during Reconstruction and unsuccessfully ran for governor of the state in the late 1860s. Junkermann and his wife had one daughter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P3'>Junkermann served as Superintendent of Public Education in Washington County, Mississippi, in the early 1870s before becoming Governor Ridgley Powers’s private secretary in 1872. He was commissioned as Quartermaster General, at the rank of brigadier general, in the Mississippi State Militia in January 1872 and served a wide variety of public offices over the next several years, including circuit court clerk in Washington County and U.S. deputy tax collector in Jackson, Mississippi. Junkermann was also nominated for Mississippi state legislature in 1875, but does not appear to have won.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P4'>Junkermann, his wife, and much of his wife’s family, moved to Kansas around 1879, after Reconstruction had ended in the south. He edited a German-language newspaper in Kansas and served as justice of the peace for several years. In the early 1880s, Junkermann experienced unspecified health problems. He traveled to Colorado for treatment in 1883, but his condition worsened and he returned home only a few days later and died on June 1, 1883, in Wichita, Kansas. He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32086877P0'>Organized in the early 1870s, the Vicksburg and Nashville Railroad Company began constructing a railway line between the two cities with financial support from the state of Mississippi and various townships. By 1872, the company reportedly had four hundred laborers and promises to complete the first twenty-five miles of track (the agreed upon length to secure the state’s subsidies of $4,000 per mile). In 1873, the Mississippi legislature passed legislation increasing the state’s subsidies to $8,000 per mile. By 1876, however, construction on the Vicksburg and Nashville Railroad had fallen behind and the company was becoming delinquent on payments. In response, the legislature passed a law requiring the company to deposit bonds to the state treasurer as an effort to better secure the state's investment in the project. Financial problems continued, and reports circulated that the railroad was sold in 1877 and then again in 1882, the latter by a decree of a chancery court. By 1890, all work on the Vicksburg and Nashville Railroad had ceased. To salvage something from the failed railroad effort, especially given the tax dollars put into its construction, the Mississippi legislature passed an act transferring the Vicksburg and Nashville Railroad property and assets to the newly incorporated Nashville and Mississippi Delta Railroad Company in order to construct a north-south rail line in western Mississippi.
