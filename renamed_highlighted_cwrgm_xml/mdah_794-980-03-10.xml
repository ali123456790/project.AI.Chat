                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077652P0'>John Calvin Brown was a Confederate general and later governor of Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077652P1'>Born on January 6, 1827, in Giles County, Tennessee, Brown graduated from Jackson College in Columbia, Tennessee, in 1846 and became a practicing attorney in 1848. He became active in politics in the 1850s as a member of the Whig Party. During the 1860 presidential election, Brown supported the Constitutional Union Party, which was a compromise political group primarily made of southerners that wished to avoid secession. However, after the Civil War broke out in 1861, and his home state of Tennessee declared its separation from the Union, Brown offered his services to the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077652P2'>Brown enlisted as a private in the Confederate army, but was soon elected colonel of the Third Tennessee Infantry Regiment. By early 1862, he was in command of a brigade. He was captured by Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army at Fort Donelson in 1862 and spent several months as a prisoner of war. He was released during a prisoner exchange and returned to field service. Brown was promoted to brigadier general and led Confederate soldiers in Kentucky and Tennessee. He was wounded at Perryville and Chickamauga, but returned to duty each time. In August 1864, he was promoted to major general and commanded a division during the final months of 1864. Brown was badly wounded at the Battle of Franklin and did not return to service until the final days of the war, and surrendered to Union forces in North Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077652P3'>After the Civil War, Brown returned to Tennessee. He returned to practicing law, but soon afterwards entered politics. In 1869 he was elected to the Tennessee legislature and in 1870 was a delegate to the state’s constitutional convention. As a member of the Democratic Party, he won the Tennessee gubernatorial election of 1870. He served as governor until 1875, spending much of his time trying to reduce the state’s debt and to boost public education. After leaving the governor’s office, Brown became an executive in railroad and coal companies. He died on August 17, 1889. He was married twice, first to Anne Pointer, who passed away in 1858. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Childress, in 1864. He had four children. Brown is buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Pulaski, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077064P0'>Julius Junkermann was a Republican public figure and private secretary to a governor in Reconstruction Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P1'>Born on November 14, 1841, in Dusseldorf, Germany, Junkermann moved to the United States in 1860, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the Civil War broke out the following year, he was forced into Confederate service. He reportedly deserted the Confederate army at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, and fled to Union lines, where he volunteered for service. He enlisted in the Forty-third Illinois Infantry Regiment and served in the Union army for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P2'>Junkermann resided in Mississippi after the war and was active in Republican Party politics. He married Clara Eggleston, the daughter of Brevet (honorary) Brigadier General Beroth B. Eggleston, a Union officer originally who helped establish the Republican Party in Mississippi during Reconstruction and unsuccessfully ran for governor of the state in the late 1860s. Junkermann and his wife had one daughter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P3'>Junkermann served as Superintendent of Public Education in Washington County, Mississippi, in the early 1870s before becoming Governor Ridgley Powers’s private secretary in 1872. He was commissioned as Quartermaster General, at the rank of brigadier general, in the Mississippi State Militia in January 1872 and served a wide variety of public offices over the next several years, including circuit court clerk in Washington County and U.S. deputy tax collector in Jackson, Mississippi. Junkermann was also nominated for Mississippi state legislature in 1875, but does not appear to have won.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P4'>Junkermann, his wife, and much of his wife’s family, moved to Kansas around 1879, after Reconstruction had ended in the south. He edited a German-language newspaper in Kansas and served as justice of the peace for several years. In the early 1880s, Junkermann experienced unspecified health problems. He traveled to Colorado for treatment in 1883, but his condition worsened and he returned home only a few days later and died on June 1, 1883, in Wichita, Kansas. He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas.

It was incorporated and became the county seat in 1806, and in 1843, Nashville became the state capital of Tennessee. (Wikipedia; Tennessee Encyclopedia; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

U.S. Congress divides legislators into separate committees who write federal or national legislation, and a vast industry of lobbyists also help members write legislation on behalf of corporate and labor interests. Once written, the proposed legislation is introduced to both houses, and if the bill passes both chambers by a majority vote, it is sent to the U.S. President for passage, veto, or pocket-veto, and Congress can overcome the President's veto with a two-thirds majority vote.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P0'>The United States <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 as the foundational code of laws for the United States of America. It was crafted in 1787 by a convention in Philadelphia originally tasked only with amending the existing <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi>, which had loosely combined the states under a weak central government. Delegates chose to set aside the articles entirely and create a stronger federal government made of three branches: the legislative (comprising two separate parts, the House of Representatives and the Senate), the judicial (led by the Supreme Court), and the executive (headed by the President of the United States). The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> sought to carefully balance competing interests regarding state and national authority, as well as large and small state representation. It also created a more direct relationship between Americans and the national government.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32056792P1'>The convention’s departure from its original mandate to amend the <hi rend='italic'>Articles of Confederation</hi> generated controversy, particularly among Americans who opposed placing a distant central authority of the states. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters advocated the need for a stronger national government and explained that the federal system preserved state authority for most local matters. To guarantee enough support for ratification, the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution’s</hi> supporters agreed to add an addendum to more directly protect individuals' specific rights and freedoms. The <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi> was ratified in 1788 and the new United States government began in early 1789. Shortly afterwards, the new Congress adopted several amendments to the <hi rend='italic'>Constitution</hi>, ten of which were ratified by three-fourths of the states and became known as the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments guaranteed certain rights for American citizens. Since then, seventeen additional amendments have been ratified to the United States Constitution. Three of them—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments—were adopted between 1865 and 1870, during the Reconstruction Era. The Thirteenth Amendment formally abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment provides equal protection for all laws and the Fifteenth Amendment protects voting rights for American citizens regardless of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” both specifically to combat racial discrimination against African Americans following the end of slavery.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.
