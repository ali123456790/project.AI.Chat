                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS57106P0'>Horace Greeley was a newspaper editor and politician from New York during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57106P1'>Born on February 3, 1811, in Amherst, New Hampshire, Greeley became a printer’s apprentice as a teenager and moved to New York City in 1831 to pursue a career in newspaper publishing. In 1834, he started <hi rend='italic'>The New Yorker</hi>, which was successful at first, but ended during a financial downturn in the United States in 1837. Soon afterwards, Greeley became an editor for the <hi rend='italic'>Albany Evening Journal</hi> and involved in promoting Whig Party policies and candidates. He started the successful pro-Whig publication <hi rend='italic'>Log Cabin</hi> in 1840 to support William Henry Harrison’s president campaign, and used success from that publication to start the daily <hi rend='italic'>New-York Tribune</hi>, one of the most influential newspapers in the United States during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57106P2'>Greeley’s support for Whig candidates led to the party’s support for his own political success. He won election to fill a vacant seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from New York in 1848. He served only three months, but managed to draw significant attention through his efforts to ban slavery in Washington, D.C., to increase tariffs, and to change the name of the United States to “Columbia.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57106P3'>Returning to the <hi rend='italic'>New-York Tribune</hi>, Greeley promoted several radical ideas for the nineteenth century era, including vegetarianism and feminism. He also strongly promoted westward expansion, and encouraged young, unemployed, and propertyless men to migrate and develop the western territories. He popularized the saying “Go West, young man.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57106P4'>During the early 1850s, Greeley began to separate from the Whig Party, in large part due to division within the party over the matter of slavery. He helped establish the Republican Party, which was defiantly anti-slavery, and he strongly opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, which opened all western territories to the possibility of slavery through the concept of “popular sovereignty.” Greeley denounced pro-slavery efforts to make Kansas a slave state, and he participated in efforts to send weapons to anti-slavery settlers there when the dispute over Kansas’s future became violent.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57106P5'>Greeley supported Abraham Lincoln’s candidacy for president during the 1860 election, and denounced secession. He was among the northern voices arguing for action against slavery during the Civil War, criticizing Lincoln for his hesitancy to act against the institution during the first two years of the war. By 1864, Greeley had turned against Lincoln, and opposed his reelection. Although largely considered a Radical Republican during the war, Greeley was more reconciliatory to the south and former Confederates during the Reconstruction era. He supported the release of Confederate president Jefferson Davis from prison and criticized Ulysses S. Grant’s administration due to charges of corruption and extended federal intervention in the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57106P6'>In 1872, Republican critics of Grant formed the Liberal Republican Party and nominated Greeley to challenge him in the presidential election. He went on a campaign speaking tour, which was controversial and considered bad taste for that time period, as political candidates typically did not advertise their desire for public office. He argued for the end of Reconstruction and the removal of Grant’s problematic administration. While Greeley’s campaign initially drew great support, his critics published a series of highly effective negative cartoons and stories. They portrayed Greeley as a sympathizer with the Ku Klux Klan and soft on treason.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS57106P7'>In October 1872, shortly before the election, Greeley’s wife of 36 years, Mary Cheney, died of an illness. The loss, as well as the negative press, put him into a depression. He lost the election to Grant and, after learning that executives at his own newspaper were working to remove him from the company, he suffered his own health crisis. Greeley died just a few weeks after the election, on November 29, 1872. He is buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P0'>This subject tag includes references to various and unidentified state and local elections held within Mississippi. During the Civil War, most Mississippians supported secession and the Confederacy and therefore voted in favor of policies and for candidates dedicated to those causes. After the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, President Andrew Johnson instituted a lenient Reconstruction policy that offered amnesty to individuals who took an oath of loyalty to the United States (with exceptions for certain upper-class southerners). This policy allowed many former Confederates to run for office shortly after the end of the war and pass legislation designed to limit the rights of freed African Americans, known as the Black Codes. Restrictions against black political rights led Republicans in the U.S. Congress to take a firmer hand in Mississippi’s Reconstruction and protect Black rights. Between 1867 and 1876, Republicans backed by federal soldiers struggled to ensure Black Mississippians had equal voting rights and could run for office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P1'>Many white southern conservatives, however, used threats and violence to prevent Black Mississippians and white Republicans from voting, or influence the results of elections. These efforts reached a peak in 1874 under the “Mississippi Plan,” which began with a systematic effort to disenfranchise Black voters in Mississippi and evict African American and Republican office holders. As many as three hundred Black people were killed in Vicksburg in the racial violence. President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to Vicksburg to enforce the law, but soldiers were unable to change the political climate within the state. White Democrats organized under the Mississippi Plan suppressed Black and Republican voters enough to dominate state elections in 1875 by 30,000 votes. Reconstruction ended in 1877 with white conservatives still in command of Mississippi’s state and local politics. (Wikipedia; Jason Phillips, "Reconstruction in Mississippi: 1865–1876," Mississippi History Now)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
