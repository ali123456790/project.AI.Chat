                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077064P0'>Julius Junkermann was a Republican public figure and private secretary to a governor in Reconstruction Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P1'>Born on November 14, 1841, in Dusseldorf, Germany, Junkermann moved to the United States in 1860, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the Civil War broke out the following year, he was forced into Confederate service. He reportedly deserted the Confederate army at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, and fled to Union lines, where he volunteered for service. He enlisted in the Forty-third Illinois Infantry Regiment and served in the Union army for the rest of the war.

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P2'>Junkermann resided in Mississippi after the war and was active in Republican Party politics. He married Clara Eggleston, the daughter of Brevet (honorary) Brigadier General Beroth B. Eggleston, a Union officer originally who helped establish the Republican Party in Mississippi during Reconstruction and unsuccessfully ran for governor of the state in the late 1860s. Junkermann and his wife had one daughter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P3'>Junkermann served as Superintendent of Public Education in Washington County, Mississippi, in the early 1870s before becoming Governor Ridgley Powers’s private secretary in 1872. He was commissioned as Quartermaster General, at the rank of brigadier general, in the Mississippi State Militia in January 1872 and served a wide variety of public offices over the next several years, including circuit court clerk in Washington County and U.S. deputy tax collector in Jackson, Mississippi. Junkermann was also nominated for Mississippi state legislature in 1875, but does not appear to have won.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P4'>Junkermann, his wife, and much of his wife’s family, moved to Kansas around 1879, after Reconstruction had ended in the south. He edited a German-language newspaper in Kansas and served as justice of the peace for several years. In the early 1880s, Junkermann experienced unspecified health problems. He traveled to Colorado for treatment in 1883, but his condition worsened and he returned home only a few days later and died on June 1, 1883, in Wichita, Kansas. He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P0'>An immigrant is "a person who has come to a different country in order to live there permanently" (Cambridge Dictionary). Immigrants from other nations have always comprised a significant portion of the U.S. population, yet the number was relatively small until the middle decades of the nineteenth century, when political and economic turmoil in Europe forced many people to flee. Immigrants came from all over the world, though the vast majority (90.4 percent by one estimation) came from Europe (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 54). In the West, and particularly in California, the United States also saw a large increase in Chinese and Japanese-born immigrants.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P1'>Immigrants came to the United States for varied reasons. Many Eastern and Western Europeans immigrated to flee religious or political persecution, while immigrants from around the world sought to improve their economic circumstances in the U. S. Immigrants to the U. S. settled overwhelmingly in urban centers, though some few also settled in rural areas of the South and Midwest.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P2'>Immigration often led to racial, ethnic, and class conflicts. Many native-born, white, Protestant Americans feared the ethnic and religious differences of immigrants as well as the potential economic competition they represented. This led to the rise of nativism, or discrimination and often violence against those born outside of the U. S., and the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know-Nothing Party in the 1840s and 1850s. Free African Americans and white European immigrants who both often faced discrimination and poverty also perceived each other as economic competition. This tension occasionally produced outbreaks of violence like the New York City Draft Riots of 1863 in which predominantly Catholic Irish and German immigrants, having been drafted into the U. S. Army but refusing to fight for Black freedom, rioted in response to the Emancipation Proclamation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025732P3'>Ultimately, the American Civil War placed native-born and foreign-born soldiers alongside each other in battle, cooling the nativist sentiments of the decades prior; however, non-European immigrants, especially Chinese-born, continued to face discrimination based on their immigrant status. (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 53-100; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32131533P0'>The term Swiss means a person or object from Switzerland, or the Swiss Confederation, a country in central Europe. Located in the Alps, the country is made up of traditionally German, Italian, French, and Romansh cultural regions. The Swiss people developed a national identity despite these differences over several hundred years of cooperative efforts and resistance to outside invasion. Origins of the Swiss Confederation can be tied to the Federal Charter of 1291, which established an alliance among several communities within the Alps. The small confederation developed a reputation across Europe for its superb military capabilities, and Swiss mercenaries were among the most highly sought fighting force during the fifteenth and sixteenth century. The Swiss Confederation separated from the Holy Roman Empire in 1658 and established itself as a neutral country. However, French forces invaded the old Swiss Confederation in 1798 and enacted a new constitution that strengthened the national government of Switzerland. Because of the French involvement in Swiss affairs, Austrian and Russian forces invaded Switzerland during the Napoleonic Wars, prompting the Swiss to once again declare their neutrality in European affairs and gain greater independence from France in 1803. The country formally reestablished its neutrality, recognized by European powers, in 1815. The country underwent a brief civil war in the late 1840s which resulted in a stronger unification of Swiss people and a new constitution that established a government similar to the United States. The Swiss continue to maintain their neutrality in most world affairs and take pride in their country being one of the most developed and wealthiest countries in the world. (Wikipedia)
