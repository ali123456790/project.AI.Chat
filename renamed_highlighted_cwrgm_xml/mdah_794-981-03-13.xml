                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077064P0'>Julius Junkermann was a Republican public figure and private secretary to a governor in Reconstruction Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P1'>Born on November 14, 1841, in Dusseldorf, Germany, Junkermann moved to the United States in 1860, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the Civil War broke out the following year, he was forced into Confederate service. He reportedly deserted the Confederate army at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, and fled to Union lines, where he volunteered for service. He enlisted in the Forty-third Illinois Infantry Regiment and served in the Union army for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P2'>Junkermann resided in Mississippi after the war and was active in Republican Party politics. He married Clara Eggleston, the daughter of Brevet (honorary) Brigadier General Beroth B. Eggleston, a Union officer originally who helped establish the Republican Party in Mississippi during Reconstruction and unsuccessfully ran for governor of the state in the late 1860s. Junkermann and his wife had one daughter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P3'>Junkermann served as Superintendent of Public Education in Washington County, Mississippi, in the early 1870s before becoming Governor Ridgley Powers’s private secretary in 1872. He was commissioned as Quartermaster General, at the rank of brigadier general, in the Mississippi State Militia in January 1872 and served a wide variety of public offices over the next several years, including circuit court clerk in Washington County and U.S. deputy tax collector in Jackson, Mississippi. Junkermann was also nominated for Mississippi state legislature in 1875, but does not appear to have won.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P4'>Junkermann, his wife, and much of his wife’s family, moved to Kansas around 1879, after Reconstruction had ended in the south. He edited a German-language newspaper in Kansas and served as justice of the peace for several years. In the early 1880s, Junkermann experienced unspecified health problems. He traveled to Colorado for treatment in 1883, but his condition worsened and he returned home only a few days later and died on June 1, 1883, in Wichita, Kansas. He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32103629P0'>William Wallace "Judge" Chisolm was a Sheriff, Republican Judge, and outspoken opponent to the Ku Klux Klan in Kemper County, Mississippi during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32103629P1'>Born on December 6, 1830 in Morgan County, Georgia, Chisolm moved to Kemper County, Mississippi with his family in 1846. In 1858, he was elected as a justice of the peace, followed by probate judge in 1860. Chisolm is also listed as a merchant and farmer on the 1860 Census Record for Kemper County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32103629P2'>His actions during the Civil War are unclear. One newspaper article reports that he voted for secession and served in the Confederate militia. Another claims that he was a Unionist, but he does not appear to have enlisted in the Confederate Army itself.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32103629P3'>Chisolm's actions after the Civil War, however, are much clearer. He became active in Republican politics and was a supporter of Reconstruction, actively opposing the Ku Klux Klan in Kemper County. This included testifying against the Klan's activities to the Congressional committee. From 1869 to 1875, Chisolm served as the county Sheriff, and he received death threats throughout this period. Then in 1875, he was accused of the attempted murder of Judge A. W. Dillard. After his acquittal, Chisolm became increasingly active in mobilizing the Republican Party in Kemper County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32103629P4'>This came to a head on April 26, 1877 when Sheriff John William Gully, a Democrat, was shot and killed near Chisolm's home. Chisolm was later acquitted with the confession of a Black man named Walter Riley, but at the time, Chisolm and two other Republicans (Hoppen and J. P. Gilmer) were arrested and taken to the county jail. Chisolm's family, including his wife and children, and his friend Angus McLellan accompanied him. After reaching the jail, McLellan was shot in the back and a mob of around 300 men surrounded the jail. The ensuing violence ended with the deaths of McLellan, Judge Chisolm, Chisolm's thirteen-year old son John Mann Chisolm, and Chisolm's eighteen-year old daughter Cornelia Josephine Chisolm. Gully's murder marked one step towards the end of Reconstruction in Mississippi, and no charges were filed for Chisolm's murder.

Judge Chisolm died on May 13, 1877 in De Kalb, Kemper County, Mississippi. He was buried in the Riverview Cemetery in Huntingdon, Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69344P0'>Stemming from the first century CE, Christianity is the world's largest religion with over two billion adherents. Its largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. A large influence on American identity and thought since the nation's founding, Christianity (particularly protestant evangelicalism) spread rapidly in the first three decades of the nineteenth century in the United States due to a series of religious revivals known as the Second Great Awakening. Many Americans injected Christian beliefs and practices into many of the major social, political, and legal debates in the country, including debates over slavery (both pro and antislavery stances), education, and social reform. Christianity also became a prominent religion among the enslaved in the United States, who employed Christian rhetoric and belief in much of their social, religious, and cultural activities, and critical to enslaved people's agency and resistance.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69344P1'>American Christianity in the nineteenth century primarily emphasized both one's individual responsibility to God as well as collective responsibility for one's neighbors. Also deeply important to American Christians in the nineteenth century was millennialism, or the belief that Jesus Christ would establish a 1,000 year reign of peace on earth. These combined elements produced efforts at reform with the intent to perfect society in order to invoke that reign. Many of the enslaved, however, applied millennialism to the hope of slavery's abolition. Numerous politicians also incorporated Christian imagery and language to justify "Manifest Destiny," or the idea that the God of Christianity ordained that the United States' borders would extend from the eastern to western coasts of North America, while both the Confederate and United States governments applied Christian rhetoric to support their causes. Christianity existed and still exists in many different and often competing forms, yet the development of those forms came to define much of American culture in the nineteenth century and beyond (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 285-327; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 8; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69341P0'>Baptists are members "of a Christian group that believes that baptism should not happen until a person is old enough to ask for it and to understand its meaning" (Cambridge Dictionary). Itself divided into numerous different denominations, the Baptist denomination of Christianity is united in rejecting the infant baptism by sprinkling of water common in many other Christian churches, instead opting for the full immersion of adults into water. This denomination grew widely as a part of the Second Great Awakening in the first few decades of the nineteenth century, appealing to many by its recruitment of church leadership from laypeople, emotional preaching style, and its inclusion of African Americans and women (Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 180).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)
