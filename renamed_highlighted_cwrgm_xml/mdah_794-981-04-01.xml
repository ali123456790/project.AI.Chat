                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077064P0'>Julius Junkermann was a Republican public figure and private secretary to a governor in Reconstruction Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P1'>Born on November 14, 1841, in Dusseldorf, Germany, Junkermann moved to the United States in 1860, settling in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the Civil War broke out the following year, he was forced into Confederate service. He reportedly deserted the Confederate army at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, and fled to Union lines, where he volunteered for service. He enlisted in the Forty-third Illinois Infantry Regiment and served in the Union army for the rest of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P2'>Junkermann resided in Mississippi after the war and was active in Republican Party politics. He married Clara Eggleston, the daughter of Brevet (honorary) Brigadier General Beroth B. Eggleston, a Union officer originally who helped establish the Republican Party in Mississippi during Reconstruction and unsuccessfully ran for governor of the state in the late 1860s. Junkermann and his wife had one daughter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P3'>Junkermann served as Superintendent of Public Education in Washington County, Mississippi, in the early 1870s before becoming Governor Ridgley Powers’s private secretary in 1872. He was commissioned as Quartermaster General, at the rank of brigadier general, in the Mississippi State Militia in January 1872 and served a wide variety of public offices over the next several years, including circuit court clerk in Washington County and U.S. deputy tax collector in Jackson, Mississippi. Junkermann was also nominated for Mississippi state legislature in 1875, but does not appear to have won.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077064P4'>Junkermann, his wife, and much of his wife’s family, moved to Kansas around 1879, after Reconstruction had ended in the south. He edited a German-language newspaper in Kansas and served as justice of the peace for several years. In the early 1880s, Junkermann experienced unspecified health problems. He traveled to Colorado for treatment in 1883, but his condition worsened and he returned home only a few days later and died on June 1, 1883, in Wichita, Kansas. He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077632P0'>David Peter Lewis was an attorney and politician who served as governor of Alabama during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077632P1'>Born on May 18, 1820, in Charlotte County, Virginia, Lewis moved to Alabama as a child with his family. He studied law in Alabama and Virginia before becoming a practicing attorney in Alabama in 1843. His legal work proved profitable, allowing him to purchase land and more than thirty enslaved people by 1860. Lewis became active in politics on the eve of the Civil War. He attended Alabama’s secession convention in 1861 and voted against the state separating from the Union, but signed the secession ordinance after a majority of delegates voted for it. Lewis was elected to the Provisional Confederate Congress in early 1861, but resigned almost immediately to join a militia company. The unit dissolved before being accepted into Confederate service. He then turned down an offer for a commission in a different unit.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077632P2'>In 1862, Lewis became involved in pro-Union, or anti-war, activities in Alabama. The following year, he received an appointment as a circuit court judge and served until January 1864. When Confederate officials tried to draft him into military service a few months later, Lewis fled northward to Tennessee and crossed into Union lines. He remained outside of Alabama until after the Civil War ended.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077632P3'>Lewis returned to Alabama in the summer of 1865 and practiced law. He briefly returned to politics, serving as a delegate to the National Democratic Convention in 1868. However, in 1869, he switched parties and became a Republican. In 1872, he was nominated for governor by Alabama Republicans, largely due to the fact that he was a native white Unionist, rather than a northern-born candidate who moved to the state after the war. He easily won the election, but soon found fierce disagreement over the Alabama legislature. Democrats and Republicans each declared electoral victory and created two separate legislatures. Following guidance from the U.S. Attorney General, Lewis merged both legislatures, which created a political stalemate as Republicans controlled the Alabama House of Representatives and Democrats controlled the Alabama Senate.  Additionally, Lewis found himself in a difficult position over civil rights for Black southerners, as many white Alabamians supported the maintenance of white supremacy, while his African American voters urged greater protections. Overall, Lewis’s term as governor was filled with political fighting that hurt his reputation. He lost his reelection bid in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077632P4'>Lewis returned to practicing law after he left the governor’s office. Conservative white Democrats began to dominate Alabama politics, and Lewis found it difficult to get any state position. He quietly abandoned his Republican identity and merged back into the Democratic Party by late 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077632P5'>Lewis died on July 3, 1884. He was never married. He is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).
