                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32067513P0'>Albert Talmon Morgan was a Union soldier during the Civil War and a Republican politician in Mississippi during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P1'>Born on June 9, 1842, in Theresa, New York, Morgan moved as a child with his family to Wisconsin. He began attending Oberlin College in Ohio, but left school to volunteer for Union military service at the start of the Civil War. He enlisted in the Second Wisconsin Infantry Regiment, which became part of the famed “Iron Brigade”—a brigade of four midwestern Union regiments known for their broad black hats and bravery in battle. Morgan was wounded and captured at Brawner’s Farm during the opening shots of the Battle of Second Manassas in August 1862, but was exchanged and returned to his unit in time to be wounded again at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. He was repeatedly promoted during the war, eventually reaching the rank of captain in late 1864. When the Second Wisconsin Infantry was so badly depleted due to casualties, Morgan and the remaining members of the regiment were formed into an independent battalion that was eventually placed into the Sixth Wisconsin Infantry Regiment. Morgan was wounded a third time, during fighting near Petersburg, Virginia, but again returned to service to muster out with his unit.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P2'>In November 1865, after separating from the Union army, Morgan moved to Mississippi with his brother Charles. He started a pro-Republican newspaper in Yazoo City and served as a delegate to Mississippi’s constitutional convention in 1868 and 1869. He then won election to the Mississippi Senate in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P3'>In 1870, Morgan married Carolyn Victoria Highgate, a teacher from Ithaca, New York, who was part African American. Morgan successfully labored within the Mississippi Senate to overturn the state’s laws against interracial marriage in order to legally marry Carolyn. The couple had six children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P4'>While serving as state senator in the early 1870s, Morgan also took the office of chancery clerk in Yazoo County. In 1873, he was ejected from the Senate for holding both positions at the same time. Shortly after losing his Senate seat, Morgan ran for sheriff of Yazoo County. Although he won the election, the incumbent sheriff, Francis P. Hilliard, refused to vacate the office. The dispute led to a deadly confrontation in January 1874, as both men led groups of supporters to take control of the courthouse. During the altercation, Hilliard was shot in the head and killed. Morgan was arrested for the killing and spent several months in jail, but a grand jury decided not to indict him, at least in part because officials believed the fatal shot may have come from a different direction than Morgan. Released from jail and cleared of all charges, Morgan took his place as sheriff.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P5'>Political violence increased in Mississippi in 1874 and 1875, as white conservatives began attacking Black residents and Republicans. Morgan’s efforts to quell the violence failed, and he was chased out of the county after a group of armed men broke apart a Republican meeting in Yazoo County in September 1875. He departed Mississippi in 1876 and testified in U.S. Congressional hearings in Washington, D.C., about the racial violence in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P6'>After leaving Mississippi, Morgan and his family lived in Kansas and then in Colorado. He died on April 15, 1922, in Denver. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Now I strongly suspect that the truth has not been told to you, but base and false fabrications have, hence I wrote to you—and challenge any man to contro-vert the truth of what I say. <rs ref='#S63934'>Judge</rs> <rs ref='#S101971'>Robert Bowman</rs> &amp; Co<add place='above'>l</add>. <rs ref='#S32078957'>Luse</rs> of this County and Hon <rs ref='#S32077646'>J.

Morgan, I agreed, now for then—that a bill of Exceptions might be made, and signed—A bill of Exceptions was made out by Co<add place='above'><hi rend='underline'>l</hi></add> Morgan's Counsel—I could not agree to its facts as stated and because the evidence of several witnesses was wholly left out. In this state of the case Gen<add place='above'>l</add> Miles was at my urgent request invited to come here and confer with me upon a proper bill as we understood it, He did come in a reasonable time, and joined me in the courtesy that a bill might be taken now for then, although no subh bill had ever been asked for until long after the trial—In the meantime Judge <rs ref='#S32076508'>Drennans</rs> head (officially) had been chop<add place='above'>d</add> off by you, and hence he could do no official act in the premises.

Morgan every legal facility in my power—It has not been my purpose to persecute him nor have I done so, but to prosecute within the law—the case confided to me, By the rules of law he is entitled to no bill of Exceptions, because neither him or his counsel asked for or took any on the trial &amp; judgement nor was there any request or agreement that one might or should be made out or taken after-wards—My conduct has been generous and beyond the usual scope, Miles, has been equally so, and under such conduct I naturally feel that we should be free from any as-persion—and I am provoked, when blame is laid at our door, to denounce the affair as base and false.
