                    <p xml:id='OTPS32078490P0'>William Pitt Kellogg was governor of Louisiana and a U.S. Senator during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P1'>Born on December 8, 1830, in Orwell, Vermont, Kellogg moved to Illinois as a young man and taught school. In the 1850s he moved to Illinois and became an attorney, meeting fellow lawyer Abraham Lincoln. When Lincoln entered the U.S. presidency in 1861, Kellogg received an appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Nebraska Territory. He only briefly held that position before volunteering for military service and served as an officer in the Seventh Illinois Cavalry Regiment. By 1862, he had received a promotion to colonel, but resigned that summer due to health problems and returned to Nebraska to resume his duties in the territorial Supreme Court.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P2'>In 1865, Kellogg received an appointment as the federal customs collector in New Orleans, Louisiana. He held that position until 1868, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate for Louisiana, upon that state’s readmission to the Union. In 1872, Kellogg ran for governor of Louisiana as a Republican. Upon winning a disputed election, he resigned his Senate seat. Democrats, and even some Republicans, challenged Kellogg’s legitimacy in office, however he remained governor largely through the support of President Ulysses S. Grant. The Louisiana legislature impeached Kellogg in 1876, but the state Senate did not convict him.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P3'>In 1876, Kellogg again ran for the U.S. Senate. He won, despite severe opposition by conservative white Democrats. He served until 1883, but did not run for reelection due to the collapse of the Republican Party in Louisiana and the resurgence of Democratic control. However, Kellogg managed to secure enough support to win a U.S. House of Representatives seat during the 1882 election and served in that role from 1883 to 1885.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P4'>After his Congressional career, Kellogg retired in Washington, D.C. He died on August 10, 1918. He was married to Mary Ellen Wills. Kellogg is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32057087P0'>Ridgley C. Powers served as governor of Mississippi from 1871 to 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P1'>Born in Mecca, Ohio, on December 24, 1836, Powers was raised and educated in the north. In 1862, after receiving a degree from the University of Michigan, and conducting graduate work at Union College in New York, Powers enlisted in the Union Army for service during the Civil War. He was promoted to second lieutenant and then captain in the 125th Ohio Infantry Regiment and saw action in Tennessee and Georgia. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Powers had achieved the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P2'>Upon separating from the military, Powers settled in Mississippi. He purchased land and began a cotton plantation. He soon became a public figure, serving as sheriff in Noxubee County. By 1868, Powers had gained status in Mississippi’s Republican Party, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1869. Although he was a “carpet bagger” (northerner who settled in the south during Reconstruction), Powers was generally respected by white Mississippians. This was in contrast to Governor James Alcorn, a northern by birth, but who was considered a “scalawag” since he had lived in Mississippi since the 1840s and had served in the Confederacy before joining the Republican Party. When Alcorn resigned the governor’s office in 1871 to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, Powers assumed the state’s executive office. He became active in promoting Mississippi’s economic development and independence, advocating crop variety and lesser dependence upon imported goods. Despite his efforts to maintain a stable political and economic environment in Mississippi, a rift grew among Republicans that led to competing party nominations for governor in 1873. Alcorn was nominated by the more conservative wing of Republicans against Adelbert Ames, former Union general and military governor, who was backed by the radicals. Ames won the election and took the governor’s seat in 1874.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32057087P3'>In 1875, shortly after leaving office, Powers married Louisa Born. The couple had one child who died in infancy. They moved to Arizona, but Louisa suffered from a mysterious medical condition and began traveling across the United States and Europe for treatment. She passed away in New York in 1882 after undergoing surgery. Powers later remarried (to Mary Wilson) and moved to California. He spent the rest of his life as a rancher and businessman at Los Angeles. He died on November 11, 1912, and is buried in Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077652P0'>John Calvin Brown was a Confederate general and later governor of Tennessee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077652P1'>Born on January 6, 1827, in Giles County, Tennessee, Brown graduated from Jackson College in Columbia, Tennessee, in 1846 and became a practicing attorney in 1848. He became active in politics in the 1850s as a member of the Whig Party. During the 1860 presidential election, Brown supported the Constitutional Union Party, which was a compromise political group primarily made of southerners that wished to avoid secession. However, after the Civil War broke out in 1861, and his home state of Tennessee declared its separation from the Union, Brown offered his services to the Confederacy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077652P2'>Brown enlisted as a private in the Confederate army, but was soon elected colonel of the Third Tennessee Infantry Regiment. By early 1862, he was in command of a brigade. He was captured by Ulysses S. Grant’s Union army at Fort Donelson in 1862 and spent several months as a prisoner of war. He was released during a prisoner exchange and returned to field service. Brown was promoted to brigadier general and led Confederate soldiers in Kentucky and Tennessee. He was wounded at Perryville and Chickamauga, but returned to duty each time. In August 1864, he was promoted to major general and commanded a division during the final months of 1864. Brown was badly wounded at the Battle of Franklin and did not return to service until the final days of the war, and surrendered to Union forces in North Carolina.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32077652P3'>After the Civil War, Brown returned to Tennessee. He returned to practicing law, but soon afterwards entered politics. In 1869 he was elected to the Tennessee legislature and in 1870 was a delegate to the state’s constitutional convention. As a member of the Democratic Party, he won the Tennessee gubernatorial election of 1870. He served as governor until 1875, spending much of his time trying to reduce the state’s debt and to boost public education. After leaving the governor’s office, Brown became an executive in railroad and coal companies. He died on August 17, 1889. He was married twice, first to Anne Pointer, who passed away in 1858. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Childress, in 1864. He had four children. Brown is buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Pulaski, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32056697P0'>James Hill served in various Mississippi state offices after the Civil War, most notably as secretary of state from 1874 to 1878. He was the last African American to hold a state level office in Mississippi until the twentieth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P1'>Born on the plantation of James Hill in Marshall County, Mississippi, in 1837 or 1838, Hill was referred to as a mulatto in nineteenth century terminology, indicating he was likely biracial. Rumored to be the biological son of the plantation owner (whose name he shared), Hill was legally a slave under policies that established a child inherited the labor status of the mother. As he grew, Hill reportedly was taught how to read by the slave owner’s two white daughters, and he subsequently acquired machining skills at railroad shops in Holly Springs. He earned a reputation as a first-class mechanic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P2'>Upon gaining his freedom after the Civil War, Hill’s previous education and technical skills made him a strong candidate for new opportunities for African Americans in Republican Reconstruction. He received an appointment as land registrar of Mississippi in 1867 and a year later was elected to the Mississippi state legislature. During his term as a legislator, he helped elect Hiram Revels to the U.S. Senate—the first African American to serve in that position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P3'>In 1873, African American voters in Mississippi helped elect a series of candidates dedicated to racial equality, including northern-born Republican Adelbert Ames as Mississippi governor and Black attorney Alexander K. Davis as lieutenant governor. Hill was elected Mississippi’s secretary of state. Democrats in Mississippi almost immediately conducted a campaign of violence and intimidation against Republican and Black voters, sweeping several subsequent elections and stacking the Mississippi legislature with white supremacist representatives by 1875. The conservative Democrats in office tried clear state Republicans from top state positions, holding impeachment proceedings against Ames and Davis. Both men were removed from office in early 1876, but Hill retained his seat as secretary of state, and completed his term in 1878.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P4'>He remained in public service, serving as district internal revenue collector and then postmaster in Vicksburg, appointments given by the president. Following these assignments, Hill served as president of the Mississippi Cotton Manufacturing Company in Jackson. He received one more appointment, in the United States General Land Office in Jackson in 1900. Three years later, in February 1903, he started the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi State Register</hi>, a weekly newspaper that advocated racial harmony. Unfortunately, he died of heart failure less than six months later. Hill never married or had children. He is buried in Mount Olive Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.
