                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32056697P0'>James Hill served in various Mississippi state offices after the Civil War, most notably as secretary of state from 1874 to 1878. He was the last African American to hold a state level office in Mississippi until the twentieth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P1'>Born on the plantation of James Hill in Marshall County, Mississippi, in 1837 or 1838, Hill was referred to as a mulatto in nineteenth century terminology, indicating he was likely biracial. Rumored to be the biological son of the plantation owner (whose name he shared), Hill was legally a slave under policies that established a child inherited the labor status of the mother. As he grew, Hill reportedly was taught how to read by the slave owner’s two white daughters, and he subsequently acquired machining skills at railroad shops in Holly Springs. He earned a reputation as a first-class mechanic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P2'>Upon gaining his freedom after the Civil War, Hill’s previous education and technical skills made him a strong candidate for new opportunities for African Americans in Republican Reconstruction. He received an appointment as land registrar of Mississippi in 1867 and a year later was elected to the Mississippi state legislature. During his term as a legislator, he helped elect Hiram Revels to the U.S. Senate—the first African American to serve in that position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P3'>In 1873, African American voters in Mississippi helped elect a series of candidates dedicated to racial equality, including northern-born Republican Adelbert Ames as Mississippi governor and Black attorney Alexander K. Davis as lieutenant governor. Hill was elected Mississippi’s secretary of state. Democrats in Mississippi almost immediately conducted a campaign of violence and intimidation against Republican and Black voters, sweeping several subsequent elections and stacking the Mississippi legislature with white supremacist representatives by 1875. The conservative Democrats in office tried clear state Republicans from top state positions, holding impeachment proceedings against Ames and Davis. Both men were removed from office in early 1876, but Hill retained his seat as secretary of state, and completed his term in 1878.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P4'>He remained in public service, serving as district internal revenue collector and then postmaster in Vicksburg, appointments given by the president. Following these assignments, Hill served as president of the Mississippi Cotton Manufacturing Company in Jackson. He received one more appointment, in the United States General Land Office in Jackson in 1900. Three years later, in February 1903, he started the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi State Register</hi>, a weekly newspaper that advocated racial harmony. Unfortunately, he died of heart failure less than six months later. Hill never married or had children. He is buried in Mount Olive Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).
