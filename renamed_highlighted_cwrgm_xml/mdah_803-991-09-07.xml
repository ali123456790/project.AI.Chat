                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32028070P0'>Charles Albert Brougher served as Mississippi’s secretary of state in the 1860s. Born on June 19, 1824, in Morgan County, Alabama, Brougher moved to Mississippi at a young age, as his father entered politics there, serving in the Mississippi Senate in the early 1840s. Brougher graduated from Pennsylvania College (modern-day Gettysburg College) in 1846 and initially went into teaching. He then took up the study of law, and became a practicing attorney in Ripley, Mississippi in 1852.

<p xml:id='OTPS32028070P1'>In 1858, Brougher was elected Clerk of Mississippi’s House of Representatives. In 1860, he was appointed Mississippi’s secretary of state, to fill the vacancy created when B. R. Webb died in that office only six days into his first term. Brougher remained in that position through the secession crisis and first two years of the Civil War. He won reelection in 1863, and only left the secretary of state’s office when Union authorities took civil control of Mississippi in June 1865. Brougher was elected to the seat again in October 1865 and served until 1869. Brougher died on November 25, 1891. He was married to Marie Louise Earle and had seven children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32078672P0'>Obadiah Crew French was a politician and public figure in Mississippi during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078672P1'>Born in Ohio in 1836, French worked as a farmer until the Civil War. He joined the 104th Ohio Infantry Regiment in 1862 and served with that unit for slightly over a year, at which point he transferred to the First Battalion, Tennessee Light Artillery, a Union organization. While with the Tennessee unit, French became the private secretary to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of the state, who later became Abraham Lincoln’s vice president and assumed the presidency upon Lincoln’s assassination in 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078672P2'>After the war, French moved to Mississippi as a federal official, and then found financial success in contracting and doing business with the Mississippi Central Railroad. He became active in Republican politics in Mississippi, serving in the state legislature for much of the early 1870s. In 1872 and 1876, French was part of the National Republican Executive Committee, and served as a delegate to the 1872 Republican National Convention. In 1879, shortly after Reconstruction ended in Mississippi, French moved to Colorado and became a farmer and rancher. He again sought public office, and accepted an appointment as chief enrolling clerk of the Colorado Senate.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078672P3'>In 1900, French moved to Oklahoma and took a position as U.S. Court Commissioner. Afterwards he served secretary of the Oklahoma Live Stock Commission. He ran for election to the Oklahoma Senate in 1902 but lost.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078672P4'>French died on May 25, 1910. He was married to Mary Carey Fowler and had at least three children that survived to adulthood. He is buried at Temple Masonic Cemetery in Temple, Oklahoma.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32079669P0'>Peter Crosby was an African American sheriff in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32079669P1'>Born a slave in Clarke County, Mississippi, in 1844, Crosby was liberated during the Civil War and joined the Fifth U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery in Vicksburg in 1864. Following the Civil War, he became active in local political matters, participating in Republican Party meetings, and seeking election for public office, serving as constable of Yazoo City in the late 1860s and then treasurer of Warren County in 1873. In November 1873, Crosby won election for sheriff of Warren County. However, conservative white Democrats contested his electoral victory and on December 2, 1874, a large group of armed men forced him to resign. A few days later, on December 7, 1874, several Black protesters held a gathering in front of the Warren County Courthouse in support of Crosby’s reinstatement as sheriff. They were confronted by several white conservatives, and gunfire soon erupted. The fight was heavily one-sided, with one white man and twenty-five Black men killed in the affair. The incident was referred to by some as the Vicksburg riots, but has largely been recognized as the Vicksburg Massacre.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32079669P2'>The incident drew attention of federal authorities, and President Ulysses S. Grant sent soldiers to Vicksburg to reinstate order. Federal troops under General Philip Sheridan returned Crosby to the office of sheriff, but not before additional attacks by conservative whites took the lives of as many as three hundred Black Mississippians in January 1875. Once again serving as sheriff, Crosby appointed J. P. Gilmer as a deputy. On June 7, 1875, Gilmer shot Crosby in the head in an apparent assassination attempt. While Crosby survived, he never fully recovered from the wound and was unable to continue his role as sheriff. Gilmer was arrested for the assault, but was never tried or convicted. Crosby died on March 15, 1884.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32072881P0'>William Hemsley Emory was an engineer and U.S. Army officer during the Civil War and Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32072881P1'>Born on September 7, 1811, in Queen Anne’s County, Maryland, Emory graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1831. He initially served as an artillery officer, but resigned his commission in 1836 to study civil engineering. He returned to the U.S. Army in 1838 to serve in the Corps of Topographical Engineers and became one of the U.S. government’s top surveyors during the mid-nineteenth century. He studied rivers and harbors, and mapped areas of the Texas Republic in the early 1840s. When the Mexican-American War broke out in 1846, Emory served on the staff of General Stephen Kearny. The maps he made between 1846 and 1848 of the American southwest became the standard by which most military and political officials used for the region for the next several years. When the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, Emory surveyed the new border between the United States and Mexico.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32072881P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Emory was stationed in Indian Territory. He successfully worked with friendly Native American allies to withdraw his outnumbered Union force from pro-Confederate Indians. Emory received a promotion to brigadier general and commanded Union troops in various campaigns, including at Port Hudson in the west and in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. He ended the war as a brevet (honorary) major general of volunteers.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32072881P3'>After the Civil War, Emory remained in the U.S. Army. He commanded the Department of the Gulf, which oversaw federal Reconstruction in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. He continued to support federal policies in the south until he retired in 1876. He died on December 1, 1887. Emory was married to Matilda Bache and had ten children. He is buried in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS104376P1'>Born around 1824 in Alabama, Barton moved to Mississippi in the 1840s and married Mary E. Coopwood.  He studied law and became a practicing attorney. During the Reconstruction era, Barton became active in Republican politics and was nominated by Governor Adelbert Ames to be chancellor of Mississippi’s Eighth District in 1874. However, Barton’s critics objected based upon the fact that he had been charged with forgery for altering a deed during his legal practice. A grand jury had reportedly concluded he was likely guilty, but Barton avoided conviction based upon a statute of limitation. Democrats in Mississippi used the appointment in their impeachment proceedings against Ames, accusing him of knowingly nominating a criminal to state office. Barton disappeared from the public eye after the Reconstruction era.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32076240P0'>Alexander K. Davis was a representative in the Mississippi legislature and served as the state’s lieutenant governor from 1874 to 1876, during Reconstruction. He was the first African American lieutenant governor of Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32076240P1'>Little was recorded of Davis’ past. His date and place of birth are not known. During testimony before Congress in 1871 he explained that he moved to Noxubee County, Mississippi, from Tennessee in 1869, and said he had been admitted to the bar (a reference that he had been accepted as a practicing attorney in a city or county), but did not specify in which state. He won a seat in Mississippi’s House of Representatives shortly after coming to Mississippi and became a leading figure in the state’s Republican Party circles. In 1873, Radical Republicans backed by a majority of African American voters in Mississippi, won a series of state elections. Davis was one of three African Americans elected to statewide office that year, winning the lieutenant governor seat. (The other Black figures to win statewide election were James Hill as secretary of state and T. W. Cardozo as state superintendent of education.) The following year, white conservatives carried out a campaign of intimidation and violence to suppress Republican and African American voting and put Democrats into political power. The effort worked and by 1875, Democrats held a majority of state legislative seats. Emboldened by their political power, Democrats tried to rid Republicans from many state positions. They specifically targeted Davis and northern-born and Radical Republican Governor Adelbert Ames, accusing both men of improprieties in office. Davis was charged with illegal granting of pardons. Despite his effort to fight the trumped-up charges, Mississippi Democrats impeached Davis in March 1876. Knowing that the conviction would result in him being removed from office, Davis resigned. Governor Ames, also facing politically-driven impeachment proceedings that would require extensive time and financial resources to fight, resigned as well. Following his resignation, Davis abandoned politics. He moved to Canton, Mississippi and worked as a pastor. He died on November 21, 1884.

<p xml:id='OTPS32084831P1'>Born in 1853 in Jennings County, Indiana, Jobes moved to Kosciusko, Mississippi in 1871. He worked as a civil engineer in the railroad and levee construction industries. By 1874, he was engaged in the convict leasing business with Ridgley Ceylon Powers, and in 1875, Mississippi Governor Adelbert Ames granted Jobes and Obadiah Crew French a license to organize a firm for leasing convicts from the state penitentiary. As general brokers, they leased all of the state's convicts and subleased them to others at increased rates. They were in operation through 1876.

<p xml:id='OTPS32084831P2'>By 1880, Jobes was working as a banker, and in 1886, he moved to Harper County, Kansas, continuing to work as a banker until 1897. From 1897 to 1901, he was a National Bank Examiner stationed out of Wichita, Kansas. He was responsible for over two hundred fifty National Banks. After 1901, he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he became the president of the American National Bank. He was also the vice president of the Pioneer Trust Company and president of the Security National Bank.

<p xml:id='OTPS32084831P3'>Jobes was married to Alma G. (Taylor) Jobes. The pair had four children, including two sons and one daughter who lived to adulthood. Charles S. Jobes died on September 27, 1929 in Kansas City, Missouri. He is buried in the Forest Hill Cemetery in Kansas City.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD99399P0'>Plantations are farms that typically grow cash crops, and often specialize in a single product, such as cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane. Plantation farming continues in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century, especially for crops like coffee beans, rubber trees, and cocoa. In American history the term plantation is most often associated with estates in the American south. Historical descriptions of plantations generate images of large farming operations. However, even moderately-sized southern farms that planted cash crops were sometimes referred to as plantations.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P1'>Southern plantations before the Civil War were strongly tied to the institution of slavery. As profit-driven agricultural operations, plantations required large numbers of laborers. This fed the demand for African slave importation to the British colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and bolstered the defense of slavery among southern planters in the nineteenth century. Plantation crops varied by region within the south, with rice being popular in Georgia and South Carolina along the Atlantic coast, tobacco being an early cash crop in Virginia, and then—after the invention of the cotton gin at the end of the eighteenth century which quickly separated seeds from the cotton fibers—the boom in cotton growing across the Deep South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P2'>By 1860, there were approximately 46,200 plantations across the south. More than 20,000 had twenty to thirty slaves. Only about 2,300, or five percent, had one hundred or more slaves. The enslaved African Americans carried out most of the farming, construction, and domestic work. The plantations were their home. The same was not always true for the plantation owners. The very large operations frequently had wealthy absentee owners, who resided in cities or other states, leaving plantation supervision responsibilities to hired white overseers. Smaller plantation owners usually lived on their property, but almost always in separate buildings from the enslaved laborers. Slave cabins, or slave quarters, were a ubiquitous part of a plantation. They represented the heart of the laborers’ community on the property, but were usually of basic construction and few amenities.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD99399P3'>Following the abolition of slavery after the Civil War, many freed people continued to live on plantations. Sharecropping became a popular arrangement between the landowners and the laborers. The property was often divided into plots with tenants assigned to certain sections. The system involved a contract or arrangement which allowed the laborer, or tenant, to keep a portion of the crop they raised. The system was abused, and developed a negative reputation for the level of poverty many sharecroppers (mostly Black, but some white) experienced on plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Representatives of the Freedmen’s Bureau sought to protect Black sharecroppers by regulating contracts during Reconstruction, but the withdrawal of federal officials after 1876 left many African American tenants more subject to unfair sharecropping contracts on the old plantations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32086877P0'>Organized in the early 1870s, the Vicksburg and Nashville Railroad Company began constructing a railway line between the two cities with financial support from the state of Mississippi and various townships. By 1872, the company reportedly had four hundred laborers and promises to complete the first twenty-five miles of track (the agreed upon length to secure the state’s subsidies of $4,000 per mile). In 1873, the Mississippi legislature passed legislation increasing the state’s subsidies to $8,000 per mile. By 1876, however, construction on the Vicksburg and Nashville Railroad had fallen behind and the company was becoming delinquent on payments. In response, the legislature passed a law requiring the company to deposit bonds to the state treasurer as an effort to better secure the state's investment in the project. Financial problems continued, and reports circulated that the railroad was sold in 1877 and then again in 1882, the latter by a decree of a chancery court. By 1890, all work on the Vicksburg and Nashville Railroad had ceased. To salvage something from the failed railroad effort, especially given the tax dollars put into its construction, the Mississippi legislature passed an act transferring the Vicksburg and Nashville Railroad property and assets to the newly incorporated Nashville and Mississippi Delta Railroad Company in order to construct a north-south rail line in western Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P0'>When the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, it failed to abolish involuntary servitude. The amendment included a loophole banning involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted" (Library of Congress). White southerners in the post-emancipation South, concerned about both the availability of labor and the freedom of African Americans, manipulated this clause and turned to convict leasing to entrench long standing racial hierarchies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P1'>Immediately after the war, many states passed "Black Codes" or laws severely limiting African Americans' rights. Under these codes and other similar laws passed in the decades following the Civil War, African Americans could be arrested for any number of petty crimes, including vagrancy (functionally construed to mean any act of social mobility not approved by a white person) or theft (in Mississippi a felony if exceeding $10 worth of goods). Widespread racism and stereotypes about Black criminality led to a dramatic expansion in the population of imprisoned individuals and an overwhelming number of African Americans within that population. Many states leased those convicted persons to private companies or individuals for their labor, and in certain cases lessees had been the pre-emancipation enslaver of the leased.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P2'>Laborers worked in a variety of settings including shipbuilding and timber cutting, yet the most prominent form in states like Mississippi remained large-scale agricultural work. The convict lease system was incredibly dangerous and difficult for those who lived through it, as leased persons faced unsafe working conditions, inadequate living conditions, abuse from lessees, and grueling work schedules. Given these circumstances, the ready availability of imprisoned laborers, and the callousness of lessees and state officials, the mortality rate among convict laborers was incredibly high.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P3'>Certain states ceased leasing imprisoned persons to individuals or private companies in the late nineteenth century, only to continue using that labor on state-funded infrastructure projects like road or highway construction until, in some cases, World War II. Southern individuals and states thereby continued to increase their wealth through the coerced labor of African Americans while perpetuating anti-Black racism and laying the foundations of the modern prison-industrial complex (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P0'>In the wake of the Civil War, many states turned to convict leasing to bolster infrastructural repair and to maintain long standing racial hierarchies. Like many other southern states, Mississippi instituted a convict leasing program, and in 1876 the state passed the Leasing Act (commonly known as the “Pig Law”), which sentenced anyone who stole property valued at $10 or greater up to five years in prison and quadrupled the prison population, with Black prisoners comprising approximately 85% of inmates. The state most frequently leased convicted persons to individuals, primarily to perform agricultural work on cotton farms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P1'>However, the state also leased incarcerated persons to private companies, such as the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company, and companies subjected convict-laborers to excruciating working conditions with little shelter, sustenance, or medical care. While companies and private individuals leased enslaved workers during the antebellum era, enslavers expected “their human chattel to be returned alive and in good working condition” (Sturkey, <hi rend='italic'>Hattiesburg</hi>). However, this expectation was virtually nonexistent in postwar convict leasing programs. The death toll therefore grew to staggering heights. In response, Mississippi cancelled Gulf &amp; Ship Island’s contract in December 1888 and ceased leasing convicts to private companies in 1890. However, the state and individual counties and towns continued to use convict labor for public works projects and at the state’s penitentiary at Parchman plantation well into the twentieth century (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32031023P0'>Like many slaveholding states of the former Confederacy, Mississippi operated a convict leasing system between the 1860s–1900s. Under convict leasing systems, states leased imprisoned people to perform unfree labor for companies and individuals in exchange for a fee. State and county laws (such as "Pig Laws" and vagrancy laws) and racially selective prosecutions funneled large, overrepresented populations of African Americans into their prison institutions. Therefore, Mississippi's convict leasing system replaced the state's former system of race-based chattel slavery and laborers encountered harsh conditions, violent punishments, and high death tolls. Public outcry over these conditions, especially following the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company's convict leasing practices, forced Mississippi to abolish its convict leasing program in 1890, becoming the first state to do so. County governments, however, continued to operate convict leasing arrangements using chain gangs until the 1900s. In 1904 Mississippi opened Parchman Prison on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta and consolidated much of its convict labor there. (Mississippi Encyclopedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P0'>This subject tag includes references to various and unidentified state and local elections held within Mississippi. During the Civil War, most Mississippians supported secession and the Confederacy and therefore voted in favor of policies and for candidates dedicated to those causes. After the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, President Andrew Johnson instituted a lenient Reconstruction policy that offered amnesty to individuals who took an oath of loyalty to the United States (with exceptions for certain upper-class southerners). This policy allowed many former Confederates to run for office shortly after the end of the war and pass legislation designed to limit the rights of freed African Americans, known as the Black Codes. Restrictions against black political rights led Republicans in the U.S. Congress to take a firmer hand in Mississippi’s Reconstruction and protect Black rights. Between 1867 and 1876, Republicans backed by federal soldiers struggled to ensure Black Mississippians had equal voting rights and could run for office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P1'>Many white southern conservatives, however, used threats and violence to prevent Black Mississippians and white Republicans from voting, or influence the results of elections. These efforts reached a peak in 1874 under the “Mississippi Plan,” which began with a systematic effort to disenfranchise Black voters in Mississippi and evict African American and Republican office holders. As many as three hundred Black people were killed in Vicksburg in the racial violence. President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to Vicksburg to enforce the law, but soldiers were unable to change the political climate within the state. White Democrats organized under the Mississippi Plan suppressed Black and Republican voters enough to dominate state elections in 1875 by 30,000 votes. Reconstruction ended in 1877 with white conservatives still in command of Mississippi’s state and local politics.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32097921P0'>The election of 1875 was fraught with racial violence. The Democratic Party, which was overwhelmingly comprised of white Mississippians, carried out what was called the "white line" campaign, in which white Mississippians inflicted violence against Black Americans who attempted to exercise their right to vote. White mob violence largely prevented Black Americans and other Republicans from participating in the election of 1875, which allowed for a widespread victory for Democrats in Mississippi that year.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32122316P0'>Adelbert Ames, a famed Union general and recipient of the Medal of Honor, was appointed provisional governor of Mississippi by President Andrew Johnson in 1868. As a strong supporter of African American rights, Ames gained wide support among Mississippi’s Black population, and became associated with the more radical elements of the Republican Party, in contrast to the moderate Republicans who mostly supported former Confederate general James Alcorn. He served in the U.S. Senate for Mississippi after it was readmitted into the Union in 1870 and in 1873 he defeated Alcorn in the state's gubernatorial election.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32122316P1'>Following a strong Republican showing in the 1874 election, conservative white Mississippians carried out the “Mississippi Plan” to regain Democratic control of Mississippi’s government. Widespread voter intimidation and violence, especially toward the state’s Black voters, led to a sweeping Democratic victory in 1875. Upon convening in 1876, the new Democratic majority in Mississippi’s legislature wrote up articles of impeachment against Governor Ames and other Republican officials, including the state’s first African American lieutenant governor Alexander K. Davis. Although critics found no evidence of corruption against Ames, political opposition within the legislature ousted Davis and virtually ensured Ames’ impeachment and removal from office. To avoid a high profile and costly impeachment trial, Ames’ lawyers brokered a deal for the legislature to drop the charges if he resigned from office. On March 29, 1876, Ames stepped down as governor. (Wikipedia; Mississippi History Now; Mississippi Encyclopedia)<lb/>

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63200P0'>A militia is a military unit made up of civilians within a community who could be called up by local (often state) officials to serve temporary military purposes. Militias were separate from regular, or permanent, armies. Because they conducted training only periodically, and provided active military service for short periods of time, militias cost less than regular armies; and because they were manned by local residents, militias were frequently seen as less threatening to early American communities than national military units comprised of strange men born in other counties or states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P1'>When Mississippi seceded in 1861, enthusiasm for military service swept across the state. Volunteers filled the ranks of old militia units or created new companies within their communities, eager to repulse any federal attempt to coerce secessionists back into the Union. They also took proactive efforts, securing key positions along the Gulf Coast, including reinforcing other Southern soldiers at Pensacola and Fort Pickens in Florida. Over the next few months, as the Confederate government requested more volunteers, thousands of Mississippians and entire volunteer companies from the state transferred to Confederate service and were sent north, out of state. The units that remained within Mississippi for state defense were left in a convoluted military structure, some considered state reserves (a more formal military force for state defense) and some considered state militia (the more traditional units of citizen-soldiers called up for local, emergency use). The distinctions were not well established, and during the war Mississippians describing state units not within the Confederate army used a variety of terms—such as militia, home guard, state troops—almost interchangeably. However, under this subject tag at CWRGM you will find references to the militia and state troops; references that specifically referred to the home guard can be found separately under the Mississippi Home Guard subject tag.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P2'>While militia and state defense units technically fell under the governor’s authority, the state government struggled to manage, or even track, these organizations. Some, like the Third Battalion Mississippi Minute Men, were well organized, fell under direct state control, and took part in larger military operations, such as the defense of Vicksburg; others saw no combat, rarely gathered for drill, and were entirely overseen by county or local community officials. Most militia members were older than the average Confederate soldier. They were typically farmers, business owners, or land owners who had families and, in many instances, slaves. Because of these responsibilities at home, militiamen expected their military duties to be periodic, temporary, and only during times of emergency, a reflection of the militia’s original intent. However, state officials occasionally activated militia units for long periods, based upon the military situation. In the summer of 1862, Mississippi’s governor, John J. Pettus, mobilized his state troops, pulling many militia units away from their communities. Held in camp for several weeks, drilling but not seeing combat, many militiamen complained of their treatment and argued that their services were needed more at home, managing farms and their communities. Despite these complaints, the governor mobilized the state troops again in 1864, and again met criticism.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63200P3'>Overall, Mississippi’s militia and state defense system during the Civil War was a complicated tangle of formal and informal military units. Infrequently used for combat assignments, these units nevertheless provided some emergency services for the state government and allowed many Mississippians a way to provide military service to the community while remaining at home to manage personal and local interests.

Ballard, <hi rend='italic'>The Civil War in Mississippi: Major Campaigns and Battles</hi>, 4-8)

CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

Respondent says that on the occasion referred to in said eighteenth article Peter Crosby, Sheriff of Warren County having asked, in the course of the evening, what were his rights and duties in regard to regaining possession of the office from which he had been violently and illegally ejected, the Attorney General of the State, the Honorable G. E Harris, being present, read or caused to be read by some one standing near, from the Code of Mississippi of 1871, a section or part of a section defin-ing the rights and powers of sheriff in this State, as an answer to the question of the said Crosby, and that this respondent did then and there say nothing more to the said Crosby than that he should follow the advice of the Attorney General. And this respondent denies every allega-tion in said eighteenth article tend-ing to charge him with the design to disturb the peace and good or-der of the county of Warren or with any other illegal design or intent.
