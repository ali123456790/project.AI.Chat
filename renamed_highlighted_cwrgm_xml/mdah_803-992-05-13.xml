                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32082663P0'>Richard Coke was an attorney and politician who served as a U.S. Senator and governor of Texas in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32082663P1'>Born on March 18, 1829, in Williamsburg, Virginia, Coke graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1848 and moved to Waco, Texas, in 1850 to practice law. His law firm prospered and Coke purchased land and slaves to expand his wealth and prominence.  By the late 1850s he was active in state government matters, including serving on a Texas commission to oversee the removal the Comanche tribe from portions of Texas in 1859. In 1861, he won election to be a delegate to Texas’s secession convention and voted in favor of the state separating from the Union. After the Civil War broke out, Coke raised a company of volunteers that was integrated into the Fifteenth Texas Infantry Regiment. He served as an officer in the regiment and was wounded in the Battle of Bayou Bourbeau in November 1863.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32082663P2'>Immediately following the Civil War, Coke returned to Texas and received an appointment as a district court judge. Only a year later, in 1866, he was elected to be an associate justice on the Texas Supreme Court. However, federal authorities removed Coke and four other justices due to their opposition to Reconstruction. The removal boosted Coke’s standing among conservative whites in Texas. He successfully ran for governor as a Democrat in December 1873. The Texas Supreme Court ruled the election had violated Texas laws, but Coke’s supporters took over the state capitol and inaugurated him in January 1874. Over the next few years he helped lead a Democratic resurgence in the state that broke down many Reconstruction policies that protected Black civil rights in the 1870s.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32082663P3'>Coke resigned his governor’s seat in 1876 when he won election to the U.S. Senate. He served three consecutive terms, retiring after his third term expired in 1895. He retired in Waco and died on May 14, 1897. He was married Mary Evans Horne and had at least four children. Coke is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Waco, Texas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32026864P0'>Around 90,000 Texans served in the military during the American Civil War. The state fielded 45 cavalry regiments, 23 infantry regiments, 12 cavalry battalions, four infantry battalions, and several artillery units between 1861 and 1865. The far greater number of cavalry units over infantry was unusual during a war in which foot soldiers made up the vast majority of Union and Confederate forces. However, two-thirds of Texas’ soldiers remained in the state or operated in the southwest territories guarding against Union incursions and battling Native Americans. Therefore, most Texans preferred to be mounted to cover these great distances. Beyond the practical interest of travel, though, cavalry was the most popular military branch for Texas volunteers due to the strong cultural importance of horsemanship in the region. For the larger Confederate war effort, Texas’ most famous contribution was an infantry brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia, known as the Texas Brigade. The brigade was also called Hood’s Brigade, after its famed commander John Bell Hood, and saw action in every major battle in the Eastern Theater except First Manassas in 1861 and Chancellorsville in 1863 and earned a reputation for hard fighting.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32026864P1'>Texas fell within the Trans-Mississippi Theater during the Civil War. This theater included areas west of the Mississippi River and saw significantly less attention and support than the Western Theater (generally accepted as including the combat east of the Mississippi River to eastern Tennessee and Georgia) and the Eastern Theater (primarily Virginia and the campaigns into Maryland and Pennsylvania). In January 1862, the Confederate War Department created the Trans-Mississippi District to oversee military activities in the theater. Because of the theater proved too large for a single administrative body, only a few months later Confederate authorities reconfigured the Trans-Mississippi District and divided it into two new districts: the district of Arkansas and the district of Texas. The two districts divided Louisiana, which became a problem as Union forces began capturing locations along the Mississippi River. The Confederate War Department then created a separate district for Louisiana, leaving the Texas district responsible for Confederate operations in its home state as well as the territories of New Mexico and Arizona.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32026864P2'>The Battle of Palmito Ranch occurred in Texas on May 13, 1865, making it the last battle of the American Civil War—more than a month after Robert E. Lee’s surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox. Also in Texas, roughly three weeks later, on June 2, 1865, Confederate commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, General E. Kirby Smith, formally surrendered the last Confederate ground forces. (Texas State Historical Association; Texas Military Forces Museum; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
