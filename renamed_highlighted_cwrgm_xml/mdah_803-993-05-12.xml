                    <p xml:id='OTPS32077302P0'>Dr. Fred Barrett was the private secretary of Mississippi governor Adelbert Ames during Reconstruction and a newspaper editor. Born on November 5, 1843, in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, Barrett graduated with a medical degree from Jefferson College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1866, and practiced medicine in Pennsylvania for two years before moving to Mississippi during the Reconstruction era. He was an active member of the Republican Party and served in the Mississippi legislature for four years, before working as the private secretary of northern-born governor Adelbert Ames. Barrett also became involved in newspaper editing, managing the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Republican</hi> in the 1870s.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32082683P0'>Mass racial violence has persisted throughout the history of the United States and has roots in the country's founding principles of racialized slavery and racial segregation. In essence, mass racial violence is when one group of people stigmatizes another group based on racialized myths and then weaponizes this stigmatization to inflict violence to intimidate and control those groups of people. From the earliest days of European colonization, Indigenous peoples were subjected to violence and displacement, and this pattern of violence continued against African Americans during the period of slavery and into the Jim Crow era, as well as against immigrant populations throughout United States history. Mass racial violence has taken many forms, including lynchings, massacres, riots, and police brutality. Mass racial violence has been perpetrated by both individuals and groups, and it has been motivated by a variety of factors, including racism, economic inequality, and political extremism. Examples of mass racial violence include the Wilmington Race Riot of 1898, the Red Summer of 1919, the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, and the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, though mass racial violence has happened all over the United States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32124248P0'>The “Austin War” (or “Tunica War”) was a tense racial episode in August 1874 in the town of Austin, Tunica County, Mississippi. The event was sparked by an altercation between a white resident, named Dr. Guy R. Smith, and a Black individual named Whittaker in late June 1874. Smith drew a pistol and fired at Whittaker, but struck and killed an innocent African American child nearby. Local authorities arrested Smith and held him in jail for several weeks but then released him on bail. The release of Smith sparked a fierce protest among local Black residents, causing panic among white Mississippians in the area. Soon, newspapers reported stories of an African American riot at Austin. A force of seventy-five armed white men arrived, but then departed after believing themselves to be outnumbered by Black residents gathering for a fight. A group of four hundred armed white men, mostly from Tennessee, then descended upon Austin, expecting to see the village destroyed by the Black mob. The Tennessee group was led by former Confederate Brigadier General James Chalmers, who had commanded Confederate troops at the Battle of Fort Pillow, an event famous for accusations of war crimes against Black Union prisoners. When Chalmers’ vigilante group arrived at Austin, they found the town quiet, with a group of thirty African American men guarding their families and property. Chalmers and his men reportedly detained the Black defenders and claimed a great victory in putting down the riot.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P0'>This subject tag includes references to various and unidentified state and local elections held within Mississippi. During the Civil War, most Mississippians supported secession and the Confederacy and therefore voted in favor of policies and for candidates dedicated to those causes. After the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, President Andrew Johnson instituted a lenient Reconstruction policy that offered amnesty to individuals who took an oath of loyalty to the United States (with exceptions for certain upper-class southerners). This policy allowed many former Confederates to run for office shortly after the end of the war and pass legislation designed to limit the rights of freed African Americans, known as the Black Codes. Restrictions against black political rights led Republicans in the U.S. Congress to take a firmer hand in Mississippi’s Reconstruction and protect Black rights. Between 1867 and 1876, Republicans backed by federal soldiers struggled to ensure Black Mississippians had equal voting rights and could run for office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P1'>Many white southern conservatives, however, used threats and violence to prevent Black Mississippians and white Republicans from voting, or influence the results of elections. These efforts reached a peak in 1874 under the “Mississippi Plan,” which began with a systematic effort to disenfranchise Black voters in Mississippi and evict African American and Republican office holders. As many as three hundred Black people were killed in Vicksburg in the racial violence. President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to Vicksburg to enforce the law, but soldiers were unable to change the political climate within the state. White Democrats organized under the Mississippi Plan suppressed Black and Republican voters enough to dominate state elections in 1875 by 30,000 votes. Reconstruction ended in 1877 with white conservatives still in command of Mississippi’s state and local politics.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P0'>Voting is the activity of choosing someone or something in an election. The United States Constitution left the states with the responsibility of managing elections, leading to a wide variety of voting practices. Initially, the two most common forms of voting in the United States involved voice vote and paper ballots. Most paper ballots during the early nineteenth century through the Civil War involved “party tickets,” which included the names of candidates of only one party. The voter provided the ballot to election officials, meaning voting was a public display of the voter’s selection. This practice made voters more susceptible to public pressure or intimidation during contentious elections or in communities dominated by one political party. During Reconstruction, some communities began using blank ballots, also known as the “Australian ballot,” which provided more secrecy for voters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P1'>During the Civil War, many northern states began changing voting practices to account for the thousands of men in the Union army and away from home. Before the war, only Pennsylvania allowed soldiers to vote by mail-in or absentee ballots. The election of 1864 was the first time since 1812 that a presidential election occurred during a war. With so many residents on the war front, between 1862 and 1864 twenty northern states passed laws to grant their soldiers the right to vote through mail-in ballots. The issue was contentious, in part because many Democrats argued that Republican officials would tamper with the military votes. Democrats were also more aligned with anti-war sentiment and opposition to emancipation of African Americans. Many Democrats feared that frontline soldiers would boost electoral support for the President Abraham Lincoln’s reelection. Indeed, most Union soldiers voted for Lincoln, helping secure his reelection.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P2'>Voting rights changed dramatically in the South after the Civil War. Federal Reconstruction laws prohibited former Confederates from voting until they took a loyalty oath, or, in some cases, appealed to President Andrew Johnson personally. Many ex-Confederates undertook these steps and managed to regain voting rights and run for office shortly after the war. These white officials passed highly discriminatory laws, starting with Mississippi in late 1865, known as the “Black Codes,” which restricted African American rights. Republicans in the U.S. Congress then implemented more oversight in Reconstruction and better protected Black civil rights including the right to vote. This included the passage and ultimate ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited states from denying any person the right to vote based upon race, color, or previous condition of servitude. These protections only covered men, as women were still not allowed to vote in most elections in most states. As a result, African Americans played a large part in southern elections, boosting Republican Party success and leading to African American politicians winning seats in local, state, and national offices. Conservative white voters in the South responded by engaging in voter suppression through violence and intimidation. The “Mississippi Plan” in 1875 was one such effort, which led to a dramatic drop in Republican votes, leading to the Democratic Party takeover of Mississippi’s state legislature.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P3'>The end of Reconstruction in 1877 led to a new wave of restrictions against Black voting in the South. Many southern states began implementing poll taxes, literacy tests, and the “grandfather clause” designed to disenfranchise African American voters. Many southern Blacks could not afford the poll taxes or were not literate enough to pass voter reading requirements. The “grandfather clause” prohibited voting for anyone whose grandfather had not been eligible to vote, a policy aimed directly at the descendants of the formerly enslaved. These laws lasted well into the twentieth century. (Cambridge Dictionary, Smithsonian Institute, National Geographic, Wikipedia, National Archives and Records Administration)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD70882P0'>The Confederate Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Known also as the Confederate States Army or Southern Army, it was established by the Provisional Confederate Congress in February 1861 and fell under the authority of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Modeled after the U.S. Army of the 19th century, the Confederate Army technically fell into two categories: a small regular army of professional officers and soldiers (the Army of the Confederate States of America) and a much larger, temporary force of citizen soldiers intended to exist only for the duration of the war (the Provisional Army of the Confederate States). In reality, the Confederacy’s regular army never fully developed and the overwhelming majority of Confederate soldiers served in the provisional force. The distinction between the two played little role during military operations and all were generally considered to be part of the overall Confederate Army.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P1'>As many as 1,000,000 soldiers served in the Confederate Army between 1861 and 1865, although not all at one time. Most were volunteers, however, the Confederate government instituted a conscription (or draft) in April 1862—the first in U.S. or Confederate history—to increase the size of the Confederacy’s military force and encourage voluntary enlistment. The government passed two more conscription acts over the next two years. More than ten percent of the men who served in Confederate ranks were drafted.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P2'>Over ninety percent of soldiers in the Confederate Army were native-born white men. Nine percent were foreign-born white men. Several Native American units—particularly from the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw tribes—served within the Confederate military, especially in the trans-Mississippi theatre. The Confederate military heavily relied upon the forced labor of enslaved African Americans for building fortifications and carrying out menial tasks, and the Confederate government did not formally allow African Americans (free or slave) to join the army until a last minute desperate measure passed the Confederate Congress in March 1865, only weeks before the end of the war. Only around two hundred enslaved soldiers were organized into service, but they were not sent into combat.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD70882P3'>By the time the last Confederate soldiers surrendered to Union forces in June 1865, nearly 100,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 160,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71916P0'>The United States Army is the military land force of the United States of America. During the American Civil War it was also referred to as the Union Army, Federal Army, or Northern Army. Its primary military objective during the war was the restoration and preservation of the United States through the defeat of secessionist forces. The United States Army traces its roots to the Continental Army, created in 1775 during the American Revolution. Following American independence, the new United States severely reduced the size of the army due to distrust of permanent standing military forces. The small regular army generally handled military operations against Native Americans and for coastal defense. State authorities were expected to support the country’s military needs with their militias, or by raising volunteer units, temporarily activated for federal service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P1'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States regular army consisted of barely more than 16,000 soldiers, scattered across the country (primarily at coastal defenses and forts established in the territories) among ten infantry regiments, four artillery regiments, two cavalry regiments, two dragoon regiments, and one regiment of mounted rifles. Roughly 20% of the army’s officers and enlisted resigned their positions to fight for the Confederacy. After Southern troops attacked and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to expand the army and defeat the Confederates. The government continued to issue subsequent requests for volunteers as the war progressed. As with established practice, the states were to recruit the volunteers and provide them for federal service. Initial enlistments were for 90 days, but eventually enlistment terms were expanded, typically for three years. In total, more than 2,000,000 men served in the United States Army during the course of the Civil War. Of those, only around 60,000 were part of the regular army. The overwhelming majority were in state-based units. Most soldiers were volunteers, however the federal government began drafting men in 1862, as the army’s campaigns continued and volunteer numbers dwindled. In total, around 46,000 Union soldiers (about 5.5%) were draftees.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P2'>Approximately two-thirds of the soldiers in the United States Army during the Civil War were native-born white citizens. Around 100,000 were from states within the Confederacy. Immigrants made up about 25% of Union soldiers, with Germans and Irish immigrants being among the most prominent. The army also included soldiers of different ethnicities, including more than 3,000 Native American soldiers. In 1863, the Union army began formally accepting African American soldiers—in segregated units—and by the end of the war, around than 179,000 had served in the United States Army uniform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71916P3'>When hostilities ended in June 1865, approximately 110,000 had been killed in combat or succumbed to wounds, more than 220,000 had died of disease, and roughly 30,000 had died in prison camps. (Wikipedia; National Park Service)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63188P0'>The Republican Party is a national political party in the United States. It was formed in 1854 in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved previous restrictions to slavery in the western territories of the United States. Anti-slavery members of the Whig and Democratic political parties broke from these groups and joined with members of the singularly focused Free Soil Party to develop a major third party challenger for national politics. The Republican Party strongly opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories but did not advocate for the immediate abolition of slavery in the country. The party was more successful than the preceding Free Soil party because it developed a broader political platform than the territorial issue, adopting Whig-inspired economic principles. The growing success of the Republicans in the late 1850s caused the Whig Party to collapse.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P1'>Republicans ran their first presidential candidate in 1856, John C. Frémont. He lost to Democratic candidate James Buchanan, but came in second in a three-way race, winning 11 northern states. Republicans did win congressional and some state elections, and by the 1860 presidential election had established themselves as the most dominant party within the free states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P2'>The Republican Party nominated Abraham Lincoln for president in 1860. The party’s platform included the declaration that “the normal condition of all the territory of the United States is that of freedom,” and included several other criticisms of slavery. Lincoln and the Republican Party clarified that the federal government could not interfere with slavery in the southern states, but their overt anti-slavery position alarmed southerners who saw the Republicans as a fundamental threat to southern way of life. Southern politicians warned of disunion should Lincoln win, and the 1860 election turned into a contest among four candidates. The Democratic Party split along north-south sectional lines, and Lincoln did not appear on presidential ballots in most slaveholding states. Still, Lincoln and the Republicans won the 1860 presidential election with only northern (free state) votes. The election victory sparked a secessionist movement in the south, even before Lincoln took office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P3'>Lincoln and the Republican Party led the federal government against secession and through the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865. The party fractured some during the war over differences of abolition and punishment of the south. Party members who harbored greater interests in abolition, African American rights, and punishing Confederates became known as the Radical Republicans. Lincoln remained more moderate. He advocated more leniency to former Confederates, and was slower to adopt policies that forced social change within the country.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P4'>When Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, Radical Republicans sought to punish the south and enforce their more extreme policies. Andrew Johnson, the vice president who entered the presidency upon Lincoln’s death, opposed the Radicals. However, his policies frustrated many moderate Republicans, and the party took a more forceful role in southern civil and political affairs when former Confederates tried to limit the rights of African Americans during Reconstruction. The Republican Party had a presence within the south during Reconstruction, but mostly among African Americans and northerners who traveled south for political or economic reasons. The party was still seen by most white southerners as a northern party oppressing the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P5'>By 1868 most of the Republican Party had turned on Johnson, even impeaching him. War hero Ulysses S. Grant was then elected as the Republican Party candidate in 1868 with support from the radicals. His administration faced accusations of corruption, especially in the south and the west. By the 1876 election, national support for Reconstruction was low, and initial voter counts appeared to show the Democratic candidate the winner. Republicans in Congress complained of voter intimidation in the south and after tense political negotiations with Democrats managed to have the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes declared the winner with the agreement to end Reconstruction in the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P6'>The Republican Party continues to be one of the top two political parties in the United States. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57050P0'>The prisoner of war experience varied across time and geography during the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate governments, expecting a short war, did not possess the capabilities of maintaining large prisoner of war populations. Early in the war, prisoners were often exchanged on a one-to-one basis through a parole process and returned to their respective armies. However, the Union Army's enlistment of Black troops in 1862 soured the exchange process and led to the creation of large prison camps in both the North and South.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P1'>As the war continued, and battles grew larger and more frequent, the number of prisoners held in these camps quickly exceeded their capacities, leading to overcrowding by 1863. Civil War prison camps, particularly the Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, presented some of the most appalling living conditions of the war, which only deteriorated over time. Prisoners of war during the American Civil War faced inadequate food, water, and shelter while living in cramped and deeply unsanitary conditions. Prisoners of war therefore made up a significant portion of deaths during the war, often dying from starvation or sickness. The experiences of prisoners of war differed depending on which camp they were confined to and depending on their race or ethnicity, particularly as the Confederacy in 1863 adopted a policy of executing Black soldiers who surrendered rather than imprisoning them. Even among whites, hostilities over the experiences of battle also led to abuse and violence within the camps, as prisoners sought revenge on vulnerable prisoners.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57050P2'>Ultimately, the prisoner of war experience for those who survived was universally traumatizing and produced one of the most contentious points both during the Civil War and in its commemoration and reconciliation afterword, as the treatment of prisoners of war became a rallying cry for pointing out the cruelties of the enemy for both North and South (National Battlefield Trust; National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
