                    <p xml:id='OTPS63540P0'>James Duncan Stewart was an attorney and a Confederate officer from Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63540P1'>Born around 1824 in Mississippi, Stewart graduated from the University of Virginia in 1844. He studied law at Cambridge University and returned to Mississippi to practice law. Stewart reportedly served in the First Mississippi Regiment, under future Confederate president Jefferson Davis, during the Mexican-American War, from 1846 to 1848. After that war, he resumed his legal practice in Mississippi and owned a plantation. His legal practice and military experience boosted his popularity in the community, and he served a term in the Mississippi legislature in the late 1840s. By the late 1850s, he also served as president of the board of directors of the Mississippi State Hospital.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63540P2'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stewart volunteered for Confederate service. He was appointed chief of ordnance for Mississippi, tasked with acquiring and issuing weapons and ammunition to Mississippi troop, and served in that capacity from 1863 to 1865. After the war, Stewart was briefly considered a candidate for governor of Mississippi, but he largely stayed out of politics during the Reconstruction era and ran a successful law firm with Thomas T. Swann in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1879, he was elected to the Mississippi Senate, and served a single term. In the 1880s, Stewart was appointed registrar of the U.S. land office in Jackson.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS63540P3'>Stewart died on June 27, 1905. He was married to Amanda Yerger, who passed away in 1873. He had nine children. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74237P0'>Ethelbert Barksdale served in the Confederate States Congress from Mississippi during the Civil War and later represented Mississippi in the U.S. Congress after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P1'>Born on January 4, 1824, in Smyrna, Tennessee, Barksdale moved to Mississippi as a young man and began work as a journalist. He served as editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Yazoo City Democrat</hi> in the 1840s and in 1850 moved to Jackson to run the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippian</hi>, a Democratic Party newspaper. In 1860, he was selected to be a delegate to the Democratic Party’s national convention in Charleston, South Carolina. He proved to be a dominant voice for southern slaveholding interests at the convention, and when the Democratic Party leaders ultimately sided with northern Democrat Senator Stephen A. Douglas’ principle of popular sovereignty (the people of the territories could choose the fate of slavery), Barksdale walked out of the convention in protest with delegates from seven southern states. The Charleston convention nominated Douglas as the party’s national candidate for the 1860 presidential election, while the southern Democrats who split from the convention held their own meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, and nominated John C. Breckenridge to more strongly defend southern interests in slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P2'>Barksdale returned to Mississippi to rally support for Breckenridge, and he advocated secession as a response to northern anti-slavery actions. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president, Barksdale was among those calling for Mississippi to separate from the Union. He served as one of Mississippi’s representatives in the Confederate Congress during the entire Civil War. One of his final policy efforts was a last-ditch effort to allow African Americans serve as soldiers in the Confederate army. The matter was initially supported by a small number of military and political figures, desperate to raise troops to combat the Union’s manpower superiority. It saw heavy resistance, but finally passed in the final weeks of the war, though it was never implemented.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P3'>After the Civil War, Barksdale remained active in Democratic politics, serving as a delegate to party conventions in 1868, 1872, and 1880. From 1877 to 1879, he was chairman of the Democratic state executive committee. Then, in 1882, after Reconstruction had collapse, Barksdale won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served two terms, but lost reelection in 1886. Upon leaving Congress, Barksdale retired to Yazoo County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74237P4'>Barksdale died on February 17, 1893, at the age of 69. He was married to Alice Jane Harris and had three children. Ethelbert Barksdale was also the younger brother of William Barksdale, a U.S. congressman who became general in the Confederate army, killed at Gettysburg in 1863. Ethelbert Barksdale is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32095430P0'>John Logan Power was a politician, publisher, Confederate soldier, and a secretary of state of Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32095430P1'>Born on March 1, 1834, in Mullinahone, Ireland, Power came to the United States in 1850. He initially lived in New York, but moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1855. He found work as a newspaper printer. After the Civil War broke out in 1861, Power volunteered for Confederate service. He enlisted as a private in a Mississippi artillery unit and steadily increased in rank from sergeant to adjutant. After participating in the Vicksburg Campaign, Power received an officer’s commission and appointment as superintendent of army records by the Confederate government. At the end of the war he held the rank of colonel.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32095430P2'>After the Civil War, Power returned to newspaper printing. He started the <hi rend='italic'>Daily Mississippi Standard</hi> in 1866 which shortly afterwards merged with the <hi rend='italic'>Clarion</hi>. In 1867 Power served as clerk of the Mississippi House of Representatives. He continued his publishing work through the late 1860s and early 1870s, partnering with Ethelbert Barksdale. In 1875 their firm, Power &amp; Barksdale, began a run of several years as the official state printer.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32095430P3'>In 1895 Power was elected secretary of state for Mississippi. He served capably and won reelection in 1899. He passed away on September 24, 1901.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32067513P0'>Albert Talmon Morgan was a Union soldier during the Civil War and a Republican politician in Mississippi during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P1'>Born on June 9, 1842, in Theresa, New York, Morgan moved as a child with his family to Wisconsin. He began attending Oberlin College in Ohio, but left school to volunteer for Union military service at the start of the Civil War. He enlisted in the Second Wisconsin Infantry Regiment, which became part of the famed “Iron Brigade”—a brigade of four midwestern Union regiments known for their broad black hats and bravery in battle. Morgan was wounded and captured at Brawner’s Farm during the opening shots of the Battle of Second Manassas in August 1862, but was exchanged and returned to his unit in time to be wounded again at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. He was repeatedly promoted during the war, eventually reaching the rank of captain in late 1864. When the Second Wisconsin Infantry was so badly depleted due to casualties, Morgan and the remaining members of the regiment were formed into an independent battalion that was eventually placed into the Sixth Wisconsin Infantry Regiment. Morgan was wounded a third time, during fighting near Petersburg, Virginia, but again returned to service to muster out with his unit.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P2'>In November 1865, after separating from the Union army, Morgan moved to Mississippi with his brother Charles. He started a pro-Republican newspaper in Yazoo City and served as a delegate to Mississippi’s constitutional convention in 1868 and 1869. He then won election to the Mississippi Senate in 1869.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P3'>In 1870, Morgan married Carolyn Victoria Highgate, a teacher from Ithaca, New York, who was part African American. Morgan successfully labored within the Mississippi Senate to overturn the state’s laws against interracial marriage in order to legally marry Carolyn. The couple had six children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P4'>While serving as state senator in the early 1870s, Morgan also took the office of chancery clerk in Yazoo County. In 1873, he was ejected from the Senate for holding both positions at the same time. Shortly after losing his Senate seat, Morgan ran for sheriff of Yazoo County. Although he won the election, the incumbent sheriff, Francis P. Hilliard, refused to vacate the office. The dispute led to a deadly confrontation in January 1874, as both men led groups of supporters to take control of the courthouse. During the altercation, Hilliard was shot in the head and killed. Morgan was arrested for the killing and spent several months in jail, but a grand jury decided not to indict him, at least in part because officials believed the fatal shot may have come from a different direction than Morgan. Released from jail and cleared of all charges, Morgan took his place as sheriff.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P5'>Political violence increased in Mississippi in 1874 and 1875, as white conservatives began attacking Black residents and Republicans. Morgan’s efforts to quell the violence failed, and he was chased out of the county after a group of armed men broke apart a Republican meeting in Yazoo County in September 1875. He departed Mississippi in 1876 and testified in U.S. Congressional hearings in Washington, D.C., about the racial violence in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32067513P6'>After leaving Mississippi, Morgan and his family lived in Kansas and then in Colorado. He died on April 15, 1922, in Denver. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P0'>The United States during the nineteenth century saw great increases in literacy and general education. At the beginning of that century, approximately 70 percent of northerners and 60 percent of white southerners could read. By 1840, that number increased to roughly 93 percent of northerners and 80 percent of white southerners. (African American literacy rates were far lower, particularly in the south where many states had laws against teaching slaves and free Black people to read.) After the Civil War, literacy rates continued to rise, most drastically with freed people. In 1870, approximately 20 percent of Black Americans knew how to read. Due to new educational opportunities after emancipation—and despite the lack of support provided to Black schools by many discriminatory local governments—that number nearly tripled within thirty years, with 55 percent of African Americans being literate by 1900.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P1'>The general improvement of literacy and education in the United States spurred an increasing demand for printed information. At the same time, technological developments—such as improved paper production, better transportation and trade routes for the sale of paper and printing supplies, higher quality and faster printing machines, and rapid transmission of information through railroads and eventually telegraph—contributed to a boom in print media. This allowed aspiring newspaper editors to open their own publication in even small towns. In 1830, the United States had around 900 newspapers in publication (nearly double the number found in Great Britain at the same time). Only ten years later, more than 1,600 newspapers were in circulation; and in 1850 that number had grown to more than 2,500. In 1900, there were more than 20,000 American newspapers. Most were weekly publications, but the number of daily newspapers rose from 24 in 1820 to more than 250 in 1850, to more than 2,600 in 1900. Still, the annual numbers of newspapers mentioned above underrepresent the proliferation of print media activity, since they only include active newspaper companies counted during a formal census. Many newspapers lasted only a few months or years, before being replaced or purchased by a competitor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P2'>The nineteenth century also saw drastic improvement in the quality of mass production printing and book binding. This decreased the cost associated with manufacturing books, increased opportunities for writers to publish their work, and improved the amount of printed material for schools and professional organizations outside of the traditional cities and universities. It also increased the role of books as entertainment, rather than their previous primary purpose as sources of religious and academic information.

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P3'>Technological developments greatly improved illustration printing during the nineteenth century. Lithography—a technique of transferring an image from a smooth piece of limestone to paper—had been invented in the 1790s in Bavaria. Over the next century, printers and publishers refined the technique to mass produce increasingly elaborate illustrations, including in color. The process still required an artist to produce, or reproduce, an image on limestone or specially prepared metal plate. However, average Americans were able to purchase highly decorative prints, books, calendars, and magazines. Lithography also revolutionized advertising during the latter part of the nineteenth century, as printers could produce elaborate advertisements for stores and other businesses.

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P4'>Overall, the nineteenth century was a sort of golden era of print media. While printing and publishing continued to be a vital part of American culture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the invention of radio, television, and the internet reduced Americans’ reliance upon paper-based newspapers, magazines, and books for information and entertainment.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD73740P0'>People with disabilities are defined as those people experiencing "any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society" (Wikipedia). People with disabilities in nineteenth-century America faced a variety of different options and experiences based on both their region, age, and specific disability.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P1'>Early in the nineteenth century, many communities saw supporting people with disabilities as a local matter; however, as the nineteenth century progressed and cities and their populations (including people with disabilities) grew exponentially, many state governments took responsibility for supporting people with disabilities. That support most often took the form of almshouses or hospitals in which residents lived permanently, usually in rural areas for fear of urban environments' negative impacts on health. Different religious, medical, and reform organizations took different approaches to the treatment of disabilities, including the treatment of a person's morals in addition to medical care. Like many other branches of medicine, popular medical understandings of many disabilities remained incorrect and even harmful in the nineteenth century, particularly the concept of eugenics, or the idea that controlling genetics could improve or even perfect humanity. Doctors espousing these beliefs sometimes conducted forced sterilizations and lobotomies on their patients, either to prevent their reproduction or to reduce mental health issues.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD73740P2'>The devastation of the American Civil War and the increase of people with war-related disabilities brought much more attention to the study of disabilities and their treatment, but ultimately humane and ethical methods of caring for people with disabilities remained far in the future. CWRGM adopts the term "People with disabilities" to foreground individuals' personhood over their status or physical condition (National Park Service; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD102248P0'>The term "blindness" is used to refer to "complete or nearly complete vision loss" (Wikipedia). Like many other disabilities, the treatment of blind persons in the United States transitioned from local to institutional across the nineteenth century. Many philosophers and intellectuals in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries debated the role of blindness in society and the level to which blind persons could be rehabilitated or integrated into broader society. While eighteenth-century Americans primarily viewed the education and care of the blind as a matter for individual communities to craft responses for, by the 1830s state-funded institutes for the education of the blind arose in many American cities. Samuel Gridley Howe developed one of the first of these in Boston in 1831, known as the New England Institution for the Education of the Blind. Such schools enjoyed enormous success in teaching blind persons to read, write, and integrate into the broader community. Indeed, some institutes for the education of blind persons developed rich academic and intellectual cultures in which blind persons helped redefine what it meant to be blind and what limits it ought to entail. While most education for blind persons remained separated from other schools until the twentieth century, the state-sponsored approach to educating blind persons improved living and learning conditions for blind persons throughout the nineteenth century. CWRGM uses the people-first tag "People with disabilities--Blind persons" to emphasize the personhood of those with blindness over their condition (Britannica; Freeburg, <hi rend='italic'>The Meanings of Blindness in Nineteenth-Century America</hi>).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)

I think it was through his influence that a bill of indictment was found. I have known Anderson for Several Years &amp; for five years previous to the Shooting lived on my place, that was the only difficulty, I ever knew him to engaged in. I am satisfied that from all the facts in the case, that the <rs ref='#S25021515'>prosecutor</rs> was more to blame than the defendant. Dixon the prosecutor was three miles from home in daytime, at 12 o clock. <rs ref='#S32084779'>Sneaking about</rs> with his gun when he had no business &amp; in Andersons yard Shot, his dog, and that in Andersons absence. I have stated the facts in this case. And now without going to the trouble &amp; expense and formality of a petition to your Excellency, I ask most respectfully, the interposition, of Executive clemency in behalf of this unfortunate man, he is a <rs ref='#S57096'>negro</rs>, but he is entitled to all the privileges &amp; immunities under the law that a white man would be under the circumstances. It does seem to me that Burrell Anderson has fully atone for his offence first from great suffering from his wounds, &amp; the greater <rs ref='#S102248'>loss of one of his eyes</rs>, and I think about two years in the penitentiary, his term of Sentence was three years. Now dear Sir I ask you in the name of humanity &amp; as <del rend='overstrike'>as</del> an act of justice that you extend to Anderson, the clemency that others have received at your hands, and <rs ref='#S32019844'>set this man free</rs>, that he may return to <rs ref='#S32057055'>his family</rs>.
