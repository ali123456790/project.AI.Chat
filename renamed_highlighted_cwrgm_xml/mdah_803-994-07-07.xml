                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

His regiment participated in military campaigns in Mississippi in 1863 and, in 1864, Noonan was appointed the military mayor of Natchez. He separated from the U.S. Army after the war ended and remained in Mississippi. Noonan held several public jobs in and around Natchez, including sheriff, county treasurer, and alderman. In the 1870s he was appointed superintendent of the Mississippi state penitentiary. His final public position was United States Commissioner for compensation claims against the U.S. government.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32056697P0'>James Hill served in various Mississippi state offices after the Civil War, most notably as secretary of state from 1874 to 1878. He was the last African American to hold a state level office in Mississippi until the twentieth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P1'>Born on the plantation of James Hill in Marshall County, Mississippi, in 1837 or 1838, Hill was referred to as a mulatto in nineteenth century terminology, indicating he was likely biracial. Rumored to be the biological son of the plantation owner (whose name he shared), Hill was legally a slave under policies that established a child inherited the labor status of the mother. As he grew, Hill reportedly was taught how to read by the slave owner’s two white daughters, and he subsequently acquired machining skills at railroad shops in Holly Springs. He earned a reputation as a first-class mechanic.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P2'>Upon gaining his freedom after the Civil War, Hill’s previous education and technical skills made him a strong candidate for new opportunities for African Americans in Republican Reconstruction. He received an appointment as land registrar of Mississippi in 1867 and a year later was elected to the Mississippi state legislature. During his term as a legislator, he helped elect Hiram Revels to the U.S. Senate—the first African American to serve in that position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P3'>In 1873, African American voters in Mississippi helped elect a series of candidates dedicated to racial equality, including northern-born Republican Adelbert Ames as Mississippi governor and Black attorney Alexander K. Davis as lieutenant governor. Hill was elected Mississippi’s secretary of state. Democrats in Mississippi almost immediately conducted a campaign of violence and intimidation against Republican and Black voters, sweeping several subsequent elections and stacking the Mississippi legislature with white supremacist representatives by 1875. The conservative Democrats in office tried clear state Republicans from top state positions, holding impeachment proceedings against Ames and Davis. Both men were removed from office in early 1876, but Hill retained his seat as secretary of state, and completed his term in 1878.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32056697P4'>He remained in public service, serving as district internal revenue collector and then postmaster in Vicksburg, appointments given by the president. Following these assignments, Hill served as president of the Mississippi Cotton Manufacturing Company in Jackson. He received one more appointment, in the United States General Land Office in Jackson in 1900. Three years later, in February 1903, he started the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi State Register</hi>, a weekly newspaper that advocated racial harmony. Unfortunately, he died of heart failure less than six months later. Hill never married or had children. He is buried in Mount Olive Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P0'>When the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, it failed to abolish involuntary servitude. The amendment included a loophole banning involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted" (Library of Congress). White southerners in the post-emancipation South, concerned about both the availability of labor and the freedom of African Americans, manipulated this clause and turned to convict leasing to entrench long standing racial hierarchies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P1'>Immediately after the war, many states passed "Black Codes" or laws severely limiting African Americans' rights. Under these codes and other similar laws passed in the decades following the Civil War, African Americans could be arrested for any number of petty crimes, including vagrancy (functionally construed to mean any act of social mobility not approved by a white person) or theft (in Mississippi a felony if exceeding $10 worth of goods). Widespread racism and stereotypes about Black criminality led to a dramatic expansion in the population of imprisoned individuals and an overwhelming number of African Americans within that population. Many states leased those convicted persons to private companies or individuals for their labor, and in certain cases lessees had been the pre-emancipation enslaver of the leased.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P2'>Laborers worked in a variety of settings including shipbuilding and timber cutting, yet the most prominent form in states like Mississippi remained large-scale agricultural work. The convict lease system was incredibly dangerous and difficult for those who lived through it, as leased persons faced unsafe working conditions, inadequate living conditions, abuse from lessees, and grueling work schedules. Given these circumstances, the ready availability of imprisoned laborers, and the callousness of lessees and state officials, the mortality rate among convict laborers was incredibly high.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P3'>Certain states ceased leasing imprisoned persons to individuals or private companies in the late nineteenth century, only to continue using that labor on state-funded infrastructure projects like road or highway construction until, in some cases, World War II. Southern individuals and states thereby continued to increase their wealth through the coerced labor of African Americans while perpetuating anti-Black racism and laying the foundations of the modern prison-industrial complex (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P0'>In the wake of the Civil War, many states turned to convict leasing to bolster infrastructural repair and to maintain long standing racial hierarchies. Like many other southern states, Mississippi instituted a convict leasing program, and in 1876 the state passed the Leasing Act (commonly known as the “Pig Law”), which sentenced anyone who stole property valued at $10 or greater up to five years in prison and quadrupled the prison population, with Black prisoners comprising approximately 85% of inmates. The state most frequently leased convicted persons to individuals, primarily to perform agricultural work on cotton farms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P1'>However, the state also leased incarcerated persons to private companies, such as the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company, and companies subjected convict-laborers to excruciating working conditions with little shelter, sustenance, or medical care. While companies and private individuals leased enslaved workers during the antebellum era, enslavers expected “their human chattel to be returned alive and in good working condition” (Sturkey, <hi rend='italic'>Hattiesburg</hi>). However, this expectation was virtually nonexistent in postwar convict leasing programs. The death toll therefore grew to staggering heights. In response, Mississippi cancelled Gulf &amp; Ship Island’s contract in December 1888 and ceased leasing convicts to private companies in 1890. However, the state and individual counties and towns continued to use convict labor for public works projects and at the state’s penitentiary at Parchman plantation well into the twentieth century (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32031023P0'>Like many slaveholding states of the former Confederacy, Mississippi operated a convict leasing system between the 1860s–1900s. Under convict leasing systems, states leased imprisoned people to perform unfree labor for companies and individuals in exchange for a fee. State and county laws (such as "Pig Laws" and vagrancy laws) and racially selective prosecutions funneled large, overrepresented populations of African Americans into their prison institutions. Therefore, Mississippi's convict leasing system replaced the state's former system of race-based chattel slavery and laborers encountered harsh conditions, violent punishments, and high death tolls. Public outcry over these conditions, especially following the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company's convict leasing practices, forced Mississippi to abolish its convict leasing program in 1890, becoming the first state to do so. County governments, however, continued to operate convict leasing arrangements using chain gangs until the 1900s. In 1904 Mississippi opened Parchman Prison on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta and consolidated much of its convict labor there. (Mississippi Encyclopedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.
