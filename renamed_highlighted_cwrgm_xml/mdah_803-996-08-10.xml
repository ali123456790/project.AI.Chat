                    <p xml:id='OTPS32025383P0'>Jefferson Llewellyn Wofford was a farmer, lawyer, Confederate Army officer, newspaper editor, and U.S. postmaster.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025383P1'>Born on November 4, 1834 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Wofford was a farmer and lawyer living in Lexington, Holmes County, Mississippi by 1860. During the Civil War, he enlisted in the Confederate Army, serving as a private in Kentucky and Tennessee. By 1862, sickness prompted him to return to Mississippi, where he served as a captain in the 1st Mississippi Light Artillery. Due to his success in repulsing U.S. General William T. Sherman's initial advance towards Vicksburg, Mississippi at Chickasaw Bayou, he was promoted to the rank of major of the 1st Louisiana Artillery. Wofford was captured and imprisoned following the fall of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863 but was exchanged. He was assigned chief of artillery for the Department of Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and part of Louisiana. In April 1865, Wofford was captured in Blakeley, Alabama, carrying the rank of colonel. He was imprisoned in Fort Blakely but was paroled on June 15, 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025383P2'>After the war, he returned to Mississippi, settling in Corinth, Mississippi, where he worked as a lawyer. A member of the Republican Party, on April 8, 1869, he was appointed U.S. Postmaster. However, he was suspended in August 1869, and he became the editor for the <hi rend='italic'>Corinth News</hi>. In 1870, Wofford ran for Mississippi state representative for Tishomingo County but continued his work as a newspaper editor at least through 1875. In 1877, he was once again appointed U.S. Postmaster for Corinth.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32025383P3'>Wofford was married to Octavia (Torrey) Wofford, who preceded him in death in 1890. The pair had five children, including three sons and one daughter who lived to adulthood. Jefferson Llewellyn Wofford died on July 4, 1911 just outside Charlottesville, Virginia and was buried in the Monte Vista Memorial Park in Johnson City, Washington County, Tennessee.

                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32014839P0'>Bartley Barry Boone was an attorney, Confederate officer, and district judge in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32014839P1'>Born on April 6, 1831, Boone studied law and became a successful attorney in Mississippi. He entered state politics in the 1850s, serving in the Mississippi House of Representatives and participating in Democratic party conventions as a delegate from Tishomingo in the 1850s. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Boone volunteered for Confederate service. He helped raise a company of volunteers, known as the Tishomingo Riflemen, and was then commissioned as an officer in the Second Mississippi Infantry Regiment.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32014839P2'>Boone was the highest Confederate officer captured by Union troops at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. The incident occurred in part due to the irregular uniforms worn by Union and Confederate soldiers during the first major engagement of the Civil War. When soldiers of the First Minnesota Infantry Regiment, wearing red shirts, opened fire on Boone’s Second Mississippi Infantry, he mistook them for the Fourth Alabama Infantry Regiment, which also wore red shirts. Boone rode his horse to the red-shirted infantrymen and ordered them to cease firing on their “friends.” Only when he suddenly found a bayonet at his chest and a demand to surrender did Boone realize his mistake.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32014839P3'>Boone survived the Civil War and was again elected to the Mississippi legislature in 1865. In 1866, he was appointed the Ninth Judicial Circuit. Beyond his judicial and legal work, Boone also helped establish the town of Booneville, Mississippi, with land he purchased with G. W. Williams, and W. P. Curlee from members of the Chickasaw Nation. He died in 1905 in that town. Boone was married twice, first to Lou M. Petty, who passed away in 1861. He then married Margaret Petty. He had at least three children who survived to adulthood. Boone is buried in Booneville Cemetery in Booneville, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.
