                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

<p xml:id='OTPS32077786P1'>His origins are unclear, but by March 1873, Rhodes was living in Jackson, Mississippi and was a correspondent for the <hi rend='italic'>Jackson Pilot</hi>. A member of the Republican Party, in May 1875, he became Mississippi State Governor Adelbert Ames's Private Secretary. In December that year, he also became a Trustee of the Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum, and he held this position at least through February 1877. In March 1876, Governor Ames resigned. Rhodes continued briefly as the governor's private secretary, but he too resigned at the end of April 1876. After February 1877, his name no longer appeared in Mississippi newspapers regarding political or social activities, and his fate is unclear.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P0'>Voting is the activity of choosing someone or something in an election. The United States Constitution left the states with the responsibility of managing elections, leading to a wide variety of voting practices. Initially, the two most common forms of voting in the United States involved voice vote and paper ballots. Most paper ballots during the early nineteenth century through the Civil War involved “party tickets,” which included the names of candidates of only one party. The voter provided the ballot to election officials, meaning voting was a public display of the voter’s selection. This practice made voters more susceptible to public pressure or intimidation during contentious elections or in communities dominated by one political party. During Reconstruction, some communities began using blank ballots, also known as the “Australian ballot,” which provided more secrecy for voters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P1'>During the Civil War, many northern states began changing voting practices to account for the thousands of men in the Union army and away from home. Before the war, only Pennsylvania allowed soldiers to vote by mail-in or absentee ballots. The election of 1864 was the first time since 1812 that a presidential election occurred during a war. With so many residents on the war front, between 1862 and 1864 twenty northern states passed laws to grant their soldiers the right to vote through mail-in ballots. The issue was contentious, in part because many Democrats argued that Republican officials would tamper with the military votes. Democrats were also more aligned with anti-war sentiment and opposition to emancipation of African Americans. Many Democrats feared that frontline soldiers would boost electoral support for the President Abraham Lincoln’s reelection. Indeed, most Union soldiers voted for Lincoln, helping secure his reelection.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P2'>Voting rights changed dramatically in the South after the Civil War. Federal Reconstruction laws prohibited former Confederates from voting until they took a loyalty oath, or, in some cases, appealed to President Andrew Johnson personally. Many ex-Confederates undertook these steps and managed to regain voting rights and run for office shortly after the war. These white officials passed highly discriminatory laws, starting with Mississippi in late 1865, known as the “Black Codes,” which restricted African American rights. Republicans in the U.S. Congress then implemented more oversight in Reconstruction and better protected Black civil rights including the right to vote. This included the passage and ultimate ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited states from denying any person the right to vote based upon race, color, or previous condition of servitude. These protections only covered men, as women were still not allowed to vote in most elections in most states. As a result, African Americans played a large part in southern elections, boosting Republican Party success and leading to African American politicians winning seats in local, state, and national offices. Conservative white voters in the South responded by engaging in voter suppression through violence and intimidation. The “Mississippi Plan” in 1875 was one such effort, which led to a dramatic drop in Republican votes, leading to the Democratic Party takeover of Mississippi’s state legislature.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P3'>The end of Reconstruction in 1877 led to a new wave of restrictions against Black voting in the South. Many southern states began implementing poll taxes, literacy tests, and the “grandfather clause” designed to disenfranchise African American voters. Many southern Blacks could not afford the poll taxes or were not literate enough to pass voter reading requirements. The “grandfather clause” prohibited voting for anyone whose grandfather had not been eligible to vote, a policy aimed directly at the descendants of the formerly enslaved. These laws lasted well into the twentieth century. (Cambridge Dictionary, Smithsonian Institute, National Geographic, Wikipedia, National Archives and Records Administration)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025823P0'>Disenfranchisement is the denial of voting rights for a person or group of people. At the adoption of the United States Constitution in the eighteenth century, only white men over the age of 21 had the right to vote in federal and most state elections. Women and most racial minorities, especially African Americans, were disenfranchised. This changed with the Civil War, as the Union Army began enlisting Black soldiers. Military service was seen by many in the United States as tied to citizenship, and an increasing number of people—especially in the north—argued that Black soldiers had earned the right to vote. When the war ended, Radical Republicans sought to end slavery and break down racial restrictions against voting. White southerners, often led by former Confederates entering postwar political office, sought to disenfranchise Black voters in order to preserve as much of the Old South culture and white supremacy as possible. They passed laws in Mississippi and other parts of the South in late 1865, known as the “Black Codes,” which restricted African American civil rights. Republicans responded with greater federal oversight and passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited states from denying any person the right to vote according to race, color, or previous condition of servitude. These protections did not cover women or people under 21 years of age.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025823P1'>The Republican efforts led to widespread Black voting in the late 1860s and early 1870s, leading to elections of African Americans to many local, state, and some federal offices. Then, in late 1874, conservative white Mississippians enacted the “Mississippi Plan,” which was an organized effort to disenfranchise Black voters through intimidation. The result was a major Democratic victory in the 1875 election, which pushed many Republicans out of office and resulted in the return of racist white policies in Mississippi. Reconstruction ended two years later, in 1877, and Black disenfranchisement increased. Southern governments began implementing laws intended to deny African American voting rights, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and the famous “grandfather clause” which prohibited voting rights for anyone whose grandfather had not enjoyed the right to vote. The first two policies could not disenfranchise all Black voters, as some could read and some were wealthy enough to pay the poll taxes; the two rules also disenfranchised some poor and uneducated white people. The third policy, though, affected nearly the entire Black population, since their grandparents had almost all been slaves and prohibited from voting.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P0'>A paramilitary organization is a group of armed individuals that act in a pseudo-military fashion, but is not an official military unit. Paramilitary groups are often associated with illegal or revolutionary actions, and frequently use guerilla warfare or even terrorism to achieve their objectives. The term paramilitary arose in the twentieth century, however examples of paramilitary-style groups during the Civil War include Missouri Bushwhackers and Kansas Jayhawkers, who engaged in guerilla warfare, and sometimes terrorist or criminal actions, ostensibly for their respective side. Some of these units were eventually accepted into formal military service within the Union and Confederate armies, while others operated with only tacit endorsement by the warring governments.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P1'>Paramilitary groups are more commonly associated to the Reconstruction era, when bands of armed citizens in the south organized to resist state and federal authorities who supported Republican policies. The most well-known examples include the Ku Klux Klan, the White League, and the Red Shirts. The Klan started as a fraternal order in 1865 among former Confederate soldiers in Tennessee but rapidly became a terrorist group, whose members often wore hoods to hide their identities. It became the most famous group dedicated to intimidating Republicans and African Americans in the south to maintain white supremacy. The White League was formed in the early 1870s in Louisiana, but spread openly across the south for the purpose of using violence to intimidate Republican officials and Black southerners who challenged white supremacy. The White League grew so strong as a paramilitary group that it mustered 5,000 members to outnumber and defeat the New Orleans police force and a state militia unit in a battle in New Orleans in 1873. The Red Shirts emerged around 1875 in Mississippi to oppose Republican Reconstruction and, likewise, enforce white supremacy over Black southerners, often through demonstrations at voting centers. These groups, and others in the south during the latter part of the nineteenth century, were organized, armed, and driven by political and social objectives, but were not formal military units or officially part of their state and local governments (even when they were supported by sympathetic officials).

<p xml:id='OTPSD32143645P2'>White supremacist paramilitary groups reversed civil rights progress during the last years of Reconstruction and afterwards, and maintained a steady presence for many years, using intimidation and terrorism, to oppose efforts by white and Black southerners seeking racial equality.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57126P0'>The Ku Klux Klan (KKK or Klan) is a white supremacist organization that became infamous during the Reconstruction era for terrorizing Black families and Republicans in the south. The Klan was created by former Confederates in Tennessee in December 1865 as a social club that mirrored some fraternal organizations from the mid-nineteenth century. It adopted mystic ceremonies, masks, and eventually white hoods that became the trademark appearance for a Klansman. The Klan spread across the south in the late 1860s, but had little organizational structure above local chapters. Although its original founding may have been more recreational than political, by 1867 the KKK began promoting white supremacy in opposition to the expansion of Black civil rights and Republican Reconstruction. Klan members carried out an insurgency in the south, using threats and violence, including destruction of property and assassinations, to achieve its goals. The use of hoods and fanciful costumes added to the mystique of the Klan, as well as protected the identity of its members during their terrorist activities. The Klan’s reputation for violence and intimidation reached the halls of Congress, leading the federal government to pass three pieces of legislation known as the Enforcement Acts in 1870 and 1871. The third Enforcement Act was known as the “Ku Klux Klan Act” due to its provisions making terroristic threats and intimidation to deny civil rights a federal offense. Additionally, state officials that denied Black southerners equal protection of the law could also be taken to federal court. With these laws, federal agents were empowered to arrest and prosecute Klan members, or anyone else charged with using threats or intimidation to suppress civil rights in the south. The Enforcement Laws were effective in disrupting the Klan’s activities, and reinvigorating federal protection of equal rights.  By the mid-1870s the KKK was largely defunct, although it was replaced by other white supremacist organizations. The Klan made a comeback around 1915 and then a third resurgence in the 1950s in response to the Civil Rights movement. It continues to exist in the twenty-first century, but largely as a small, fringe extremist group. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P0'>The Democratic Party is national political party in the United States. It was created in 1828 as a coalition of state political groups who supported Andrew Jackson for national office. Its original principles included support for strong presidential authority, agrarianism, and westward expansionism, while opposing a national bank and high import tariffs. The party enjoyed political success with Jackson’s election to the presidency in 1828 and eventually established itself as a the most powerful political group in the mid-nineteenth century United States, with the younger Whig Party slightly behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P1'>The Democratic Party’s biggest challenge was the issue of slavery. The topic primarily divided American politics along north versus south (or free versus slave state) geographical factions. By 1850, the Democratic Party was largely dominated by southern and pro-slavery figures, who advocated the expansion and protection of the institution. Many northern Democrats adopted a neutral, if not pro-slavery, approach to the slavery debate to maintain party cohesion. Then in 1854, aspiring Democratic politician Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois introduced legislation known as the Kansas-Nebraska Act to strike down the Missouri Compromise, which had prohibited slavery in the western territories above the 36°30′ parallel (a line extending westward from Missouri’s southern border) since 1820. Douglas’ act proposed the principle of “popular sovereignty,” or popular vote by the people, within a territory to determine its slaveholding laws. Strongly supported by southern Democrats, the highly controversial bill passed through the U.S. Congress and was signed into law by Democratic president Franklin Pierce. The sudden introduction of slavery into northern territories restructured American politics. The Whig Party, which had been largely made up of northerners, crumbled as its anti-slavery members flocked to the emerging Republican Party with its strong commitment to prohibiting slavery from the territories. The bill also sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party, as many northern Democrats who had tried to remain neutral on the matter of slavery but now believed the party had given in to pro-slavery demands of its southern members. Additionally, several northern Democratic congressmen lost reelection due to the northern public’s backlash to passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Many disgruntled northern Democrats also joined the Republican Party.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P2'>Unlike the Whigs, the Democratic Party survived the 1850s, but once again fractured during the 1860 presidential election. Demanding better protections for slavery, especially in the face of a surging Republican Party movement in the northern states that nominated Abraham Lincoln, pro-slavery southern Democrats staged a walkout of the party’s national convention. The main party nominated northerner Stephen A. Douglas, while the southern Democrats, many of whom styled their faction as the "states rights" party, held their own competing convention and nominated John C. Breckenridge for president. This divide in the Democratic Party helped Abraham Lincoln win the 1860 presidential election.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P3'>Southern secession sent most southern Democrats into the Confederacy. The national party survived in the northern states, but split into two factions during the Civil War: the War Democrats and the Peace Democrats. The War Democrats were strongly anti-secession and generally approved of the Lincoln administration’s military efforts. Peace Democrats largely opposed the Lincoln administration and recommended negotiation to restore the Union, if not outright Confederate statehood. During the 1864 election, Republicans who supported Lincoln rebranded themselves the National Union Party to draw votes from War Democrats who would otherwise not support an openly Republican ticket. The effort worked, in part due to the National Union Party nominating Democrat Andrew Johnson for vice president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P4'>After the Civil War, former Confederates boosted the Democratic Party’s numbers in the United States. In the south during Reconstruction, the Democratic Party labored to limit African American rights and preserve white supremacy in southern society. In late 1874, conservative whites in Mississippi began the “Mississippi Plan” to regain Democratic control of the state government. Over the next several months, and particularly during the 1875 election, Democrats secured political power in Mississippi, in large part through voter suppression and intimidation aimed at African Americans and Republicans. A year later, when New York Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote in the 1876 presidential election, Republicans contested the results with accusations of voter fraud. During tense debates, Democrat leaders agreed to accept the election of the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, if Republicans would end Reconstruction in the South. This agreement led to the withdrawal of federal troops from the south, the domination of southern politics by the Democratic Party, and the elimination of many African American civil rights in that region.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63188P0'>The Republican Party is a national political party in the United States. It was formed in 1854 in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved previous restrictions to slavery in the western territories of the United States. Anti-slavery members of the Whig and Democratic political parties broke from these groups and joined with members of the singularly focused Free Soil Party to develop a major third party challenger for national politics. The Republican Party strongly opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories but did not advocate for the immediate abolition of slavery in the country. The party was more successful than the preceding Free Soil party because it developed a broader political platform than the territorial issue, adopting Whig-inspired economic principles. The growing success of the Republicans in the late 1850s caused the Whig Party to collapse.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P1'>Republicans ran their first presidential candidate in 1856, John C. Frémont. He lost to Democratic candidate James Buchanan, but came in second in a three-way race, winning 11 northern states. Republicans did win congressional and some state elections, and by the 1860 presidential election had established themselves as the most dominant party within the free states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P2'>The Republican Party nominated Abraham Lincoln for president in 1860. The party’s platform included the declaration that “the normal condition of all the territory of the United States is that of freedom,” and included several other criticisms of slavery. Lincoln and the Republican Party clarified that the federal government could not interfere with slavery in the southern states, but their overt anti-slavery position alarmed southerners who saw the Republicans as a fundamental threat to southern way of life. Southern politicians warned of disunion should Lincoln win, and the 1860 election turned into a contest among four candidates. The Democratic Party split along north-south sectional lines, and Lincoln did not appear on presidential ballots in most slaveholding states. Still, Lincoln and the Republicans won the 1860 presidential election with only northern (free state) votes. The election victory sparked a secessionist movement in the south, even before Lincoln took office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P3'>Lincoln and the Republican Party led the federal government against secession and through the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865. The party fractured some during the war over differences of abolition and punishment of the south. Party members who harbored greater interests in abolition, African American rights, and punishing Confederates became known as the Radical Republicans. Lincoln remained more moderate. He advocated more leniency to former Confederates, and was slower to adopt policies that forced social change within the country.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P4'>When Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, Radical Republicans sought to punish the south and enforce their more extreme policies. Andrew Johnson, the vice president who entered the presidency upon Lincoln’s death, opposed the Radicals. However, his policies frustrated many moderate Republicans, and the party took a more forceful role in southern civil and political affairs when former Confederates tried to limit the rights of African Americans during Reconstruction. The Republican Party had a presence within the south during Reconstruction, but mostly among African Americans and northerners who traveled south for political or economic reasons. The party was still seen by most white southerners as a northern party oppressing the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P5'>By 1868 most of the Republican Party had turned on Johnson, even impeaching him. War hero Ulysses S. Grant was then elected as the Republican Party candidate in 1868 with support from the radicals. His administration faced accusations of corruption, especially in the south and the west. By the 1876 election, national support for Reconstruction was low, and initial voter counts appeared to show the Democratic candidate the winner. Republicans in Congress complained of voter intimidation in the south and after tense political negotiations with Democrats managed to have the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes declared the winner with the agreement to end Reconstruction in the south.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
