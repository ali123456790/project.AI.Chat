                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32082683P0'>Mass racial violence has persisted throughout the history of the United States and has roots in the country's founding principles of racialized slavery and racial segregation. In essence, mass racial violence is when one group of people stigmatizes another group based on racialized myths and then weaponizes this stigmatization to inflict violence to intimidate and control those groups of people. From the earliest days of European colonization, Indigenous peoples were subjected to violence and displacement, and this pattern of violence continued against African Americans during the period of slavery and into the Jim Crow era, as well as against immigrant populations throughout United States history. Mass racial violence has taken many forms, including lynchings, massacres, riots, and police brutality. Mass racial violence has been perpetrated by both individuals and groups, and it has been motivated by a variety of factors, including racism, economic inequality, and political extremism. Examples of mass racial violence include the Wilmington Race Riot of 1898, the Red Summer of 1919, the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, and the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, though mass racial violence has happened all over the United States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P0'>This subject tag includes references to various and unidentified state and local elections held within Mississippi. During the Civil War, most Mississippians supported secession and the Confederacy and therefore voted in favor of policies and for candidates dedicated to those causes. After the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, President Andrew Johnson instituted a lenient Reconstruction policy that offered amnesty to individuals who took an oath of loyalty to the United States (with exceptions for certain upper-class southerners). This policy allowed many former Confederates to run for office shortly after the end of the war and pass legislation designed to limit the rights of freed African Americans, known as the Black Codes. Restrictions against black political rights led Republicans in the U.S. Congress to take a firmer hand in Mississippi’s Reconstruction and protect Black rights. Between 1867 and 1876, Republicans backed by federal soldiers struggled to ensure Black Mississippians had equal voting rights and could run for office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P1'>Many white southern conservatives, however, used threats and violence to prevent Black Mississippians and white Republicans from voting, or influence the results of elections. These efforts reached a peak in 1874 under the “Mississippi Plan,” which began with a systematic effort to disenfranchise Black voters in Mississippi and evict African American and Republican office holders. As many as three hundred Black people were killed in Vicksburg in the racial violence. President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to Vicksburg to enforce the law, but soldiers were unable to change the political climate within the state. White Democrats organized under the Mississippi Plan suppressed Black and Republican voters enough to dominate state elections in 1875 by 30,000 votes. Reconstruction ended in 1877 with white conservatives still in command of Mississippi’s state and local politics.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32097921P0'>The election of 1875 was fraught with racial violence. The Democratic Party, which was overwhelmingly comprised of white Mississippians, carried out what was called the "white line" campaign, in which white Mississippians inflicted violence against Black Americans who attempted to exercise their right to vote. White mob violence largely prevented Black Americans and other Republicans from participating in the election of 1875, which allowed for a widespread victory for Democrats in Mississippi that year.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P0'>Voting is the activity of choosing someone or something in an election. The United States Constitution left the states with the responsibility of managing elections, leading to a wide variety of voting practices. Initially, the two most common forms of voting in the United States involved voice vote and paper ballots. Most paper ballots during the early nineteenth century through the Civil War involved “party tickets,” which included the names of candidates of only one party. The voter provided the ballot to election officials, meaning voting was a public display of the voter’s selection. This practice made voters more susceptible to public pressure or intimidation during contentious elections or in communities dominated by one political party. During Reconstruction, some communities began using blank ballots, also known as the “Australian ballot,” which provided more secrecy for voters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P1'>During the Civil War, many northern states began changing voting practices to account for the thousands of men in the Union army and away from home. Before the war, only Pennsylvania allowed soldiers to vote by mail-in or absentee ballots. The election of 1864 was the first time since 1812 that a presidential election occurred during a war. With so many residents on the war front, between 1862 and 1864 twenty northern states passed laws to grant their soldiers the right to vote through mail-in ballots. The issue was contentious, in part because many Democrats argued that Republican officials would tamper with the military votes. Democrats were also more aligned with anti-war sentiment and opposition to emancipation of African Americans. Many Democrats feared that frontline soldiers would boost electoral support for the President Abraham Lincoln’s reelection. Indeed, most Union soldiers voted for Lincoln, helping secure his reelection.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P2'>Voting rights changed dramatically in the South after the Civil War. Federal Reconstruction laws prohibited former Confederates from voting until they took a loyalty oath, or, in some cases, appealed to President Andrew Johnson personally. Many ex-Confederates undertook these steps and managed to regain voting rights and run for office shortly after the war. These white officials passed highly discriminatory laws, starting with Mississippi in late 1865, known as the “Black Codes,” which restricted African American rights. Republicans in the U.S. Congress then implemented more oversight in Reconstruction and better protected Black civil rights including the right to vote. This included the passage and ultimate ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited states from denying any person the right to vote based upon race, color, or previous condition of servitude. These protections only covered men, as women were still not allowed to vote in most elections in most states. As a result, African Americans played a large part in southern elections, boosting Republican Party success and leading to African American politicians winning seats in local, state, and national offices. Conservative white voters in the South responded by engaging in voter suppression through violence and intimidation. The “Mississippi Plan” in 1875 was one such effort, which led to a dramatic drop in Republican votes, leading to the Democratic Party takeover of Mississippi’s state legislature.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P3'>The end of Reconstruction in 1877 led to a new wave of restrictions against Black voting in the South. Many southern states began implementing poll taxes, literacy tests, and the “grandfather clause” designed to disenfranchise African American voters. Many southern Blacks could not afford the poll taxes or were not literate enough to pass voter reading requirements. The “grandfather clause” prohibited voting for anyone whose grandfather had not been eligible to vote, a policy aimed directly at the descendants of the formerly enslaved. These laws lasted well into the twentieth century. (Cambridge Dictionary, Smithsonian Institute, National Geographic, Wikipedia, National Archives and Records Administration)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25025823P0'>Disenfranchisement is the denial of voting rights for a person or group of people. At the adoption of the United States Constitution in the eighteenth century, only white men over the age of 21 had the right to vote in federal and most state elections. Women and most racial minorities, especially African Americans, were disenfranchised. This changed with the Civil War, as the Union Army began enlisting Black soldiers. Military service was seen by many in the United States as tied to citizenship, and an increasing number of people—especially in the north—argued that Black soldiers had earned the right to vote. When the war ended, Radical Republicans sought to end slavery and break down racial restrictions against voting. White southerners, often led by former Confederates entering postwar political office, sought to disenfranchise Black voters in order to preserve as much of the Old South culture and white supremacy as possible. They passed laws in Mississippi and other parts of the South in late 1865, known as the “Black Codes,” which restricted African American civil rights. Republicans responded with greater federal oversight and passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited states from denying any person the right to vote according to race, color, or previous condition of servitude. These protections did not cover women or people under 21 years of age.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25025823P1'>The Republican efforts led to widespread Black voting in the late 1860s and early 1870s, leading to elections of African Americans to many local, state, and some federal offices. Then, in late 1874, conservative white Mississippians enacted the “Mississippi Plan,” which was an organized effort to disenfranchise Black voters through intimidation. The result was a major Democratic victory in the 1875 election, which pushed many Republicans out of office and resulted in the return of racist white policies in Mississippi. Reconstruction ended two years later, in 1877, and Black disenfranchisement increased. Southern governments began implementing laws intended to deny African American voting rights, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and the famous “grandfather clause” which prohibited voting rights for anyone whose grandfather had not enjoyed the right to vote. The first two policies could not disenfranchise all Black voters, as some could read and some were wealthy enough to pay the poll taxes; the two rules also disenfranchised some poor and uneducated white people. The third policy, though, affected nearly the entire Black population, since their grandparents had almost all been slaves and prohibited from voting.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P0'>The Democratic Party is national political party in the United States. It was created in 1828 as a coalition of state political groups who supported Andrew Jackson for national office. Its original principles included support for strong presidential authority, agrarianism, and westward expansionism, while opposing a national bank and high import tariffs. The party enjoyed political success with Jackson’s election to the presidency in 1828 and eventually established itself as a the most powerful political group in the mid-nineteenth century United States, with the younger Whig Party slightly behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P1'>The Democratic Party’s biggest challenge was the issue of slavery. The topic primarily divided American politics along north versus south (or free versus slave state) geographical factions. By 1850, the Democratic Party was largely dominated by southern and pro-slavery figures, who advocated the expansion and protection of the institution. Many northern Democrats adopted a neutral, if not pro-slavery, approach to the slavery debate to maintain party cohesion. Then in 1854, aspiring Democratic politician Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois introduced legislation known as the Kansas-Nebraska Act to strike down the Missouri Compromise, which had prohibited slavery in the western territories above the 36°30′ parallel (a line extending westward from Missouri’s southern border) since 1820. Douglas’ act proposed the principle of “popular sovereignty,” or popular vote by the people, within a territory to determine its slaveholding laws. Strongly supported by southern Democrats, the highly controversial bill passed through the U.S. Congress and was signed into law by Democratic president Franklin Pierce. The sudden introduction of slavery into northern territories restructured American politics. The Whig Party, which had been largely made up of northerners, crumbled as its anti-slavery members flocked to the emerging Republican Party with its strong commitment to prohibiting slavery from the territories. The bill also sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party, as many northern Democrats who had tried to remain neutral on the matter of slavery but now believed the party had given in to pro-slavery demands of its southern members. Additionally, several northern Democratic congressmen lost reelection due to the northern public’s backlash to passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Many disgruntled northern Democrats also joined the Republican Party.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P2'>Unlike the Whigs, the Democratic Party survived the 1850s, but once again fractured during the 1860 presidential election. Demanding better protections for slavery, especially in the face of a surging Republican Party movement in the northern states that nominated Abraham Lincoln, pro-slavery southern Democrats staged a walkout of the party’s national convention. The main party nominated northerner Stephen A. Douglas, while the southern Democrats, many of whom styled their faction as the "states rights" party, held their own competing convention and nominated John C. Breckenridge for president. This divide in the Democratic Party helped Abraham Lincoln win the 1860 presidential election.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P3'>Southern secession sent most southern Democrats into the Confederacy. The national party survived in the northern states, but split into two factions during the Civil War: the War Democrats and the Peace Democrats. The War Democrats were strongly anti-secession and generally approved of the Lincoln administration’s military efforts. Peace Democrats largely opposed the Lincoln administration and recommended negotiation to restore the Union, if not outright Confederate statehood. During the 1864 election, Republicans who supported Lincoln rebranded themselves the National Union Party to draw votes from War Democrats who would otherwise not support an openly Republican ticket. The effort worked, in part due to the National Union Party nominating Democrat Andrew Johnson for vice president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P4'>After the Civil War, former Confederates boosted the Democratic Party’s numbers in the United States. In the south during Reconstruction, the Democratic Party labored to limit African American rights and preserve white supremacy in southern society. In late 1874, conservative whites in Mississippi began the “Mississippi Plan” to regain Democratic control of the state government. Over the next several months, and particularly during the 1875 election, Democrats secured political power in Mississippi, in large part through voter suppression and intimidation aimed at African Americans and Republicans. A year later, when New York Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote in the 1876 presidential election, Republicans contested the results with accusations of voter fraud. During tense debates, Democrat leaders agreed to accept the election of the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, if Republicans would end Reconstruction in the South. This agreement led to the withdrawal of federal troops from the south, the domination of southern politics by the Democratic Party, and the elimination of many African American civil rights in that region.
</p>

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P.
