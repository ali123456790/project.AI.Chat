                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32082683P0'>Mass racial violence has persisted throughout the history of the United States and has roots in the country's founding principles of racialized slavery and racial segregation. In essence, mass racial violence is when one group of people stigmatizes another group based on racialized myths and then weaponizes this stigmatization to inflict violence to intimidate and control those groups of people. From the earliest days of European colonization, Indigenous peoples were subjected to violence and displacement, and this pattern of violence continued against African Americans during the period of slavery and into the Jim Crow era, as well as against immigrant populations throughout United States history. Mass racial violence has taken many forms, including lynchings, massacres, riots, and police brutality. Mass racial violence has been perpetrated by both individuals and groups, and it has been motivated by a variety of factors, including racism, economic inequality, and political extremism. Examples of mass racial violence include the Wilmington Race Riot of 1898, the Red Summer of 1919, the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, and the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, though mass racial violence has happened all over the United States.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32089420P0'>The Clinton Riot (Massacre) of 1875 embodied the violent racial politics that spelled the end of Reconstruction in Mississippi. In preparation for that November's elections, Mississippi's Republican Party scheduled political rallies throughout the state to be held on September 4, 1875, one of which was to be at Clinton, Mississippi, roughly ten miles west of the state capital at Jackson. As a token of good faith, the Republicans invited Democratic speakers to the rally as well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32089420P1'>Political rallies in the nineteenth century often featured large barbecues, impassioned speakers, and generous portions of alcohol, and the rally at Clinton was no different. While the organizers banned alcohol from the premises, the roughly seventy-five whites out of an estimated 1,500-2,500 people in attendance brought it anyway. Democratic speaker Amos R. Johnston spoke in peace, yet Republican H. T. Fisher faced hecklers in the crowd. Despite efforts to cool tensions, whites in attendance (members of the racist paramilitary White Line group) opened fire on the crowd. Chaos ensued and left three whites and five Blacks, including two children, dead.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32089420P2'>The violence continued over the next few weeks, as White Liners massacred and lynched Black and white Republicans in the area regardless of their participation in the Clinton rally. The Clinton Riot opened what white Democrats dubbed the "Mississippi Plan" in which white Democrats would resort to widespread violence in order to remove African Americans and Republicans generally from the state's electoral politics. President Ulysses S. Grant famously refused to send federal aid to restore order to Mississippi's capital, signaling the retreat of the federal government from protecting the rights of African Americans won through the Civil War and Reconstruction. The Clinton Riot thereby represents an episode of mass racial violence targeted at African Americans that signaled the nation's growing complicity in the development of what would become the Jim Crow system of segregation.
