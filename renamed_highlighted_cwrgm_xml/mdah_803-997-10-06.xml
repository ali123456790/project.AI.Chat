                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS71951P0'>James Ronald Chalmers was a Confederate officer and served as a U.S. Representative for Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P1'>Born in Halifax County, Virginia, on January 11, 1831, Chalmers moved with his family to Mississippi during his youth, settling in Holly Springs. After graduating from South Carolina College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in Holly Springs in 1853. Five years later, he was elected district attorney. He was selected as a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in 1861, and helped pass the ordinance of secession which declared the state separate from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P2'>At the outbreak of the Civil War, Chalmers volunteered for military service. He was first commissioned as a captain the Confederate army and soon received a promotion to colonel of the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. After commanding Confederate troops at Pensacola, Florida, Chalmers was promoted again, to brigadier general. He performed well during the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 and again during the Battle of Murfreesboro from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. In 1864, he fought in western Tennessee, including the Battle of Fort Pillow, which involved Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest murdering several African American Union prisoners. In 1865, he was placed in charge of all Mississippi cavalry in the Mississippi and western Tennessee region. He surrendered to Union forces in Alabama in May 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P3'>After the Civil War, Chalmers returned to Mississippi and resumed practicing law. He gained fame among white conservatives through his opposition to Republican Reconstruction, and led an armed group of Democrats to Friar’s Point in 1876 to chase away the sheriff and intimidate African Americans in the area. That same year he won a state senate seat. When Mississippi was readmitted to the Union, Chalmers won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1877 to 1880. Although he again won reelection in 1880, his Republican opponent, John R. Lynch, disputed the election results. A Congressional investigation found in favor for Lynch, but not until 1882 after Chalmers had served most of the term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P4'>Around 1882, Chalmers broke with the traditional Democratic Party in Mississippi. He ran for reelection in 1882, but as an Independent Democrat with support from some Republicans and the Greenback Party (which was a third-party political movement that focused on economic matters). A traditional Democrat candidate, Van H. Manning, won the election, but this time Chalmers contested the results. Congress decided in Chalmer’s favor and he reentered Congress in June 1884, but lost reelection later that fall.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS71951P5'>Chalmers returned to practicing law after the 1884 election. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and died on April 29, 1882. He had been married to Rebecca Arthur; the couple had two children. Chalmers is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32169584P0'>John Milton Brown was an African American sheriff in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32169584P1'>Born in Kentucky on August 1, 1853, Brown moved to Ohio and studied at Oberlin College as a young man. He then relocated to Mississippi, where he worked as a teacher and then, in 1873, was elected the first Black sheriff of Coahoma County. Brown was well respected by most of his constituents. However, his tenure as sheriff took place during a resurgence of conservative white political power in Mississippi, and the decline of Republican-led Reconstruction. Paramilitary groups and armed bands of white men increasingly terrorized Black and Republican meetings in 1874 and 1875.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32169584P2'>In October 1875, former governor James Alcorn led an effort against Black political power and rights, and accused Brown with corruption and the crime of embezzling more than $4,500. At a meeting in Coahoma County, tensions rose, despite Brown’s efforts to defend himself against Alcorn’s accusations. Alcorn further warned white citizens in Mississippi that Brown was arming Black residents for a riot at Friar’s Point. Within days, a large force of armed white men converged at Friar’s Point to expel Brown from office and oppose the reported group of armed African Americans. News of the approaching group of white men led some Black residents to pick up arms and assemble at a bridge south of Friar’s Point. The two sides met and after a brief firefight, the larger, more organized whites dispersed Brown and his supporters, chasing them out of Coahoma County. Brown wrote to governor Adelbert Ames, explaining that armed white conservatives had forcibly expelled him from office and were in control of his county. The Republican governor was unable to help, due to similar white conservative attacks in other parts of the state, and fierce Democratic opposition. Shortly afterwards, Brown was officially voted out of office by Democrats, who has used terror to control county politics.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32169584P3'>Having lost his office as sheriff, Brown moved out of Mississippi, settling in Kansas. He assisted Black settlers who came to Kansas from the south, helping raise money and advocating for equal rights. He also sought public office in Kansas, serving as a county clerk in Shawnee County. When the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898, Brown volunteered for military service and received a commission as an officer in the Twenty-third Kansas Volunteers. He participated in a campaign to Cuba. Following that war, Brown returned to Kansas and became a successful farmer. When he passed away on January 11, 1923, Kansas newspapers lamented the loss of a highly respected citizen. He is buried in Topeka Cemetery in Topeka, Kansas.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P0'>The Democratic Party is national political party in the United States. It was created in 1828 as a coalition of state political groups who supported Andrew Jackson for national office. Its original principles included support for strong presidential authority, agrarianism, and westward expansionism, while opposing a national bank and high import tariffs. The party enjoyed political success with Jackson’s election to the presidency in 1828 and eventually established itself as a the most powerful political group in the mid-nineteenth century United States, with the younger Whig Party slightly behind.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P1'>The Democratic Party’s biggest challenge was the issue of slavery. The topic primarily divided American politics along north versus south (or free versus slave state) geographical factions. By 1850, the Democratic Party was largely dominated by southern and pro-slavery figures, who advocated the expansion and protection of the institution. Many northern Democrats adopted a neutral, if not pro-slavery, approach to the slavery debate to maintain party cohesion. Then in 1854, aspiring Democratic politician Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois introduced legislation known as the Kansas-Nebraska Act to strike down the Missouri Compromise, which had prohibited slavery in the western territories above the 36°30′ parallel (a line extending westward from Missouri’s southern border) since 1820. Douglas’ act proposed the principle of “popular sovereignty,” or popular vote by the people, within a territory to determine its slaveholding laws. Strongly supported by southern Democrats, the highly controversial bill passed through the U.S. Congress and was signed into law by Democratic president Franklin Pierce. The sudden introduction of slavery into northern territories restructured American politics. The Whig Party, which had been largely made up of northerners, crumbled as its anti-slavery members flocked to the emerging Republican Party with its strong commitment to prohibiting slavery from the territories. The bill also sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party, as many northern Democrats who had tried to remain neutral on the matter of slavery but now believed the party had given in to pro-slavery demands of its southern members. Additionally, several northern Democratic congressmen lost reelection due to the northern public’s backlash to passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Many disgruntled northern Democrats also joined the Republican Party.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P2'>Unlike the Whigs, the Democratic Party survived the 1850s, but once again fractured during the 1860 presidential election. Demanding better protections for slavery, especially in the face of a surging Republican Party movement in the northern states that nominated Abraham Lincoln, pro-slavery southern Democrats staged a walkout of the party’s national convention. The main party nominated northerner Stephen A. Douglas, while the southern Democrats, many of whom styled their faction as the "states rights" party, held their own competing convention and nominated John C. Breckenridge for president. This divide in the Democratic Party helped Abraham Lincoln win the 1860 presidential election.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P3'>Southern secession sent most southern Democrats into the Confederacy. The national party survived in the northern states, but split into two factions during the Civil War: the War Democrats and the Peace Democrats. The War Democrats were strongly anti-secession and generally approved of the Lincoln administration’s military efforts. Peace Democrats largely opposed the Lincoln administration and recommended negotiation to restore the Union, if not outright Confederate statehood. During the 1864 election, Republicans who supported Lincoln rebranded themselves the National Union Party to draw votes from War Democrats who would otherwise not support an openly Republican ticket. The effort worked, in part due to the National Union Party nominating Democrat Andrew Johnson for vice president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P4'>After the Civil War, former Confederates boosted the Democratic Party’s numbers in the United States. In the south during Reconstruction, the Democratic Party labored to limit African American rights and preserve white supremacy in southern society. In late 1874, conservative whites in Mississippi began the “Mississippi Plan” to regain Democratic control of the state government. Over the next several months, and particularly during the 1875 election, Democrats secured political power in Mississippi, in large part through voter suppression and intimidation aimed at African Americans and Republicans. A year later, when New York Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote in the 1876 presidential election, Republicans contested the results with accusations of voter fraud. During tense debates, Democrat leaders agreed to accept the election of the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, if Republicans would end Reconstruction in the South. This agreement led to the withdrawal of federal troops from the south, the domination of southern politics by the Democratic Party, and the elimination of many African American civil rights in that region.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63188P0'>The Republican Party is a national political party in the United States. It was formed in 1854 in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and dissolved previous restrictions to slavery in the western territories of the United States. Anti-slavery members of the Whig and Democratic political parties broke from these groups and joined with members of the singularly focused Free Soil Party to develop a major third party challenger for national politics. The Republican Party strongly opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories but did not advocate for the immediate abolition of slavery in the country. The party was more successful than the preceding Free Soil party because it developed a broader political platform than the territorial issue, adopting Whig-inspired economic principles. The growing success of the Republicans in the late 1850s caused the Whig Party to collapse.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P1'>Republicans ran their first presidential candidate in 1856, John C. Frémont. He lost to Democratic candidate James Buchanan, but came in second in a three-way race, winning 11 northern states. Republicans did win congressional and some state elections, and by the 1860 presidential election had established themselves as the most dominant party within the free states.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P2'>The Republican Party nominated Abraham Lincoln for president in 1860. The party’s platform included the declaration that “the normal condition of all the territory of the United States is that of freedom,” and included several other criticisms of slavery. Lincoln and the Republican Party clarified that the federal government could not interfere with slavery in the southern states, but their overt anti-slavery position alarmed southerners who saw the Republicans as a fundamental threat to southern way of life. Southern politicians warned of disunion should Lincoln win, and the 1860 election turned into a contest among four candidates. The Democratic Party split along north-south sectional lines, and Lincoln did not appear on presidential ballots in most slaveholding states. Still, Lincoln and the Republicans won the 1860 presidential election with only northern (free state) votes. The election victory sparked a secessionist movement in the south, even before Lincoln took office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P3'>Lincoln and the Republican Party led the federal government against secession and through the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865. The party fractured some during the war over differences of abolition and punishment of the south. Party members who harbored greater interests in abolition, African American rights, and punishing Confederates became known as the Radical Republicans. Lincoln remained more moderate. He advocated more leniency to former Confederates, and was slower to adopt policies that forced social change within the country.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P4'>When Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, Radical Republicans sought to punish the south and enforce their more extreme policies. Andrew Johnson, the vice president who entered the presidency upon Lincoln’s death, opposed the Radicals. However, his policies frustrated many moderate Republicans, and the party took a more forceful role in southern civil and political affairs when former Confederates tried to limit the rights of African Americans during Reconstruction. The Republican Party had a presence within the south during Reconstruction, but mostly among African Americans and northerners who traveled south for political or economic reasons. The party was still seen by most white southerners as a northern party oppressing the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P5'>By 1868 most of the Republican Party had turned on Johnson, even impeaching him. War hero Ulysses S. Grant was then elected as the Republican Party candidate in 1868 with support from the radicals. His administration faced accusations of corruption, especially in the south and the west. By the 1876 election, national support for Reconstruction was low, and initial voter counts appeared to show the Democratic candidate the winner. Republicans in Congress complained of voter intimidation in the south and after tense political negotiations with Democrats managed to have the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes declared the winner with the agreement to end Reconstruction in the south.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63188P6'>The Republican Party continues to be one of the top two political parties in the United States. (Wikipedia)
