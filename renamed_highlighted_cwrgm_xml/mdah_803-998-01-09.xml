                <note type="article">
                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS52212P0'>James Zachariah George was a Confederate officer and U.S. senator from Mississippi after Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P1'>Born in Monroe County, Georgia, on October 20, 1826, George moved to Mississippi as a child, first to Noxubee County and then to Carroll County. He volunteered for military service in 1846 for the Mexican-American War and served under the command of Colonel Jefferson Davis, who later was elected president of the Confederate States of America. George saw combat at the Battle of Monterey. Following the Mexican-American War, George returned to Mississippi and studied law. He was appointed a reporter of Mississippi’s Supreme Court in 1854 and spent two decades compiling a multi-volume collection of legal cases.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P2'>George was selected to be a delegate to Mississippi’s secession convention in January 1861. He was a slave owner and supported the state’s separation from the Union, following Abraham Lincoln’s election to president in November 1860. When the Civil War erupted in the spring of 1861, George volunteered for military service. He received a commission as captain over Company C, 20th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, but resigned in October 1862 when offered a commission as brigadier general in the Mississippi State Troops. He remained in the state service for one year before rejoining the Confederate army (reportedly due to frustration with the Mississippi militia’s poor organization and resources), taking the rank of colonel to command the 5th Mississippi Cavalry. George was captured by Union forces during the Civil War, and spent time in a prisoner of war camp.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P3'>After the Civil War, George practiced law in Mississippi and formed a very successful law firm with Wiley P. Harris. He was a vocal defendant of white supremacy during Reconstruction, and reportedly influenced Republican Governer Adelbert Ames to not arm African American militias in Mississippi during tensions over the 1875 election. Democrats used promises like this to weaken resistance to a campaign of violence and intimidation against African American and Republican voters. As a result, Democrats scored a major electoral victory in Mississippi, helping overturn federal Reconstruction policies designed to protect Black civil rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P4'>In 1879, George received an appointment to the Mississippi Supreme Court. However, he did not remain there long, since he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1880. He won reelection in 1886 and 1892. He was a vocal proponent for a Mississippi constitutional convention in 1890 to disenfranchise Black southerners, and successfully argued in its defense in front of the Senate and the Supreme Court. George was popular among conservative white Mississippians, in part because he crafted legal exceptions to Mississippi’s voting laws that protect poor whites while denying suffrage to African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52212P5'>George died in 1897 in Mississippi City, Mississippi. He had been married to Elizabeth B. Young. The couple had seven children between 1848 and 1862, five of whom survived to adulthood. George is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in North Carrollton, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS105350P0'>Ulysses S. Grant was a Union general during the Civil War and president of the United States during Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P1'>Born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, Grant’s original name was Hiram Ulysses Grant. Hiram was an ode to his maternal grandfather, but Grant preferred his middle name Ulysses. He attended various private schools and then received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He was mistakenly enrolled under the name Ulysses S. Grant. Grant kept the moniker. Because it was often written as “U. S. Grant,” he gained the nickname “Uncle Sam,” or “Sam,” by fellow cadets.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P2'>Grant was an average student but excelled in horse riding. He graduated in 1843 and was commissioned as an officer in the Fourth Infantry Regiment in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1844, he met Julia Dent, the sister of a West Point classmate and soon became engaged, before he was moved to a new post. From 1846 to 1848, Grant served in the Mexican-American War seeing action in many different battles and receiving two brevet (honorary) promotions for bravery. Upon returning from the war, in 1848, Grant married Julia. The couple eventually had four children.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P3'>After the Mexican-American War, Grant carried out various army assignments, including some in California and the far west. He generally performed well, and was recognized as being a caring and considerate officer. However, in 1854, Grant began to show problems with alcohol, and after warnings by his superior officer, he resigned his military commission in July that year. He returned to his wife in St. Louis, unemployed and with little money. For the next several years, Grant struggled to make money to support his growing family. He tried and failed at farming, real estate sales, and local government service. His father-in-law gifted him a slave, a 35-year old farmhand named William Jones. Despite Grant’s financial despair, he chose to free Jones in 1859, rather than use him for labor or profit from his sale. Grant instead sold personal items, like a gold watch and at one point sold firewood on street corners in St. Louis. Finally, in 1860, he joined his father’s successful leather goods business, operated by his younger brothers in Galena, Illinois, and became financially stable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P4'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Grant volunteered for military service. With his military background, he was made colonel of the Twenty-first Illinois Infantry Regiment, and by July 1861 had been promoted to brigadier general. Showing great aptitude within the rapidly growing Union Army, Grant received another promotion in September 1861 as commander of the District of Southeast Missouri.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P5'>Grant fought his first major battle at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861. While largely a draw, it gave Grant valuable field command experience. Only three months later, he carried out a highly successful campaign against Confederate troops at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. His capture of both positions led to northern newspapers calling him “Unconditional Surrender” Grant and elevated his status in the Union, during a time when other federal armies had faced several defeats.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P6'>Grant was nearly defeated by a large Confederate army in southwestern Tennessee in April 1862, but rallied his force and counterattacked the next day, winning the Battle of Shiloh. The casualty rate shocked many in the north, but President Abraham Lincoln recognized that Grant did not quit in the face of adversity or hardship and endorsed him for higher command. In late 1862 and into 1863, Grant carried out an effort to capture Vicksburg, Mississippi, and help secure the Mississippi River for Union forces. Hindered by Confederate forces, terrain, and the elements, Grant’s army suffered through a long and tiring campaign. Yet, his tenacity and creativity, backed by a superior number of soldiers and competent subordinates like William Tecumseh Sherman, ensured victory. Grant outmaneuvered his opponents, raided Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson, and then besieged a Confederate army in Vicksburg, capturing the city on July 4, 1863, and electrifying northern morale—especially as it occurred a day after a separate Union army defeated Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P7'>Grant followed his success in Mississippi by defeating Confederate forces that had surrounded a Union army in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in 1864 was promoted to lieutenant general and made general-in-chief of the United States Army. He relocated to Virginia and over the next year carried out a bloody advance on the Confederate capital of Richmond. While Robert E. Lee effectively blocked Grant’s initial assaults in northern Virginia, Grant proved undaunted by battlefield defeats. He understood that Union armies could replenish the loss of men and supplies more easily than the Confederacy, and that each massive engagement wore down the Army of Northern Virginia. Indeed, Lee did his best to hold back Grant’s massive army, but in 1865, after months of grueling fighting, and a long siege of Petersburg, the Confederate army was forced to abandon Richmond and retreat to the southwest. Grant’s army cut off Lee’s army, forcing the south’s most famous general to surrender in April 1865 at Appomattox Court House. While several other Confederate armies across the south did not surrender until days or weeks later, Grant’s victory in Virginia effectively signaled the end of the Civil War.

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P8'>Grant remained in the army immediately after the war, working closely with President Andrew Johnson after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination. However, Grant soon split from Johnson on Reconstruction and other policy matters. He was nominated by the Republican Party for president in 1868 and won, entering the White House in 1869. Grant was an honest and empathetic leader, but his administration was marred by corruption. Those controversies overshadowed some of his successes as the nation’s chief executive including greater protections for Black southerners during Reconstruction, signing the Fifteenth Amendment (which protected African American voting rights), greater protection of Native American lands, establishing Yellowstone as a national park, and advocating for civil service reform.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS105350P9'>After serving two terms as president, Grant and his wife went on a two-year world tour. The couple settled in New York City afterwards, when Grant again suffered financial loss due to an investment scam. He developed throat cancer and spent his final months writing his personal memoir. Grant finished writing only a few days before passing away, on July 23, 1885. His memoir was a financial success, providing his widow a large amount of money for retirement, and is largely recognized as one of the best autobiographies in the English language. Grant is buried in the General Grant National Memorial (also known as Grant’s Tomb) in New York City, New York.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P0'>This subject tag includes references to various and unidentified state and local elections held within Mississippi. During the Civil War, most Mississippians supported secession and the Confederacy and therefore voted in favor of policies and for candidates dedicated to those causes. After the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, President Andrew Johnson instituted a lenient Reconstruction policy that offered amnesty to individuals who took an oath of loyalty to the United States (with exceptions for certain upper-class southerners). This policy allowed many former Confederates to run for office shortly after the end of the war and pass legislation designed to limit the rights of freed African Americans, known as the Black Codes. Restrictions against black political rights led Republicans in the U.S. Congress to take a firmer hand in Mississippi’s Reconstruction and protect Black rights. Between 1867 and 1876, Republicans backed by federal soldiers struggled to ensure Black Mississippians had equal voting rights and could run for office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P1'>Many white southern conservatives, however, used threats and violence to prevent Black Mississippians and white Republicans from voting, or influence the results of elections. These efforts reached a peak in 1874 under the “Mississippi Plan,” which began with a systematic effort to disenfranchise Black voters in Mississippi and evict African American and Republican office holders. As many as three hundred Black people were killed in Vicksburg in the racial violence. President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to Vicksburg to enforce the law, but soldiers were unable to change the political climate within the state. White Democrats organized under the Mississippi Plan suppressed Black and Republican voters enough to dominate state elections in 1875 by 30,000 votes. Reconstruction ended in 1877 with white conservatives still in command of Mississippi’s state and local politics.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32097921P0'>The election of 1875 was fraught with racial violence. The Democratic Party, which was overwhelmingly comprised of white Mississippians, carried out what was called the "white line" campaign, in which white Mississippians inflicted violence against Black Americans who attempted to exercise their right to vote. White mob violence largely prevented Black Americans and other Republicans from participating in the election of 1875, which allowed for a widespread victory for Democrats in Mississippi that year.

It was created in 1828 as a coalition of state political groups who supported Andrew Jackson for national office. Its original principles included support for strong presidential authority, agrarianism, and westward expansionism, while opposing a national bank and high import tariffs. The party enjoyed political success with Jackson’s election to the presidency in 1828 and eventually established itself as a the most powerful political group in the mid-nineteenth century United States, with the younger Whig Party slightly behind.

The topic primarily divided American politics along north versus south (or free versus slave state) geographical factions. By 1850, the Democratic Party was largely dominated by southern and pro-slavery figures, who advocated the expansion and protection of the institution. Many northern Democrats adopted a neutral, if not pro-slavery, approach to the slavery debate to maintain party cohesion. Then in 1854, aspiring Democratic politician Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois introduced legislation known as the Kansas-Nebraska Act to strike down the Missouri Compromise, which had prohibited slavery in the western territories above the 36°30′ parallel (a line extending westward from Missouri’s southern border) since 1820. Douglas’ act proposed the principle of “popular sovereignty,” or popular vote by the people, within a territory to determine its slaveholding laws. Strongly supported by southern Democrats, the highly controversial bill passed through the U.S. Congress and was signed into law by Democratic president Franklin Pierce. The sudden introduction of slavery into northern territories restructured American politics. The Whig Party, which had been largely made up of northerners, crumbled as its anti-slavery members flocked to the emerging Republican Party with its strong commitment to prohibiting slavery from the territories. The bill also sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party, as many northern Democrats who had tried to remain neutral on the matter of slavery but now believed the party had given in to pro-slavery demands of its southern members. Additionally, several northern Democratic congressmen lost reelection due to the northern public’s backlash to passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Many disgruntled northern Democrats also joined the Republican Party.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P2'>Unlike the Whigs, the Democratic Party survived the 1850s, but once again fractured during the 1860 presidential election. Demanding better protections for slavery, especially in the face of a surging Republican Party movement in the northern states that nominated Abraham Lincoln, pro-slavery southern Democrats staged a walkout of the party’s national convention. The main party nominated northerner Stephen A. Douglas, while the southern Democrats, many of whom styled their faction as the "states rights" party, held their own competing convention and nominated John C. Breckenridge for president. This divide in the Democratic Party helped Abraham Lincoln win the 1860 presidential election.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P3'>Southern secession sent most southern Democrats into the Confederacy. The national party survived in the northern states, but split into two factions during the Civil War: the War Democrats and the Peace Democrats. The War Democrats were strongly anti-secession and generally approved of the Lincoln administration’s military efforts. Peace Democrats largely opposed the Lincoln administration and recommended negotiation to restore the Union, if not outright Confederate statehood. During the 1864 election, Republicans who supported Lincoln rebranded themselves the National Union Party to draw votes from War Democrats who would otherwise not support an openly Republican ticket. The effort worked, in part due to the National Union Party nominating Democrat Andrew Johnson for vice president.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25012756P4'>After the Civil War, former Confederates boosted the Democratic Party’s numbers in the United States. In the south during Reconstruction, the Democratic Party labored to limit African American rights and preserve white supremacy in southern society. In late 1874, conservative whites in Mississippi began the “Mississippi Plan” to regain Democratic control of the state government. Over the next several months, and particularly during the 1875 election, Democrats secured political power in Mississippi, in large part through voter suppression and intimidation aimed at African Americans and Republicans. A year later, when New York Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote in the 1876 presidential election, Republicans contested the results with accusations of voter fraud. During tense debates, Democrat leaders agreed to accept the election of the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, if Republicans would end Reconstruction in the South. This agreement led to the withdrawal of federal troops from the south, the domination of southern politics by the Democratic Party, and the elimination of many African American civil rights in that region.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71099P0'>The tag "Secessionists" refer to those Americans who supported leaving the Union and establishing an independent Confederate nation. States both North and South had threatened to secede from the United States throughout the nation's history, particularly in New England in 1814 and South Carolina in 1832. However, building tensions between abolitionists and enslavers in the North and South saw an increase in the frequency and fervor of secession threats emanating from southern states in the 1850s. The election of Republican Abraham Lincoln to the presidency in November 1860 provided the impetus many states needed to justify secession. Citing perceived threats to the institution of chattel slavery, on December 20, 1860, South Carolina left the Union, followed by six more lower-South states (Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana) over the next four months.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71099P1'>After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, and Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion on April 15, four more states from the upper-south (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee) seceded. Throughout the war, politicians and military commanders argued fiercely over the constitutionality of secession and debated whether the Confederate states had indeed seceded or instead remained in the Union, though in rebellion. While the fighting of the Civil War functionally ended the Confederacy's effort at secession, the question of those states' status remained an important one for shaping the prosecution of the war and the process of Reconstruction thereafter (HistoryNet).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
