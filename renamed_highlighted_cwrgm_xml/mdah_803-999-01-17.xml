                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32021703P0'>Charles Whittle Clarke was a Union soldier during the Civil War and served as a judge and state representative in Mississippi during Reconstruction. Born in Danville, Vermont, on August 19, 1840, Clarke moved to Ohio as a child. He studied at Hiram College, meeting future Union general and United States president James A. Garfield. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Clarke joined the Forty-second Ohio Infantry Regiment, commanded by Garfield. He participated in numerous battles, including the Vicksburg Campaign in Mississippi. Clarke was promoted to first lieutenant and then captain during the latter half of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021703P1'>After the Civil War, Clarke moved to Mississippi, studied law, and was admitted to the bar (accepted into the legal profession) in 1869. Active in Republican politics, Clarke participated in Mississippi’s constitutional convention of 1868 and soon afterwards took a position as a probate judge and a judge of the court of common pleas. Clarke won an election to the Mississippi legislature in the early 1870s, but shortly thereafter resigned to accept a position as the prosecuting attorney in the “shoestring district” of Mississippi—a gerrymandered congressional district that ran along the Mississippi River and included most of the state’s Black population, which was formed by white supremacists in the state to reduce the polling strength of Black Mississippians.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021703P2'>Clarke remained in Mississippi until 1883, at which point he moved to Kansas City, Missouri. He continued to be active in Republican politics, winning elections to the Missouri legislature in 1896 and 1900. His final public office was surveyor of customs in Missouri.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32021703P3'>Clarke died on March 9, 1915. He was married twice, first to Maria Loveland who died in 1940. His second wife, whom he married in 1906, was Jane Croysdale. Clarke is buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS76359P0'>John H. Nelson was a Confederate officer, lawyer, judge, mayor, and grocery store merchant.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76359P1'>Born in Washington County, Mississippi, Nelson became a lawyer and a Probate Judge in the county before the Civil War. With the outbreak of the war, however, he resigned in order to enlist. He was a Second Lieutenant for the 28th Mississippi Regiment, but a chronic illness forced him to resign within the year.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76359P2'>After the war, Nelson returned to Greenville, Washington County, where he worked as a lawyer and was a co-owner in a grocery and retail firm called Nelson, Trigg, &amp; Co. By 1874, he was the mayor, but he resigned this position in October 1874 and left for St. Louis, Missouri. However, by September the following year, he returned to Greenville, citing St. Louis as "dull and spiritless." At that point, he partnered with S. D. Finlay to open a grocery and retail store. This partnership dissolved two years later in May 1877 when Finlay sold his interest to Nelson. Nelson named his business John H. Nelson &amp; Co.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76359P3'>Nelson died on September 29, 1878 in Greenville, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32083641P0'>The first newspaper published in Mississippi was the <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi Gazette</hi>, which went into print around 1800 in Natchez, before Mississippi Territory was formally organized. Several more appeared during the next few years, and by the time Mississippi entered the Union in 1817 at least half a dozen different publications had emerged. Over the following years, newspaper companies opened as communities grew and the demand for information increased. Publishing resources (like paper and print presses) became more available aiding in the news media boom. By the mid-nineteenth century, most Mississippi towns or counties had a local newspaper, published daily or weekly. Major cities typically had more than one newspaper, often published by competing political parties. Most newspapers went out of business after only a few years; however, a few continued in print for decades, including <hi rend='italic'>The Columbus Democrat</hi> in Columbus (1836–1877), <hi rend='italic'>The Kosciusko Chronicle</hi> in Kosciusko (1846–1892), and the <hi rend='italic'>Grenada Sentinel</hi> of Grenada which started in 1868 and remained in publication until 1955. Overall, as many as two hundred different publishers started daily or weekly newspapers in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69344P0'>Stemming from the first century CE, Christianity is the world's largest religion with over two billion adherents. Its largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. A large influence on American identity and thought since the nation's founding, Christianity (particularly protestant evangelicalism) spread rapidly in the first three decades of the nineteenth century in the United States due to a series of religious revivals known as the Second Great Awakening. Many Americans injected Christian beliefs and practices into many of the major social, political, and legal debates in the country, including debates over slavery (both pro and antislavery stances), education, and social reform. Christianity also became a prominent religion among the enslaved in the United States, who employed Christian rhetoric and belief in much of their social, religious, and cultural activities, and critical to enslaved people's agency and resistance.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69344P1'>American Christianity in the nineteenth century primarily emphasized both one's individual responsibility to God as well as collective responsibility for one's neighbors. Also deeply important to American Christians in the nineteenth century was millennialism, or the belief that Jesus Christ would establish a 1,000 year reign of peace on earth. These combined elements produced efforts at reform with the intent to perfect society in order to invoke that reign. Many of the enslaved, however, applied millennialism to the hope of slavery's abolition. Numerous politicians also incorporated Christian imagery and language to justify "Manifest Destiny," or the idea that the God of Christianity ordained that the United States' borders would extend from the eastern to western coasts of North America, while both the Confederate and United States governments applied Christian rhetoric to support their causes. Christianity existed and still exists in many different and often competing forms, yet the development of those forms came to define much of American culture in the nineteenth century and beyond (Britannica; Howe, <hi rend='italic'>What Hath God Wrought</hi>, 285-327; McPherson, <hi rend='italic'>Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>, 8; Wikipedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32072884P0'>A Presbyterian is a Protestant Christian identifying with "the Reformed tradition within Protestantism that broke away from the Roman Catholic Church" (Wikipedia). Presbyterians believe in Calvinism, or the teachings of sixteenth century theologian John Calvin (1509-1564). While Calvinism contains many doctrinal elements, the most important separating it from other Protestant Christian denominations is that of predestination, or the idea that God has predetermined who will or will not be allowed into Heaven. Presbyterianism derives its name from a form of church government in which decisions are made by councils of elders (or presbyteries). Presbyterians have a long history in the United States dating back to colonial times, and aside from doctrinal and governmental differences from other Protestant churches, are known for having disproportionate wealth and education, leading to conflicts of race, class, gender, and sexuality throughout the nineteenth century and beyond (Britannica; Wikipedia).

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P0'>Medical treatment of wounds and injuries during the nineteenth century was fairly primitive, and not substantially different than medical practices over the preceding few centuries. Doctors had little knowledge of bacteria, and therefore did not understand the importance of washing hands or sterilizing medical instruments when treating open wounds. Physicians learned that some substances seemed to aid recovery, such as iodine and bromine, but their properties were more mystery than scientifically understood. Additionally, antibiotics had not yet been discovered. As a result, even minor cuts could become infected and lead to severe disability or death.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P1'>During the Civil War, more than 475,000 soldiers were wounded in battle.  Thousands more suffered injuries in camp or on the march.  Medical care for wounded and injured soldiers typically involved closing wounds and setting broken bones. After suturing or bandaging these injuries, physicians would carefully observe their patients and try to offer some medical support, but recovery most often depended upon the wounded man’s natural healing. Some medical practices had unintended consequences, both positive and negative. Horsehair proved to be a popular material for sutures, due to its length and strength. To improve its elasticity, Civil War doctors boiled the horsehair, thereby disinfecting it. Wounds stitched closed with boiled horsehair were less likely to grow infected from the sutures, although this benefit was not fully understood until after the war. On the other hand, physicians probing for bullets or foreign objects inside a wound often introduced more bacteria and generated worse infections than the patient may have experienced without the procedure. This practice continued well after the Civil War, and likely contributed to President James Garfield’s death in 1881, when doctors repeatedly used unsterilized fingers and instruments while searching for the assassin’s bullet lodged in his body.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P2'>Doctors understood the danger of blood loss to wounded men, but devices such as the Petit Tourniquet—a French screw-tightened tourniquet designed in 1718—were typically found at a surgeon’s tent rather than with the soldiers along the front lines. Some physicians recommended supplying tourniquets among the soldiers, but others suggested much simpler practices, such as each soldier carrying a handkerchief or cloth strip and a six-inch long piece of wood in his pocket to function as a makeshift tourniquet. These life-saving practices were not mandated among Union and Confederate armies, though, and many wounded men died of blood loss before reaching medical help.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P3'>The most iconic treatment of battlefield wounds during the Civil War was amputation. Most casualties during the war were caused by musket fire. The large caliber lead balls often shattered bones upon impact. Unable to splint or repair bones so damaged, physicians frequently chose to amputate the wounded person’s limb above the injury. Doctors typically sewed a flap of skin over the stump. Unfortunately, due to the high incidents of infection for reasons described above, amputated limbs often became infected. Gangrene was among the most dangerous conditions, which could lead to death. The only method of combatting gangrene was to perform another amputation further up the limb (if possible) and hope it healed properly. Confederate and Union physicians performed around 50,000 amputations during the Civil War. Contrary to some popular myths, anesthesia, such as chloroform and ether, was in use during the Civil War, and around 95% of wounded soldiers were afforded some comfort before amputation.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD25003265P4'>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned home from the Civil War with scars or permanent disabilities from wartime wounds and injuries. The large number of amputees also led to new developments in prosthetics. Lessons learned from the war improved medical care a bit, as Union and Confederate doctors recorded their observations of wounds and treatments. Published reports provided a new wealth of information. However, only after scientists better understood microbes and accepted the Germ Theory in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did medical practice substantially improve from the Civil War era practices.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 41–50; Terry Reimer, “Wounds, Ammunition, and Amputation,” National Museum of Civil War Medicine; Paige Gibbons Backus, “Amputation and the Civil War,” American Battlefield Trust)

<p corresp='TTP33130353P1' xml:id='OTP33130353P1'>TO HIS EXCELLENCY, GOV. <rs ref='#S52648'>AMES</rs>, OF MISSISSIPPI:
</p>

<p corresp='TTP33130353P2' xml:id='OTP33130353P2'>The undersigned, citizens of Washington County, approach your Excellency in behalf of <b><rs ref='#S32023250'>HENRY BARRETT</rs></b>, (<rs ref='#S57096'>colored</rs>) <rs ref='#S71046'>convicted</rs> in the <rs ref='#S70054'>Circuit Court</rs> of this county for <rs ref='#S63108'>robbery</rs>, and now under <rs ref='#S32021053'>sentence</rs> of twelve months' <rs ref='#S69535'>imprisonment</rs> in the <rs ref='#S54861'>Penitentiary</rs>.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP33130353P3' xml:id='OTP33130353P3'>The following are the circumstances of the case, as developed by the evidence on the <rs ref='#S32121282'>trial</rs>:
</p>

<p corresp='TTP33130353P4' xml:id='OTP33130353P4'>One <rs ref='#S32023251'>James Cooper</rs> (another colored man) <rs ref='#S32084844'>owed</rs> Henry Barrett, the defendant, $7, and promised to give Barrett some seed cotton he had in payment of the debt, which Barrett accepted. Afterwards, before Barrett got possession, Cooper carried the cotton to <rs ref='#S62919'>Greenville</rs> and sold it, and with the proceeds bought the articles alleged to have been robbed. Barrett was aware that Cooper had sold the cotton, and over-taking him as he (Cooper) was leaving <del rend='overstrike'>from</del> Greenville, demanded his debt. Cooper said he had no money; whereupon Barrett said he would "whip it out of him," and immediately commenced an <rs ref='#S63919'>assault and battery</rs> on Cooper, in which he knocked and <rs ref='#S25003265'>bruised</rs> Cooper considerably, and then seized a jug of whisky and one pair of shoes belonging to Cooper, mounted his horse, and rode away rapidly. This occurred just in front of the Court House. The whisky and shoes were shown to be valued at $4.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP33130353P5' xml:id='OTP33130353P5'>Immediately after this occurrence, Barrett was <rs ref='#S62954'>arrested</rs> and brought before Esq. <rs ref='#S25026329'>Elliott</rs>, a <rs ref='#S63172'>Justice of the Peace</rs>, on the <rs ref='#S32074731'>charge</rs> of assault and battery on Cooper, and for that offence he was tried and convicted by the magistrate, and fined $25 and costs, and was directed by the magistrate to restore to Cooper his whisky and shoes, which he accordingly did, and paid his fine and costs.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP33130353P6' xml:id='OTP33130353P6'>The <rs ref='#S63178'>Grand Jury</rs> afterwards <rs ref='#S95194'>indicted</rs> him for the same offence, making it the graver charge of robbery. He offered in Court the <rs ref='#S32024050'>plea</rs> of his former conviction and sen-tence, which the Court would not allow, on the ground that the offence for which he had been convicted was only a misdemeanor, and the indictment was for a felony.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP33130353P7' xml:id='OTP33130353P7'>The jury, feeling bound to find the defendant guilty, nevertheless recommended him to the mercy of the Court.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP33130353P8' xml:id='OTP33130353P8'>The undersigned, believing that Barrett's is a case calling peculiarly for the exercise of <rs ref='#S62927'>Executive clemency</rs>, respectfully ask your Excellency to <b><rs ref='#S62927'>PARDON</rs></b> the said Henry Barrett.<lb/>
