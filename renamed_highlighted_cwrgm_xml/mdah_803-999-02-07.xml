                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32091791P0'>Philip Henry Sheridan was a career U.S. Army officer who served as a general during the Civil War and Reconstruction.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P1'>Born on March 6, 1831 in Albany, New York, Sheridan graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1853. He was nicknamed “Little Phil” for his small stature, measuring just five feet, five inches tall. Sheridan was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant and was sent to Eagle Pass, Texas. However, most of his early military service was in the Pacific Northwest, where he was involved in conflicts with Native American tribes. In March 1861, he was promoted to first lieutenant and then to captain in May following the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P2'>During the Civil War, Sheridan was initially assigned to the 13th U.S. Infantry. In route, however, he was reassigned as a staff officer. He became the chief commissary officer of the Army of Southwest Missouri and was also a quartermaster general. He served under Major General Samuel Curtis from January 1862 to April or May 1862, at which point he served as a topographical engineer and was ultimately appointed to the rank of colonel in the 2nd Michigan Cavalry.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P3'>As a combat leader, Sheridan proved effective at the Battle of Booneville, Mississippi on July 1, 1862. He was rewarded a promotion to the rank of brigadier general and was assigned to command the 11th Division, III Corps in the Army of the Ohio. Then, as a reward for his leadership at the Battles of Perryville and Stones River, he was promoted to the rank of major general. Officially, he was promoted on April 10, 1863 (with a date of rank December 31, 1862).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P4'>As a major general, Sheridan led his division during the Battles of Chickamauga and Chattanooga. Sheridan’s aggressive advance at Chattanooga (November 25, 1863) led the U.S. victory in the battle. As the newly promoted general-in-chief of the U.S. Army, Grant transferred Sheridan to the Army of the Potomac in the Eastern Theater, naming him commander of the Cavalry Corps. Sheridan reached headquarters on April 5, 1864 and assumed command.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P5'>As the Cavalry Corps commander, Sheridan took part in Grant’s Overland Campaign (May through June 1864) against Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Rather than embrace a more traditional cavalry role of screening, reconnaissance, and rear guard, Sheridan launched a more aggressive attack against the Confederate cavalry around Richmond. One of Sheridan’s raids was responsible for mortally wounding Confederate cavalry commander Major General J. E. B. Stuart on May 11, 1864, but more broadly he left Grant without the cavalry intelligence that could have aided him in his battles against Lee.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P6'>By the end of May, Sheridan’s cavalry had rejoined the Army of the Potomac. At the Battle of Trevillian Station (June 11-12), he took part in the largest and bloodiest all-cavalry battle of the war against Confederate cavalry under Major Generals Wade Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee. Sheridan’s objective was to destroy stretches of the Virginia Central Railroad and link up with the U.S. Army in the Shenandoah Valley. Tactically, Sheridan failed to achieve his goals, although it was a distraction that assisted in Grant’s advance.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P7'>On August 7, 1864, Grant organized the Middle Military Division whose field troops were known as the Army of the Shenandoah, and he appointed Sheridan as its commander. Sheridan’s objective was two-fold. First, he was to defeat Confederate General Lieutenant General Jubal Early who was advancing near Washington and was threatening parts of Pennsylvania. Secondly, he was to destroy the Shenandoah Valley as a potential agricultural resource for the Confederate Army. Sheridan successfully attacked Early’s forces on September 19 and followed up with a victory at Fisher’s Hill near Strasburg, Virginia on September 22. Afterwards, his cavalry relentlessly destroyed livestock, provisions, barns, mills, factories, and railroads throughout the area, rendering over 400 square miles of land uninhabitable. Residents called this “The Burning.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P8'>For his success in the Shenandoah Valley, Sheridan was promoted to the rank of major general on November 8, 1864. This made him the fourth ranking general in the U.S. Army, following only Grant, Sherman, and Meade. In March 1865, Sheridan moved his men to Petersburg to rejoin the Army of the Potomac. He led a relentless campaign against Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s Army, managing some of the most crucial aspects of the Appomattox Campaign and helping force Lee’s surrender on April 9.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P9'>After the war, Sheridan was tasked with Reconstruction efforts in the west, starting with Texas. In March 1867, he was appointed military governor of the Fifth Military District. He implemented strict voting limitations against former Confederates and protected the Black vote. Sheridan also investigated the deadly New Orleans riot of 1866, within which thirty-four Black people were killed, and he dismissed the mayor of New Orleans, the Louisiana attorney general, a district judge, and Louisiana Governor James M. Wells. Sheridan also forced New Orleans to desegregate street cars. For what he deemed tyrannical leadership, U.S. President Andrew Johnson removed Sheridan from the post, but Sheridan continued to serve as Grant’s western arm, including commanding troops in New Orleans in the aftermath of the disputed 1876 presidential election.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P10'>Following his position in the Fifth Military District, Sheridan was assigned to the Department of the Missouri. In the west, Sheridan came into conflict with Native American tribes, echoing the earliest stages of his military career. In 1869, he was made senior commander of the Military Division of the Missouri. As commander, Sheridan made the protection of the Yellowstone area one of his personal crusades. He used the military to control the area and protect its natural resources and its wildlife from destruction, and he was a successful opponent to the government’s initial plans to sell land to developers. The military operated Yellowstone Park until the National Park Service took it over in 1916.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P11'>In January 1875, Sheridan assumed command of the Department of the Gulf, and on November 1, 1883, he became the Commanding General of the entire U.S. Army, and he held this position until his death. On June 1, 1888, he was promoted the rank of General, which is equivalent to today’s five-star general.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32091791P12'>Sheridan was officially married only once, but his first romantic engagement was with a Takelma woman named Elizabeth Francis “Betsy” Dye, with whom he had one daughter. In 1875, he married Irene (Rucker) Sheridan, with whom he had four children, including three daughters and one son who lived to adulthood. Philip Henry Sheridan (Sr.) died on August 5, 1888 in Dartmouth, Bristol County, Massachusetts. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51665P0'>Marmaduke Shannon was a newspaper editor and sheriff in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51665P1'>Born on January 24, 1805, in Pennsylvania, Shannon moved to Ohio as a child with his family and then relocated to Mississippi at the age of 21. Briefly living in Natchez, and New Orleans, Louisiana, Shannon moved to Vicksburg in 1829 and remained there the rest of his life. In 1830 he became part owner of a local newspaper, and seven years later became editor and owner of a newspaper called the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>. He renamed it the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg Whig</hi> to reflect his political views. Shannon reportedly led an effort in the 1830s to evict certain people of disrepute from Vicksburg. The campaign resulted in the hanging of men accused of being gamblers and the eviction of women accused of being prostitutes. Shannon was arrested for his involvement in the incident, but was supported by numerous local attorneys who assisted in his defense.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS51665P2'>As a leading Whig in Mississippi, Shannon was a Unionist during the secession crisis, but remained in Mississippi after it declared its separation from the Union and continued to run his newspaper. The publication remained in operation until 1863, when its building was destroyed during the siege of Vicksburg in the Civil War. In 1865, Shannon was appointed sheriff of Warren County. He retired from public life a short time later. He died on October 17, 1888. Shannon was married to Levina Morris and had at least twelve children. He is buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P0'>This subject tag includes references to various and unidentified state and local elections held within Mississippi. During the Civil War, most Mississippians supported secession and the Confederacy and therefore voted in favor of policies and for candidates dedicated to those causes. After the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, President Andrew Johnson instituted a lenient Reconstruction policy that offered amnesty to individuals who took an oath of loyalty to the United States (with exceptions for certain upper-class southerners). This policy allowed many former Confederates to run for office shortly after the end of the war and pass legislation designed to limit the rights of freed African Americans, known as the Black Codes. Restrictions against black political rights led Republicans in the U.S. Congress to take a firmer hand in Mississippi’s Reconstruction and protect Black rights. Between 1867 and 1876, Republicans backed by federal soldiers struggled to ensure Black Mississippians had equal voting rights and could run for office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P1'>Many white southern conservatives, however, used threats and violence to prevent Black Mississippians and white Republicans from voting, or influence the results of elections. These efforts reached a peak in 1874 under the “Mississippi Plan,” which began with a systematic effort to disenfranchise Black voters in Mississippi and evict African American and Republican office holders. As many as three hundred Black people were killed in Vicksburg in the racial violence. President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to Vicksburg to enforce the law, but soldiers were unable to change the political climate within the state. White Democrats organized under the Mississippi Plan suppressed Black and Republican voters enough to dominate state elections in 1875 by 30,000 votes. Reconstruction ended in 1877 with white conservatives still in command of Mississippi’s state and local politics.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32097921P0'>The election of 1875 was fraught with racial violence. The Democratic Party, which was overwhelmingly comprised of white Mississippians, carried out what was called the "white line" campaign, in which white Mississippians inflicted violence against Black Americans who attempted to exercise their right to vote. White mob violence largely prevented Black Americans and other Republicans from participating in the election of 1875, which allowed for a widespread victory for Democrats in Mississippi that year.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63099P0'>While Cambridge Dictionary defines an enslaved person as "a person who is legally owned by someone else and has no personal freedom" (Cambridge Dictionary), CWRGM adopts the term for the people who were subjected to the practice of race-based enslavement in the nineteenth-century United States chattel slavery system. Slavery in the United States varied greatly over time and geography. However, its most common form was that of race-based chattel slavery in which people of African descent were viewed and treated as property.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P1'>Methods of work also varied based on region, but those enslaved in Deep South states like Mississippi typically worked under the gang labor system in which, under the supervision of overseers, "gangs of slaves worked their ways through fields, plowing, thinning, hoeing, chopping, picking, or whatever else the day's assignment might be" (Mississippi Encyclopedia). The U.S.'s slave labor system subjected the enslaved to extreme violence, physical, psychological, and often sexual, and brutal working conditions and decreased individual autonomy.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P2'>Both state and federal legal systems also rendered escape or freedom nearly impossible in the South. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act at the national level required all people, even northerners, to return runaway slaves, rendering an escape to freedom extremely difficult. Mississippi's slave codes specifically implemented slave patrols, pass systems, corporal punishment, supervision of all religious gatherings, and the requirement that an African American person have proof of freedom at all times to curtail the already few rights of enslaved and free African Americans. Mississippi's status as a hub of the domestic slave trade, the individual autonomy whites possessed to punish the enslaved, and frequent abuse of the law by slave patrols increased the likelihood that even a free Black person could be captured and sold into slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63099P3'>Despite this adversity, the enslaved in Mississippi and elsewhere resisted and exercised agency in multiple ways. Some enslaved persons directly resisted by running away or violently rebelling, while others chose indirect methods like breaking tools, intentionally working slowly, or feigning illness or injury. The enslaved also maintained their agency and autonomy by crafting networks of kinship and family both within and across plantations, cultivating gardens for their own use, performing gender roles of their own choosing, and holding social and religious gatherings infused with unique cultural and social elements (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63948P0'>The term "enslavers"  includes any person (male and female) who enslaved one or more of the more than 12.5 million people sold into the United States' race-based system of human chattel slavery between the 16th and 19th centuries. Enslavers used terms like "master," "owner," or "slaveholder" to imply a natural hierarchy within slavery and/or to imply that certain members of society were more capable than others. CWRGM, along with many other historical and archival resources, instead adopts the term "enslaver" to underscore the active effort on the part of enslavers to create and perpetuate a system of bondage over equally capable human beings deserving of the same natural rights (National Park Service).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD71308P0'><b>Native American History:</b> The Cambridge Dictionary defines a Native American person as "a member of one of the groups of people who were living in North and South America before Europeans arrived." (Cambridge Dictionary) Native Americans have a long and complicated history with the United States. Since the founding of the U.S., Native American tribes, incredibly diverse in language, government, religion, and culture, were barred from U.S. citizenship and treated as independent nations with whom the U.S. was required to act only through mutually agreed upon treaties and diplomatic measures. However, in practice, United States frequently employed deceit and violence to accomplish its aims with Native Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P1'>While Native Americans had lived on North American soil throughout the continent and in every part of what would become the U.S. since long before European settlers arrived, Native American-U.S. relations in the nineteenth century became the story of how the U.S. sought to remove Native Americans from that ancestral land and to colonize it for its own purposes. The largest, though certainly not the only, of these efforts came with the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which in seeking to open the rich soil of southeastern states like Mississippi to enslaved labor required Native Americans living there to relocate to reservations west of the Mississippi River. Indian Removal was a brutal process including extensive forced marches in terrible conditions.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P2'>While Native Americans fought on both sides of the American Civil War, the U.S. Army continued to violently force Native Americans further even from their reservation lands throughout the nineteenth century in a series of conflicts known generally as the "Indian Wars." Despite facing enormous legal, political, and military adversity as well as racism from the American populace, Native Americans often remained both in their original homelands as well as in reservations, working continually to right the historical wrongs committed by the federal government, establishing more equitable relationships to the U.S., and remaining an integral part of American history and life into the twenty-first century. (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P3'><b>Native American Naming Conventions:</b> Native Americans, also referred to as Indigenous people or American Indians, are the original inhabitants of North America. When Columbus sailed from Portugal, he intended to reach the Dutch East Indies, or what is today Singapore. Instead, he landed in the Caribbean and labeled the inhabitants “Los Indios.” (James A. Campbell, “Columbus and <hi rend='italic'>Los Indios</hi> as ‘God’s People’,” <hi rend='italic'>Los Angeles Times</hi>) Thus, the name became anglicized and “Indian” became common usage by Europeans after they arrived in North America. The term “American Indian” is used by the United States Federal Government and by the U.S. Census Bureau. The term Native American and Indigenous are more recent terminology that developed in the latter half of the 20th century, but not all Indigenous people in the U.S. agree to a single unified term.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P4'><b>Legal Terminology:</b> Native Americans are incorporated into the U.S. legal system, as they are the only ethnic group explicitly mentioned in the <hi rend='italic'>U.S. Constitution</hi>. The commerce clause restricts individual states from dealing with “Indian Tribes.” (<hi rend='italic'>U.S. Constitution</hi>, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3) Instead, only the federal government can ratify treaties made with American Indians. While treaties are legally binding documents that outline how two governments should honor each other’s promises, they were ratified into law but rarely honored due to corruption or general ill-will. The case <hi rend='italic'>Cherokee v. Georgia</hi> in the 1830s ruled that American Indians are “Domestic Dependent Nations,”  therefore, they have the ability to govern themselves (sovereignty), but with curtailed authority. As a result, Native American sovereignty is frequently determined and redetermined by social events, court decisions, and politicians.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P5'>In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act also known as the Howard-Wheeler Act, giving tribes the ability to adopt constitutions by democratic vote. Some tribes adopted constitutions, while others rejected it. Each tribal community or nation has to be recognized by the U.S. Federal Government to receive services through the Bureau of Indian Affairs or to benefit from certain rights afforded to American Indians.

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P6'><b>Native American’s Today:</b> The question of who is considered Native American is a controversial topic, as each tribal community has the sovereignty to determine their own membership. Some use lineal descent, residency, or Blood Quantum—or the calculation of full-blooded “Indian” ancestors in an individual’s lineage to determine a fraction like 1/4)—to determine enrollment in a federally recognized tribe. Today, Native Americans continue to work to achieve and protect sovereignty and the ability to direct their future for their communities. In the 1960s and 1970s, American Indians achieved self-determination—or the ability for tribes to govern themselves with minimal federal oversight—especially regarding treaty rights.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD71308P7'>CWRGM recognizes the immense diversity of Native American tribes and their unique experiences and therefore uses the "Native Americans" tag to make those experiences more discoverable only in the absence of references to specific tribal names within its documents.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
