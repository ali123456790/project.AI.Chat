                    <p xml:id='OTPS52648P0'>Adelbert Ames served as a governor and U.S. senator of Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.  He was born in East Thomaston (modern-day Rockland), Maine, in 1835. As a boy, Ames spent time working on various merchant vessels, receiving training in seamanship. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856, graduating in May 1861, at the start of the Civil War. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, the young Ames was promoted to first lieutenant barely over a week later and served with the 5th U.S. Artillery during the battle of First Bull Run at Manassas, Virginia, on July 21, 1861. Despite being wounded in the leg, Ames stayed by his cannons. His actions at Bull Run led him to receive the brevet (honorary) rank of major and, in 1893 (more than thirty years later), the Medal of Honor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P1'>Ames recovered from his wound and returned to the front lines in 1862, serving with distinction as an artillery officer during the Peninsula Campaign near Richmond. Seeking better promotion potential, Ames sought an infantry command. Through those efforts, in August 1862, he received command of the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment, and led that unit in combat during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. In May 1863, he volunteered to serve as a staff officer for Major General George G. Meade, which helped him achieve the rank of brigadier general that month. With this promotion, Ames left the 20th Maine to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who gained great fame commanding the regiment at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Ames’ own performance at Gettysburg was highly praised, as his division successfully defended the Union position at Cemetery Hill.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P2'>After Gettysburg, Ames’ division was transferred to the Department of the South. Over the next two years, he commanded Union troops during campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in March 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P3'>After the Civil War, Ames became involved in federal Reconstruction efforts. In 1868, he was appointed the provisional governor of Mississippi. Ames proved sympathetic to the plight of African Americans in the south. He sought to protect Black civil rights and appointed Mississippi’s first African American public officials. In 1870, after Mississippi was readmitted into the Union, Ames ran for U.S. senator for the state as a Republican and won. He served in that capacity from February 1870 to January 1874, achieving the reputation as a strong public speaker. While serving as a senator in Washington, D.C., Ames met and married Blanche Butler, daughter of Union general Benjamin F. Butler, under whom Ames had served during the war. Ames and his wife had six children over the course of their marriage.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P4'>In 1873, Ames ran for governor of Mississippi. His chief rival was James L. Alcorn, a former Confederate general who had been a Whig before the Civil War and joined the Republican Party afterwards. Ames won the election and worked diligently to improve Mississippi’s financial and social situation. In 1874, Democrats in Mississippi coordinated a campaign of violence against African Americans and white Republicans in the state, to secure political control in Mississippi. Unable to militarily suppress the white supremacist terror campaign, Ames signed a truce with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to reduce the violence and allow a peaceful election. Groups of white supremacists abandoned the truce and resumed their intimidation tactics against Republicans and Black Mississippians during the following elections, leading to a surge of Democratic politicians taking office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P5'>In 1876, the conservative Democrat majority in the Mississippi legislature tried to impeach Ames and many other Republican officials with trumped up charges of corruption. Despite a strong political force against him, Ames’ critics were unable to provide any evidence of impropriety. Nevertheless, because impeachment was politically driven, Ames could see that his future as governor was over and any effort on his part to legally defend himself would be personally and financially taxing. He and his attorneys reached an agreement with Democratic leaders to resign his office in exchange for dropping the legal charges. On March 29, 1876, after Democrats cancelled their legal proceedings, Ames vacated his position.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P6'>Ames left Mississippi and went into business in Minnesota with his father and brother. A short time later, he relocated to New York City and then Massachusetts, overseeing mills and various business interests. When the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, Ames volunteered for service and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. Although over sixty years old, Ames joined the field campaign in Cuba and performed well.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS52648P7'>Ames resumed his business ventures in the early twentieth century. He lived until 1933, dying at age 97. He is buried in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS101965P0'>William Feimster Tucker was a Confederate general during the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P1'>Born on May 9, 1827, in Iredell County, North Carolina, Tucker graduated from Emory and Henry College in Virginia in 1848. He moved to Houston, Mississippi, and studied law, soon securing a seat as probate judge in Chickasaw County.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P2'>Tucker volunteered for Confederate military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He was commissioned as a captain in the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment and saw action at the First Battle of Bull Run. Tucker was later transferred to the western theater, and placed in command of the Forty-first Mississippi Infantry Regiment, where he participated in several battles in Kentucky and Tennessee in 1862 and 1863. In March 1864, he was promoted to brigadier general and commanded Confederate troops against Union forces under William Tecumseh Sherman during the Atlanta Campaign. Tucker was severely wounded at the Battle of Resaca in May 1864 and was forced to retire from field duty. He recovered enough to hold take command of the District of Southern Mississippi and East Louisiana during the final weeks of the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P3'>After the Civil War, Tucker returned to Mississippi to practice law. He ran for state political office at the end of Reconstruction, winning two terms in the state’s House of Representatives in the late 1870s. He was murdered on September 14, 1881, in Okolona, Mississippi, when an unknown assailant fired a gun through Tucker’s bedroom window, killing him instantly. The death was suspected to be an assassination, possibly stemming from one of Tucker’s legal cases. Several people were questioned, and two men arrested, but no one was convicted of the murder.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS101965P4'>Tucker was married to Martha Josephine Chackelford. The couple had at least six children that lived to adulthood. Tucker is buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Okolona, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32099145P0'>A bar association is a professional association of attorneys, often responsible for regulating the legal practices and standards in their communities. The use of the word “bar” is tied to the traditional presence of a railing in court room to separate court proceeding from the public viewing area. In the United States, bar association requirements vary. Most are now organized as corporations. Many states require lawyers to be members of a respective bar association to practice law. Attorneys typically must pass bar exams to demonstrate proficiency in their state’s laws, regulations, and legal practices for admission to a bar association. (Wikipedia)

They hold jury trials, but circuit court justices can preside without a jury if the matter at hand involves questions of law rather than fact. In nineteenth century America, circuit courts judges often traveled throughout their jurisdictional area to hold court in various local areas—an activity contributing to the phrase “traveled the circuit.” The practice was more common in sparsely populated and frontier areas. Once communities became more established, circuit courts maintained permanent locations. (State of Mississippi Judiciary)

They feel it unnecessary to say anything concerning his at-tainments and other qualifications, he being so ex-tensively and favorably known throughout the District, and indeed the State. They feel that his appoint-ment will come nearer giving universal satisfac-tion than any that can be made. They further be-leive that, in the discharge of the duties of such office, he will wield an influence that will redound to the lasting benefit of the people and the <hi rend='underline'>future of our freed State</hi>. So feeling and beleiving, they again, with earnestness, urge the favorable con-sideration of their application
