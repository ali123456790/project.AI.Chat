                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P1'>Born on October 28, 1838, Falconer grew up in Holly Springs, Mississippi. As a young man he worked at the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Herald</hi> (his father’s newspaper) and attended the University of Mississippi, graduating in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. When the war broke out, Falconer enlisted in the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Recognized for his intelligence and writing ability, Falconer was soon promoted and moved to administrative and staff work, first serving as the private secretary and then adjutant general for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Later he served as a staff officer for Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864.

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P2'>After the defeat of the Confederacy, Falconer returned to Mississippi and reentered the newspaper business, becoming editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Holly Springs Reporter</hi>. He began fostering an interest state politics and unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor as a Democrat under Benjamin G. Humphreys in 1868. In 1870, Falconer stepped away from editorial duties at the <hi rend='italic'>Reporter</hi> to practice law full time. He continued participating in Democratic politics and in 1877 was elected secretary of state. He entered that office in January 1878. However, only a few months later, a yellow fever epidemic struck parts of Mississippi. Falconer’s brother and father were stricken by the mosquito-borne disease. He went to Holly Springs to aid in their care, but both men died. Falconer himself then came down with the disease and died on September 23, 1878. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
