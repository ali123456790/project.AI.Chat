                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32078490P0'>William Pitt Kellogg was governor of Louisiana and a U.S. Senator during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P1'>Born on December 8, 1830, in Orwell, Vermont, Kellogg moved to Illinois as a young man and taught school. In the 1850s he moved to Illinois and became an attorney, meeting fellow lawyer Abraham Lincoln. When Lincoln entered the U.S. presidency in 1861, Kellogg received an appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Nebraska Territory. He only briefly held that position before volunteering for military service and served as an officer in the Seventh Illinois Cavalry Regiment. By 1862, he had received a promotion to colonel, but resigned that summer due to health problems and returned to Nebraska to resume his duties in the territorial Supreme Court.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P2'>In 1865, Kellogg received an appointment as the federal customs collector in New Orleans, Louisiana. He held that position until 1868, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate for Louisiana, upon that state’s readmission to the Union. In 1872, Kellogg ran for governor of Louisiana as a Republican. Upon winning a disputed election, he resigned his Senate seat. Democrats, and even some Republicans, challenged Kellogg’s legitimacy in office, however he remained governor largely through the support of President Ulysses S. Grant. The Louisiana legislature impeached Kellogg in 1876, but the state Senate did not convict him.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P3'>In 1876, Kellogg again ran for the U.S. Senate. He won, despite severe opposition by conservative white Democrats. He served until 1883, but did not run for reelection due to the collapse of the Republican Party in Louisiana and the resurgence of Democratic control. However, Kellogg managed to secure enough support to win a U.S. House of Representatives seat during the 1882 election and served in that role from 1883 to 1885.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P4'>After his Congressional career, Kellogg retired in Washington, D.C. He died on August 10, 1918. He was married to Mary Ellen Wills. Kellogg is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.
