                    <p xml:id='OTPS68894P0'>John William Robinson was a prominent businessman in Mississippi during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS68894P1'>Born in South Oxford, New York, on March 12, 1823, Robinson moved to Mississippi around 1848. He worked as a clerk for the mercantile company of Fearn &amp; Richardson and eventually entered into his own partnership with Colonel Edward Richardson to form Richardson &amp; Robinson, a clothing and mercantile business. Robinson expanded his business ventures into other Mississippi towns, helping to form Robinson, Reynolds &amp; Company in Brandon, and Robinson, Mayson &amp; Company in Canton. Robinson was among the most successful and notable businessmen in Mississippi when he died on April 27, 1881, from pneumonia. He was married to Mary Jane Bradford and had at least four children who lived to adulthood. Robinson is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32099655P0'>During the nineteenth century, Mississippi operated a sporadic hospital system, which was primarily focused on creating state institutions to provide mental health care for people imprisoned in the state's penitentiary in Jackson and the Mississippi State Hospital, which operated in Jackson from 1855 to 1926 when it was moved to Rankin County. Otherwise medical and mental health care was typically handled locally, especially for enslaved people on plantations.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD105689P0'>Founded in 1848, the Mississippi State Hospital was a state-funded institution in Jackson, Mississippi, for people suffering from psychological disorders. First proposed by Governor Albert Gallatin Brown in 1846, the initial facility was constructed on a five-acre lot with funds provided by the state legislature. Shortly afterwards, the hospital’s commissioners constructed a larger facility north of Jackson (currently the campus of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson) with guidance and support from noted humanitarian Dorothea L. Dix, who personally appealed to Mississippi legislators for better mental health treatment. (Before the nineteenth century, people with psychiatric problems were often ignored, abandoned, or jailed as public nuisances.) Named the Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum, the four-story hospital began taking patients in 1855. Originally intended for white patients, the hospital’s administrators and board of trustees began admitting a small number of African Americans—free and slave—for treatment in 1856.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P1'>The state hospital housed and treated thousands of mental health patients (often referred to as lunatics in the vernacular of the nineteenth century). The number of patients rose from 70 in 1855 to nearly 500 by 1890. Most people admitted for treatment in the 1850s were women in their 20’s and 30’s, sent by family members for causes listed as “unlucky in business,” “disappointed in love,” and “feeblemindedness.” Patients were also placed into the state hospital for behavior associated to menstruation, overactive sexual interests or activities, drug or alcohol use, and other behaviors deemed socially or religiously inappropriate. Not all patients were admitted at the behest of family members, as local citizens could file complaints against neighbors or other residents, prompting their local sheriff to detain the suspected “lunatic” and present them to a county probate court for a jury to decide if admission to the asylum was necessary.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P2'>The facility and its care for psychological disorders were considered advanced for the mid-nineteenth century and many patients were employed in jobs, such as carpentry, farming, manufacturing, and other laboring tasks on the hospital grounds. However, some treatments for psychological disorders in that era included mechanical restraints, physical punishment, and isolation. As many as 7,000 patients died at the state hospital site at Jackson between 1855 and its 1935, when the Mississippi government closed the state hospital at Jackson and opened a new facility at a different location. Some deaths were due to poorly understood sanitation or disease problems, such as tainted water supplies, as well as yellow fever and malaria epidemics, but many other deaths occurred due to the patients remaining at the facility until they died of natural causes. The hospital was seen as a permanent residence for those deemed “incurable.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P3'>During the Civil War, Union soldiers temporarily occupied the state hospital when they captured Jackson. The troops confiscated property from the facility, including killing livestock held on the hospital grounds. However, the hospital remained active during the war, and was improved in 1870 with the appointment of Dr. William Compton as superintendent. He lobbied for better funds and treatment for patients, particularly for African Americans, although the facility was segregated by race and gender.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD105689P4'>The state hospital continued to expand and treat a growing number of patients well into the twentieth century. By the mid-1920s it housed 2,000 patients. Due to its deteriorating conditions after decades of operation, the Mississippi legislature constructed a new facility in Rankin County, which opened in 1935. The Mississippi State Hospital at Jackson closed its doors that same year. (Lucius M. Lampton, “Whitfield (Mississippi State Hospital),” Mississippi Encyclopedia; Sudhakar Madakasira, “History of Mississippi Psychiatry: A Dark Past Unearthed on UMMC Grounds,” <hi rend='italic'>The Journal of the Mississippi Psychiatric Association</hi>)
