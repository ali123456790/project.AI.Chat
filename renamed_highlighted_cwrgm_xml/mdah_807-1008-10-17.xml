<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P1'>Born on October 28, 1838, Falconer grew up in Holly Springs, Mississippi. As a young man he worked at the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Herald</hi> (his father’s newspaper) and attended the University of Mississippi, graduating in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. When the war broke out, Falconer enlisted in the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Recognized for his intelligence and writing ability, Falconer was soon promoted and moved to administrative and staff work, first serving as the private secretary and then adjutant general for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Later he served as a staff officer for Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864.

He continued participating in Democratic politics and in 1877 was elected secretary of state. He entered that office in January 1878. However, only a few months later, a yellow fever epidemic struck parts of Mississippi. Falconer’s brother and father were stricken by the mosquito-borne disease. He went to Holly Springs to aid in their care, but both men died. Falconer himself then came down with the disease and died on September 23, 1878. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32131312P0'>Martin Marshall was a lawyer and Mississippi state politician in Vicksburg, Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32131312P1'>Born on June 27, 1846 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Marshall was attending the Virginia Military Institute when the Civil War began in 1861. He enlisted in the Confederate Army and was wounded in the Battle of New Market in 1861, rendering him unable to serve. However, he did complete his studies at the Military Institute after the war.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32131312P2'>By 1869, Marshall opened a law firm called T. A. and M. Marshall with his father Thomas Alexander Marshall, and by 1876, due to his father's declining health, he was partnered with T. M. Miller. In 1876, Marshall became a Mississippi state repesentative, representing Warren County. Marshall resumed practicing law after serving one term. In 1884, he was elected as a state Senator, serving one term before resuming his law practice again. In 1885, he was also appointed captain in the Vicksburg Rifles militia company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32131312P3'>Marshall was married to Mary Ellen "Ella" (Bush) Marshall. The pair had five children, including three sons and two daughters. Martin Marshall died on September 17, 1895 in Vicksburg. He was buried in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32078490P0'>William Pitt Kellogg was governor of Louisiana and a U.S. Senator during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P1'>Born on December 8, 1830, in Orwell, Vermont, Kellogg moved to Illinois as a young man and taught school. In the 1850s he moved to Illinois and became an attorney, meeting fellow lawyer Abraham Lincoln. When Lincoln entered the U.S. presidency in 1861, Kellogg received an appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Nebraska Territory. He only briefly held that position before volunteering for military service and served as an officer in the Seventh Illinois Cavalry Regiment. By 1862, he had received a promotion to colonel, but resigned that summer due to health problems and returned to Nebraska to resume his duties in the territorial Supreme Court.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P2'>In 1865, Kellogg received an appointment as the federal customs collector in New Orleans, Louisiana. He held that position until 1868, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate for Louisiana, upon that state’s readmission to the Union. In 1872, Kellogg ran for governor of Louisiana as a Republican. Upon winning a disputed election, he resigned his Senate seat. Democrats, and even some Republicans, challenged Kellogg’s legitimacy in office, however he remained governor largely through the support of President Ulysses S. Grant. The Louisiana legislature impeached Kellogg in 1876, but the state Senate did not convict him.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P3'>In 1876, Kellogg again ran for the U.S. Senate. He won, despite severe opposition by conservative white Democrats. He served until 1883, but did not run for reelection due to the collapse of the Republican Party in Louisiana and the resurgence of Democratic control. However, Kellogg managed to secure enough support to win a U.S. House of Representatives seat during the 1882 election and served in that role from 1883 to 1885.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32078490P4'>After his Congressional career, Kellogg retired in Washington, D.C. He died on August 10, 1918. He was married to Mary Ellen Wills. Kellogg is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32141859P0'>The Supreme Court of Mississippi is the highest court within the state of Mississippi. Established by the original constitution of Mississippi in 1817, the court first met in January 1818. Justices were originally elected by the Mississippi legislature and met twice a year in Natchez. The rest of the year they presided over state superior courts. When Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1832, the court was renamed the High Court of Errors and Appeals and was made of three judges who were publicly elected for six-year terms. An 1836 amendment to the state constitution moved the high court to Jackson.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32141859P1'>The court was disrupted by the Civil War and Reconstruction. Although the court convened in 1866, federal authorities ignored its decision in Ex parte Lewis which declared the Civil Rights Act of 1866 unconstitutional. The justices resigned in protest, prompting federal officials to appoint replacements.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32141859P2'>In 1868, Mississippi drafted a new constitution which again revised the state’s highest court. Called the Supreme Court of Mississippi, the court was made of justices appointed by the governor with consent of the Mississippi senate. The constitution of 1890 made some additional changes to the Supreme Court, and in 1898 the Mississippi legislature again tried to make the justices’ positions subject to public election. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that act on technical grounds, but Mississippians amended their constitution in 1914 to provide for public election of justices for eight years. Since then the Supreme Court has been subjected to some additional adjustments by the Mississippi legislature, but continues to preside as the highest court in the state. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.
