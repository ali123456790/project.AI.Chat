                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32141275P0'>William Read Miller was a long serving public official and governor of Arkansas during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32141275P1'>Born on November 23, 1823, near Batesville, Arkansas Territory, Miller grew up as a farmer but pursued an interest in law and politics a young man. He won election as a county clerk in 1848 and was appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of state auditor by the Arkansas governor in 1854. Although he lost election to the position in 1855, Miller impressed many officials with his accounting report of the Real Estate Bank of Arkansas and won his place as the state auditor in 1857. He remained in that position through the Civil War.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32141275P2'>Reconstruction interrupted Miller’s seat as auditor. He completed his legal studies during that period, and became a practicing attorney in 1868. Near the end of Reconstruction, Miller returned to the office of state auditor, serving from 1874 to 1876. His popularity rose, leading him to win election as governor of Arkansas in 1876—being the first Arkansas-born individual to hold the office. He served two consecutive two-year terms. Miller proved to be supportive of black civil rights, earning opposition from white conservatives in the state.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32141275P3'>After leaving the governor’s office, Miller became involved in railroad companies and made a decent amount of money from his business investments. He occasionally held public office in the 1880s, including deputy state treasurer from 1881 to 1882, and then as state auditor in 1886. Miller died on November 29, 1887. He was married to Susan Bevens and had at least four children. He is buried in Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32100941P0'>Kinloch Falconer was active in Democratic politics in Mississippi during Reconstruction and served as Mississippi’s secretary of state in 1878.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P1'>Born on October 28, 1838, Falconer grew up in Holly Springs, Mississippi. As a young man he worked at the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Herald</hi> (his father’s newspaper) and attended the University of Mississippi, graduating in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. When the war broke out, Falconer enlisted in the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Recognized for his intelligence and writing ability, Falconer was soon promoted and moved to administrative and staff work, first serving as the private secretary and then adjutant general for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Later he served as a staff officer for Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P2'>After the defeat of the Confederacy, Falconer returned to Mississippi and reentered the newspaper business, becoming editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Holly Springs Reporter</hi>. He began fostering an interest state politics and unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor as a Democrat under Benjamin G. Humphreys in 1868. In 1870, Falconer stepped away from editorial duties at the <hi rend='italic'>Reporter</hi> to practice law full time. He continued participating in Democratic politics and in 1877 was elected secretary of state. He entered that office in January 1878. However, only a few months later, a yellow fever epidemic struck parts of Mississippi. Falconer’s brother and father were stricken by the mosquito-borne disease. He went to Holly Springs to aid in their care, but both men died. Falconer himself then came down with the disease and died on September 23, 1878. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS76359P0'>John H. Nelson was a Confederate officer, lawyer, judge, mayor, and grocery store merchant.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76359P1'>Born in Washington County, Mississippi, Nelson became a lawyer and a Probate Judge in the county before the Civil War. With the outbreak of the war, however, he resigned in order to enlist. He was a Second Lieutenant for the 28th Mississippi Regiment, but a chronic illness forced him to resign within the year.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76359P2'>After the war, Nelson returned to Greenville, Washington County, where he worked as a lawyer and was a co-owner in a grocery and retail firm called Nelson, Trigg, &amp; Co. By 1874, he was the mayor, but he resigned this position in October 1874 and left for St. Louis, Missouri. However, by September the following year, he returned to Greenville, citing St. Louis as "dull and spiritless." At that point, he partnered with S. D. Finlay to open a grocery and retail store. This partnership dissolved two years later in May 1877 when Finlay sold his interest to Nelson. Nelson named his business John H. Nelson &amp; Co.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS76359P3'>Nelson died on September 29, 1878 in Greenville, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63262P0'>While the Cambridge Dictionary defines death as “the end of life,” CWRGM employs this subject tag to refer to human deaths only, both actual and hypothetical. (Cambridge Dictionary)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.
