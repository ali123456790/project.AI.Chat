<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P1'>Born on October 28, 1838, Falconer grew up in Holly Springs, Mississippi. As a young man he worked at the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Herald</hi> (his father’s newspaper) and attended the University of Mississippi, graduating in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. When the war broke out, Falconer enlisted in the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Recognized for his intelligence and writing ability, Falconer was soon promoted and moved to administrative and staff work, first serving as the private secretary and then adjutant general for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Later he served as a staff officer for Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864.

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P2'>After the defeat of the Confederacy, Falconer returned to Mississippi and reentered the newspaper business, becoming editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Holly Springs Reporter</hi>. He began fostering an interest state politics and unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor as a Democrat under Benjamin G. Humphreys in 1868. In 1870, Falconer stepped away from editorial duties at the <hi rend='italic'>Reporter</hi> to practice law full time. He continued participating in Democratic politics and in 1877 was elected secretary of state. He entered that office in January 1878. However, only a few months later, a yellow fever epidemic struck parts of Mississippi. Falconer’s brother and father were stricken by the mosquito-borne disease. He went to Holly Springs to aid in their care, but both men died. Falconer himself then came down with the disease and died on September 23, 1878. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32095403P0'>James Davis Porter was an attorney, Confederate officer, and governor of Tennessee during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32095403P1'>Born on December 7, 1828, in Paris, Tennessee, received two degrees from the University of Nashville in the 1840s and then studied law at Cumberland University. He became a practicing attorney in 1851 and later entered state politics. Elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives as a Whig in 1859, he introduced resolutions which advocated for his state to side with the lower south during the secession crisis following Abraham Lincoln’s election to president in 1860. When the Civil War broke out in April 1861, following the Confederate attack on federal soldiers at Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Porter’s resolutions were adopted by the Tennessee legislature and helped lead that state to declare its own secession from the Union.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32095403P2'>Porter volunteered for Confederate military service and was commissioned as an officer, serving on the staffs of several Confederate generals during the Civil War. He participated in many notable battles of the western theater, including Shiloh, Chickamauga, and Atlanta.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32095403P3'>After the war ended, Porter returned to Paris, Tennessee, and resumed practicing law. He returned to the political scene in 1870, joining the Democratic Party, and serving as a delegate to Tennessee constitutional convention. Afterwards, he accepted an appointment as a circuit court judge. In 1874, Porter ran for governor of Tennessee.  He easily won against a Republican opponent and served two terms, leaving office in 1879. Porter focused much of his effort as governor to reduce the state’s debt, but he also promoted education, and supported anti-alcohol policies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32095403P4'>Upon leaving the governor’s office, Porter became involved in railroad business. Though successful, in 1885 he returned to public office, receiving appointment as Assistant Secretary of State under President Grover Cleveland, and then in 1893 accepting a diplomatic appointment as U.S. minister to Chile. Late in life Porter wrote a book about Tennessee during the Civil War and served as president of the Tennessee Historical Society.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32095403P5'>Porter died on May 18, 1912. He was married to Susannah Dunlap. The couple had six children, although only three survived to adulthood. Porter is buried in Paris City Cemetery in Paris, Tennessee.
