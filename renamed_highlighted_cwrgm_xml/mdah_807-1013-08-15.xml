                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32100941P0'>Kinloch Falconer was active in Democratic politics in Mississippi during Reconstruction and served as Mississippi’s secretary of state in 1878.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P1'>Born on October 28, 1838, Falconer grew up in Holly Springs, Mississippi. As a young man he worked at the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Herald</hi> (his father’s newspaper) and attended the University of Mississippi, graduating in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. When the war broke out, Falconer enlisted in the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Recognized for his intelligence and writing ability, Falconer was soon promoted and moved to administrative and staff work, first serving as the private secretary and then adjutant general for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Later he served as a staff officer for Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P2'>After the defeat of the Confederacy, Falconer returned to Mississippi and reentered the newspaper business, becoming editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Holly Springs Reporter</hi>. He began fostering an interest state politics and unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor as a Democrat under Benjamin G. Humphreys in 1868. In 1870, Falconer stepped away from editorial duties at the <hi rend='italic'>Reporter</hi> to practice law full time. He continued participating in Democratic politics and in 1877 was elected secretary of state. He entered that office in January 1878. However, only a few months later, a yellow fever epidemic struck parts of Mississippi. Falconer’s brother and father were stricken by the mosquito-borne disease. He went to Holly Springs to aid in their care, but both men died. Falconer himself then came down with the disease and died on September 23, 1878. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P0'>The United States during the nineteenth century saw great increases in literacy and general education. At the beginning of that century, approximately 70 percent of northerners and 60 percent of white southerners could read. By 1840, that number increased to roughly 93 percent of northerners and 80 percent of white southerners. (African American literacy rates were far lower, particularly in the south where many states had laws against teaching slaves and free Black people to read.) After the Civil War, literacy rates continued to rise, most drastically with freed people. In 1870, approximately 20 percent of Black Americans knew how to read. Due to new educational opportunities after emancipation—and despite the lack of support provided to Black schools by many discriminatory local governments—that number nearly tripled within thirty years, with 55 percent of African Americans being literate by 1900.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P1'>The general improvement of literacy and education in the United States spurred an increasing demand for printed information. At the same time, technological developments—such as improved paper production, better transportation and trade routes for the sale of paper and printing supplies, higher quality and faster printing machines, and rapid transmission of information through railroads and eventually telegraph—contributed to a boom in print media. This allowed aspiring newspaper editors to open their own publication in even small towns. In 1830, the United States had around 900 newspapers in publication (nearly double the number found in Great Britain at the same time). Only ten years later, more than 1,600 newspapers were in circulation; and in 1850 that number had grown to more than 2,500. In 1900, there were more than 20,000 American newspapers. Most were weekly publications, but the number of daily newspapers rose from 24 in 1820 to more than 250 in 1850, to more than 2,600 in 1900. Still, the annual numbers of newspapers mentioned above underrepresent the proliferation of print media activity, since they only include active newspaper companies counted during a formal census. Many newspapers lasted only a few months or years, before being replaced or purchased by a competitor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P2'>The nineteenth century also saw drastic improvement in the quality of mass production printing and book binding. This decreased the cost associated with manufacturing books, increased opportunities for writers to publish their work, and improved the amount of printed material for schools and professional organizations outside of the traditional cities and universities. It also increased the role of books as entertainment, rather than their previous primary purpose as sources of religious and academic information.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P3'>Technological developments greatly improved illustration printing during the nineteenth century. Lithography—a technique of transferring an image from a smooth piece of limestone to paper—had been invented in the 1790s in Bavaria. Over the next century, printers and publishers refined the technique to mass produce increasingly elaborate illustrations, including in color. The process still required an artist to produce, or reproduce, an image on limestone or specially prepared metal plate. However, average Americans were able to purchase highly decorative prints, books, calendars, and magazines. Lithography also revolutionized advertising during the latter part of the nineteenth century, as printers could produce elaborate advertisements for stores and other businesses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32088945P4'>Overall, the nineteenth century was a sort of golden era of print media. While printing and publishing continued to be a vital part of American culture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the invention of radio, television, and the internet reduced Americans’ reliance upon paper-based newspapers, magazines, and books for information and entertainment.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P0'>When the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, it failed to abolish involuntary servitude. The amendment included a loophole banning involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted" (Library of Congress). White southerners in the post-emancipation South, concerned about both the availability of labor and the freedom of African Americans, manipulated this clause and turned to convict leasing to entrench long standing racial hierarchies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P1'>Immediately after the war, many states passed "Black Codes" or laws severely limiting African Americans' rights. Under these codes and other similar laws passed in the decades following the Civil War, African Americans could be arrested for any number of petty crimes, including vagrancy (functionally construed to mean any act of social mobility not approved by a white person) or theft (in Mississippi a felony if exceeding $10 worth of goods). Widespread racism and stereotypes about Black criminality led to a dramatic expansion in the population of imprisoned individuals and an overwhelming number of African Americans within that population. Many states leased those convicted persons to private companies or individuals for their labor, and in certain cases lessees had been the pre-emancipation enslaver of the leased.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P2'>Laborers worked in a variety of settings including shipbuilding and timber cutting, yet the most prominent form in states like Mississippi remained large-scale agricultural work. The convict lease system was incredibly dangerous and difficult for those who lived through it, as leased persons faced unsafe working conditions, inadequate living conditions, abuse from lessees, and grueling work schedules. Given these circumstances, the ready availability of imprisoned laborers, and the callousness of lessees and state officials, the mortality rate among convict laborers was incredibly high.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P3'>Certain states ceased leasing imprisoned persons to individuals or private companies in the late nineteenth century, only to continue using that labor on state-funded infrastructure projects like road or highway construction until, in some cases, World War II. Southern individuals and states thereby continued to increase their wealth through the coerced labor of African Americans while perpetuating anti-Black racism and laying the foundations of the modern prison-industrial complex (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P0'>In the wake of the Civil War, many states turned to convict leasing to bolster infrastructural repair and to maintain long standing racial hierarchies. Like many other southern states, Mississippi instituted a convict leasing program, and in 1876 the state passed the Leasing Act (commonly known as the “Pig Law”), which sentenced anyone who stole property valued at $10 or greater up to five years in prison and quadrupled the prison population, with Black prisoners comprising approximately 85% of inmates. The state most frequently leased convicted persons to individuals, primarily to perform agricultural work on cotton farms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P1'>However, the state also leased incarcerated persons to private companies, such as the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company, and companies subjected convict-laborers to excruciating working conditions with little shelter, sustenance, or medical care. While companies and private individuals leased enslaved workers during the antebellum era, enslavers expected “their human chattel to be returned alive and in good working condition” (Sturkey, <hi rend='italic'>Hattiesburg</hi>). However, this expectation was virtually nonexistent in postwar convict leasing programs. The death toll therefore grew to staggering heights. In response, Mississippi cancelled Gulf &amp; Ship Island’s contract in December 1888 and ceased leasing convicts to private companies in 1890. However, the state and individual counties and towns continued to use convict labor for public works projects and at the state’s penitentiary at Parchman plantation well into the twentieth century (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32031023P0'>Like many slaveholding states of the former Confederacy, Mississippi operated a convict leasing system between the 1860s–1900s. Under convict leasing systems, states leased imprisoned people to perform unfree labor for companies and individuals in exchange for a fee. State and county laws (such as "Pig Laws" and vagrancy laws) and racially selective prosecutions funneled large, overrepresented populations of African Americans into their prison institutions. Therefore, Mississippi's convict leasing system replaced the state's former system of race-based chattel slavery and laborers encountered harsh conditions, violent punishments, and high death tolls. Public outcry over these conditions, especially following the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company's convict leasing practices, forced Mississippi to abolish its convict leasing program in 1890, becoming the first state to do so. County governments, however, continued to operate convict leasing arrangements using chain gangs until the 1900s. In 1904 Mississippi opened Parchman Prison on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta and consolidated much of its convict labor there. (Mississippi Encyclopedia)

While religious and private groups had addressed social reform issues during previous decades, the association was among the first in the United States to formally bring together professionals from various fields (including physicians, attorneys, teachers, and businessmen) to cooperate on social and political solutions. The American Social Science Association operated under the framework that people are social beings and that societal improvements required studying and addressing human relations in four categories: education, health, finance, and jurisprudence (law). The organization later added a fifth category, named “social economy.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32167697P1'>The American Social Science Association helped illustrate the value of cooperative work among professionals in various fields, and spawned the creation of specialized organizations, such as the National Prison Association, the American Health Association, and the National Conference of Charities in the 1870s. The trend of members from various fields, especially university professors, establishing organizations for their respective fields eventually weakened the association. The American Historical Association, the American Economic Association, and the American Academy of Political and Social Science emerged in the 1880s, while the American Political Science Association and the American Sociological Society formed around the turn of the century. By the early twentieth century, the large number of independent, specialized groups reduced the American Social Science Association’s influence and purpose, and it was essentially defunct. The remnants of the association were absorbed into the National Institute of Social Sciences in 1928. (“American Social Science Association [ASSA],” The History of Economic Though; Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32086326P0'>A charitable organization, or charity, is a group dedicated to providing support, through funds or other resources, to people in need. Early charities were most often religiously-based, inspired by tenets of the faith to care for people. During the Enlightenment era of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which emphasized philanthropy, education, and equality among people, some wealthy individuals established charities. This continued into the nineteenth century, especially with the Industrial Revolution which saw the influx of people into harsh living conditions in cities and manufacturing areas. A small number of charities have been guided by political interests (ie. providing resources to people to curry favor), or financial benefits, such as tax reductions. Charitable groups typically provide food, medical support, clothing, and education to those in poverty, or suffering due to natural or man-made disasters. Some charity efforts involved the long-term, or permanent institutions, such as hospitals, orphanages, schools. Most charities are volunteer or non-profit organizations, where members are not paid for their work and all funds not needed for the actual functioning of the charity are dedicated to providing resources to others.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD91463P0'>"A legal guardian is a person who has been appointed by a court or otherwise has the legal authority (and the corresponding duty) to make decisions relevant to the personal and property interests of another person who is deemed incompetent, called a ward" (Wikipedia). Guardian and ward relationships can arise from numerous different circumstances, including a child with deceased parents or parents deemed unfit to care for the child, a person with a mental or physical disability incapable of caring for themselves, or an elderly person incapable of living independently. While guardianships are meant to protect the ward, these relationships have historically been subject to varied forms of physical, psychological, or financial abuse. In the nineteenth century, guardianships arose frequently due to high mortality rates, few legal protections for women, and widespread poverty. Impoverished children particularly fell subject to being placed in guardianships, taken away from living parents, and put into orphanages operated by respective states (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 454-457).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD52163P0'>In the nineteenth-century United States, the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses advanced dramatically, though by 1900 it certainly still had far to go. In colonial America, mental illnesses were largely perceived as acts of God and thus inescapable and incurable. American society therefore dealt with people suffering from mental illnesses primarily through charitable organizations or benevolent societies like churches or almshouses.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P1'>Throughout the nineteenth century, however, as the ideals of the Enlightenment continued to evolve, Americans developed a more institutional, scientific approach to understanding and treating mental illnesses as curable and in turn developing the field of psychiatry. Psychiatrists and state governments founded state-funded asylums to study and treat people with mental illnesses in isolation to prevent both interruption of treatment and danger to society. While nineteenth-century psychiatrists employed many terms no longer accepted to describe mental illnesses, and while the methods they employed in their asylums have likewise been largely dismissed, the study and treatment of mental illness in the United States advanced rapidly in the nineteenth century in tandem with greater societal and educational reforms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P2'>It is critical to note, however, that much of this advancement was aided by slavery. The Eastern Lunatic Asylum of Virginia, for example, relied on enslaved people as both patients and caregivers, and ideas about blackness and insanity were often mutually dependent. (Wendy Gonaver, The Peculiar Institution and the Making of Modern Psychiatry, 1840–1880).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD52163P3'>One notable, and widespread, mental illness afflicting Americans in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries was the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) experienced by many Civil War veterans. While psychiatry had evolved over the century, its failure to diagnose and treat widespread PTSD glaringly reveals its limits (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 283-285).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD96659P0'>Impoverished people are those who lack "a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions," or alternately those who "lack the means to satisfy their basic needs (Britannica). This definition, necessarily subjective and broad, indicates that what one person or society deems "socially acceptable" or what constitutes "basic needs" is malleable.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P1'>Similarly, impoverished people in the United States in the nineteenth century did not fit one specific category. The rise of industrialism produced an increased number of impoverished people in the U. S., particularly within large urban centers. European immigrants in cities in the East, and Chinese immigrants on the West Coast, and African Americans in the South were disproportionately affected by poverty. Regionally, the highest number of impoverished people came from the U. S. South, where "both whites and African Americans struggled with debt, low cotton prices, laws favorable to employers and creditors, paltry alternatives, and the general post war devastation" (Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, 547).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD96659P2'>Racism and nativism among employers and employees also made economic advancement more difficult for people of color and immigrants. However, the impoverished made up a comparatively low percentage of Mississippi's antebellum population, given its low number of immigrants and even native residents, lack of industrialization and urbanization, and mobility of those that were impoverished (Mississippi Encyclopedia). Many reform organizations throughout the country took the lead in fighting poverty in the nineteenth century, while state and federal governments by the end of the century also developed its own institutional responses. The status of being impoverished has always carried negative connotations in American history, so CWRGM uses the tag "Impoverished people" to emphasize the personhood of those in poverty rather than their social status.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).
