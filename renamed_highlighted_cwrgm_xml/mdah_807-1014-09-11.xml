                    <p xml:id='OTPS32120660P0'>Abijah R. Brewer was an executive in the Western Union Telegraph Company in the late nineteenth century. Born in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, on May 3, 1847, Brewer began working at a newspaper office at the age of 15. He studied telegraphy during his free time and became a telegraph operator at the American Telegraph Company in Trenton. In 1875 he was appointed Secretary of the Western Union Telegraph Company and served in that capacity for more than twenty years. Brewer became the Western Union treasurer in 1909 and was subsequently promoted to vice president of the company in 1915. He retired after working more than fifty years for Western Union. Near the end of his life he served a term as mayor of Glen Ridge, New Jersey. Brewer died on November 6, 1919.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32022396P0'>William Orton was a businessman during the nineteenth century, most famously known as the president of the Western Union Telegraph Company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022396P1'>Born in Cuba, New York, on June 14, 1826, Orton was trained as a newspaper printer and then went to school to become a teacher. After teaching for several years and working in a book store, he went into the publishing business with various partners, operating Derby, Orton &amp; Company and then Miller &amp; Orton, before working as the managing clerk for J. G. Gregory &amp; Company. In the early 1860s, Orton became involved in public office, serving on New York City’s Common Council, the Collector of Revenue in New York, and then as Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Washington, D.C.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022396P2'>In 1865, Orton left his job in Washington, D.C., to become president of the United States Telegraph Company. A year later, the company merged with Western Union and he was made vice president. Aside from this executive job, Orton studied law and was admitted to the bar (accepted as a professional attorney) in 1867. That same year, the president of the Western Union Telegraph Company, Jeptha Wade, resigned, and Orton took his place. He jointly became president of the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company, the International Ocean Telegraph Company, and Atlantic and Southern Telegraph Company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022396P3'>Orton died of apoplexy (a stroke or cerebral hemorrhage) in New York City on April 22, 1878, at the age of 51. He was married to Agnes J. Gillespie and had eight children. Orton is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32084772P0'>George Smith Houston was a politician, who served in the U.S. Congress and as governor of Alabama during the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32084772P1'>Born on January 17, 1811, near Franklin, Tennessee, Houston moved to Alabama as a teenager with his family. He apprenticed at a law firm in Alabama before attending law school in Kentucky. After becoming a practicing attorney, Houston entered local politics, winning an election to the Alabama legislature in 1831 as a Democrat. He later served as a district solicitor, and then won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1840.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32084772P2'>Although a Democrat, and slave owner, Houston did not follow the party’s leadership in their extreme defense of slavery’s expansion into the federal territories gained from the Mexican-American War in the 1840s. The position hurt him politically, and he declined to run for reelection in 1848. However, he rebounded and won election to Congress in 1850, spending the next decade in that office. Immediately following Abraham Lincoln’s victory in the 1860 presidential election, Houston was selected to represent Alabama in the Committee of Thirty-three—a neffort that gathered one representative from each state to establish a compromise between northern and southern states and prevent secession. The committee supported the Corwin Amendment, a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would formally prohibit the federal government from interfering with slavery within any state in the Union. Although endorsed by outgoing president James Buchanan and incoming president Abraham Lincoln, the amendment failed to appease southern secessionists, in large part because it did not guarantee protections for the institution slavery in the territories, which was the central point of contention in the political battle over the future of slavery.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32084772P3'>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Houston resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives and returned to Alabama. He largely remained out of the military conflict, although his sons fought for the Confederacy and his property was raided by Union soldiers. After the war, Houston briefly resumed his political career. He was elected U.S. Senator in Alabama, but was refused his seat in Washington, D.C., when Republican officials objected to the Reconstruction efforts by former Confederates. After an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 1867, he stepped away again from politics.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32084772P4'>In 1875, Houston won election as governor of Alabama. He defeated a Republican incumbent, and started Democratic domination of the Alabama governor’s office that lasted more than a century. Houston championed a rejection of Republican Reconstruction policies and a return to white supremacy. In 1878, he again ran for the U.S. Senate and won. However, he died only a year later, on December 31, 1879. He was married twice, first to Mary Beatty, with whom he had eight children (although only four survived to adulthood). Mary died in 1860 and Houston married Ellen Irvin in 1861, and had two more children. Houston is buried in Athens City Cemetery in Athens, Alabama.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077913P0'>Headquartered in Rochester, New York, the Western Union Telegraph Company was a telegraph company established in 1851. Before the Civil War, the telegraph was a growing technology, but Western Union brought it to the national stage, especially upon the completion of the transcontinental line in 1861. Western Union Telegraph Company provided near-instantaneous communication between the Union government and its far-reaching troops, allowing for faster troop movement, supply coordination, and battlefield updates. Western Union also facilitated communication between families, boosting morale and providing vital wartime news. However, the war fractured the network as Confederate and Union forces targeted telegraph lines, disrupting communication and necessitating constant repairs. The South relied on a separate system, hindering Confederate coordination and leaving them at an informational disadvantage. During Reconstruction, Western Union facilitated communication between the federal government and freed people, by relaying news of political and social developments, and Black communities seized the technology to organize their efforts in the fight for civil rights. However, Western Union's power faced criticism for its role in suppressing dissent and reinforcing control during Reconstruction. (Wikipedia; Western Union; National Archives; Smithsonian)In 1851, the Western Union telegraph company was founded in Rochester, NY under the name the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company. In 1856, the company merged with the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company and was renamed the Western Union Telegraph Company. An innovator in technology, by October 1861, it completed the first transcontinental telegraph by sending a message from the west coast to President Abraham Lincoln on the east coast. This accomplishment set the stage for the company to dominate the telegraph industry in the United States after the Civil War. In 1871, it also pioneered wire money transfer, which increasingly became the focus of the company throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Western Union company continues today as a strictly money-transferring industry, having abandoned its communications operations in 2006. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.
