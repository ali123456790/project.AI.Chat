                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).

</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD63262P1'>The nation experienced mass loss of life (approximately 2% of the population) during the American Civil War, which changed the way Americans viewed death and resulted in its reconceptualization in highly bureaucratized ways. Often wartime dead were buried without their names and sometimes in poorly-dug graves, which created a powerful, profound social and cultural dislocation for their surviving loved ones. During the 19th century, Americans understood dying as a social and religious experience, and desired a "good death," which they defined as at home surrounded by family, but these ideals were unattainable in war. Consequently, Americans learned to cope with death and memorialize it in new ways. Unionists encouraged the federal government and ex-Confederates pushed their respective state governments to create and fund national cemeteries, rebury deceases soldiers and veterans, and establish veterans' and widows' pensions. These new responses to death were more bureaucratized, nationalistic, and secularized. Wartime and post-war death was also highly impacted by race, as white supremacists desecrated the graves of Union buried in the South, especially the bodies of African Americans who served in U.S. Colored Troops and the white officers that led them, revealing post-war sectionalism and strains on reconciliation.

<p corresp='TTP34742830P3' xml:id='OTP34742830P3'>Your very kind favor of the 12<add place='above'><hi rend='underline'>th</hi></add> is this hour recieved. I thank you truly for the interest you take, and desire you express for <rs ref='#S94074'>my friend</rs>, "that you would rejoice to learn something in connection with the case of Mr. <rs ref='#S32167985'>Burt</rs> that would justify" you to grant his <rs ref='#S32019844'>release</rs>. O! that this light and knowledge may be found—that you may know the truth in this case—If you did now, and had known it ^as it is.^ I believe you would have released Mr. Burt months past.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP34742830P4' xml:id='OTP34742830P4'>True your action must be by the the best information you can obtain relative to the case upon which he was <rs ref='#S32121282'>tried</rs> and <rs ref='#S71046'>convicted</rs> of some true messenger from the source of all good, conveyed to you the truth that—those people who hired this stranger the horse—And also those who <rs ref='#S62954'>apprehended</rs>—tried, <rs ref='#S32074731'>accused</rs> and <rs ref='#S32021053'>Scentenced</rs> him to long and severe punishment when he was innocent, misunderstood him ^would you not regard it?^ The man who hired the horse to Mr. Burt and permited him to take it away knew he was a stranger, there was great chance for a misunderstanding between them. I doubt that the real truth can be known of that ten minutes acts, thoughts and sayings of those two then. Serious consequences, perhaps <rs ref='#S63262'>the loss of life</rs> to my friend, result from it. Also if the messenger told you there was no need of the apprehension and suspicion of those people, and the Officers trying Mr. Burt—making such a great matte^r^ of it—when if they had have waited a reasonable time for him to go to <rs ref='#S52152'>Brownsville in Hines County Miss.</rs> and return after visiting his friends there, he would have brought the horse back to them all right. Is there not great reason to think becasue he was a stranger they judged him more severely. If it had been a man they knew ther^e^ they would have thought nothing of it, excused all the delay and wrong he did, and if he had not been partily deranged—not clear and sane in mind these sad circumstances would not have taken place, not existed.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP34742830P5' xml:id='OTP34742830P5'>Two other men of this place similarly affected as he was in mind then have destroyed their natural life since he was here. I look up to our Father with true grate-full praise that the life of this man is yet spaired and think his mercy and goodness is even.

          <p corresp='TTP34742831P0' xml:id='OTP34742831P0'>It was Aug. 16—we first heard from him, when he had been in prison about 4 months. He wanted to write to some to help him when first put in—they did not furnish paper and material for writing. It is evident they did not wish to favor him.
</p>

<p corresp='TTP34742831P1' xml:id='OTP34742831P1'>I suppose you feel bound to accept and act by the judgement of this <rs ref='#S63934'>Judge</rs> <rs ref='#S102194'>Young</rs> and <rs ref='#S50807'>Clerk</rs>, yet I do hope you will consider well the truth of this matter as it was. Do you not see it plain, a stranger in the land will not recieve the just treat-ment of the people or officers that a citizen does, he being in not a good usual state of mind needed charity and kindness—aid instead of punishment—could scarcely exist before—now is crushed dying—who will be the good Samaritan to raise him up—restore him to life? He can be made a good useful citizen if some will not hinder. You have been very patient and kind to me and hope will not be wearied with these lines. I yet trust in your justice and mercy and <rs ref='#S62927'>pardon</rs> for my friend. I believe there is more truth for than against Mr. B. This copy of letter you sent showed no guilt or wrong of his except, if it be true that he offered the horse for sale, and said he should return sooner than he did, which was not reasonable that he could by the distance there, this may be a mistake of the witnesses. With pleasure I answere your request where Mr. Burt hired. It was on Mrs. <rs ref='#S32174229'>A. E. Furgason's</rs> <rs ref='#S91218'>farm</rs> 9. Nine miles from Brownsville—I suppose in Hines <rs ref='#S32174230'>Leo. Bolton</rs> <rs ref='#S32005095'>Depot</rs> about the same distance from Mrs. F.'s is in Hines Co. I directed most of my letters to this last place, to him then in 1876—I do not know where or when he was taken with the horse, suppose at Mrs. Furgasons. She wrote to him soon after, that no one there believed him guilty of <rs ref='#S63925'>stealing the horse</rs>—that he had no such thought or intention. She wrote me last Nov. 7 to prepare a petition and send to you to reprieve Mr. Burt—wished me to not think hard of her for not helping me to get him clear—Becasuse I would be disliked by my neighbors for it, she said there was a story there that lately he was not good here. I wrote her that he did not think it so bad as others and thought he felt the matter for me to settle and that it would be all right. That his mind was the cause of all his troubles, and he was not well in body. He needed pity and compassion shown and forgiveness even as Christ would show and grant unto us. I have written this in much haste. The weather is extremely warm, your last clauses are precious to me. May God help you to grant my request. My mind is with Mr. B much of the time in the burning field at his work, with his hot painful head, feeling very sad, far from friends last and dying—earnestly desiring to be released from that severe affliction restored to peace and freedom. Please grant it and may God bless you. None of those <rs ref='#S94600'>lawyers</rs> have answered these here, does not make any difference. I depend on you the Chief Executive. With high honor.
