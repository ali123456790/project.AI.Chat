                    <p xml:id='OTPS32022396P0'>William Orton was a businessman during the nineteenth century, most famously known as the president of the Western Union Telegraph Company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022396P1'>Born in Cuba, New York, on June 14, 1826, Orton was trained as a newspaper printer and then went to school to become a teacher. After teaching for several years and working in a book store, he went into the publishing business with various partners, operating Derby, Orton &amp; Company and then Miller &amp; Orton, before working as the managing clerk for J. G. Gregory &amp; Company. In the early 1860s, Orton became involved in public office, serving on New York City’s Common Council, the Collector of Revenue in New York, and then as Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Washington, D.C.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022396P2'>In 1865, Orton left his job in Washington, D.C., to become president of the United States Telegraph Company. A year later, the company merged with Western Union and he was made vice president. Aside from this executive job, Orton studied law and was admitted to the bar (accepted as a professional attorney) in 1867. That same year, the president of the Western Union Telegraph Company, Jeptha Wade, resigned, and Orton took his place. He jointly became president of the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company, the International Ocean Telegraph Company, and Atlantic and Southern Telegraph Company.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32022396P3'>Orton died of apoplexy (a stroke or cerebral hemorrhage) in New York City on April 22, 1878, at the age of 51. He was married to Agnes J. Gillespie and had eight children. Orton is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077913P0'>Headquartered in Rochester, New York, the Western Union Telegraph Company was a telegraph company established in 1851. Before the Civil War, the telegraph was a growing technology, but Western Union brought it to the national stage, especially upon the completion of the transcontinental line in 1861. Western Union Telegraph Company provided near-instantaneous communication between the Union government and its far-reaching troops, allowing for faster troop movement, supply coordination, and battlefield updates. Western Union also facilitated communication between families, boosting morale and providing vital wartime news. However, the war fractured the network as Confederate and Union forces targeted telegraph lines, disrupting communication and necessitating constant repairs. The South relied on a separate system, hindering Confederate coordination and leaving them at an informational disadvantage. During Reconstruction, Western Union facilitated communication between the federal government and freed people, by relaying news of political and social developments, and Black communities seized the technology to organize their efforts in the fight for civil rights. However, Western Union's power faced criticism for its role in suppressing dissent and reinforcing control during Reconstruction. (Wikipedia; Western Union; National Archives; Smithsonian)In 1851, the Western Union telegraph company was founded in Rochester, NY under the name the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company. In 1856, the company merged with the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company and was renamed the Western Union Telegraph Company. An innovator in technology, by October 1861, it completed the first transcontinental telegraph by sending a message from the west coast to President Abraham Lincoln on the east coast. This accomplishment set the stage for the company to dominate the telegraph industry in the United States after the Civil War. In 1871, it also pioneered wire money transfer, which increasingly became the focus of the company throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Western Union company continues today as a strictly money-transferring industry, having abandoned its communications operations in 2006. (Wikipedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.
