                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS25018171P0'>Jones S. Hamilton was a Confederate officer who later became a wealthy railroad investor and businessman in Mississippi.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P1'>Born on April 19, 1833, in Wilkinson County, Mississippi, Hamilton was educated in Mississippi and then graduated from Centenary College in Louisiana. He served as sheriff of Wilkinson County during the late 1850s but resigned the position to volunteer for Confederate military service when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He served in a Mississippi unit in the Army of Northern Virginia, eventually attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war, Hamilton settled in Jackson, Mississippi, and held various public positions, including the deputy state auditor, adjutant general in the Mississippi militia, and a state senator. Most notably, he gained fame and wealth through railroad projects and commercial enterprises. Hamilton was credited with driving much of the infrastructure and railroad development in southern Mississippi. He also became strongly associated with the convict leasing program, where his companies paid the state to use prisoners from Mississippi’s penitentiary as laborers on public works and construction projects. By the late nineteenth century, Hamilton was a millionaire.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P2'>Hamilton’s financial success and business methods drew criticism from some, and in the 1880s he became embroiled in a dispute with a newspaper editor named Roderick Gambrell. The feud led to a duel in which Hamilton killed Gambrell. He was acquitted, but the incident underscored the controversy surrounding him and contributed to perceptions like that written by the <hi rend='italic'>Vicksburg American</hi>, who noted that “no man connected with public affairs of Mississippi . . . had led a more eventful, and to a certain extent, checkered, career than Jones S. Hamilton.”
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS25018171P3'>Hamilton died on January 21, 1907. He had been married twice, first to Carolina Augusta Stewart in 1856, with whom he had two children. She died in 1861 and he later married Fannie Buck in 1877 and had five additional children. Hamilton is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32100941P0'>Kinloch Falconer was active in Democratic politics in Mississippi during Reconstruction and served as Mississippi’s secretary of state in 1878.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P1'>Born on October 28, 1838, Falconer grew up in Holly Springs, Mississippi. As a young man he worked at the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Herald</hi> (his father’s newspaper) and attended the University of Mississippi, graduating in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. When the war broke out, Falconer enlisted in the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Recognized for his intelligence and writing ability, Falconer was soon promoted and moved to administrative and staff work, first serving as the private secretary and then adjutant general for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Later he served as a staff officer for Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P2'>After the defeat of the Confederacy, Falconer returned to Mississippi and reentered the newspaper business, becoming editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Holly Springs Reporter</hi>. He began fostering an interest state politics and unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor as a Democrat under Benjamin G. Humphreys in 1868. In 1870, Falconer stepped away from editorial duties at the <hi rend='italic'>Reporter</hi> to practice law full time. He continued participating in Democratic politics and in 1877 was elected secretary of state. He entered that office in January 1878. However, only a few months later, a yellow fever epidemic struck parts of Mississippi. Falconer’s brother and father were stricken by the mosquito-borne disease. He went to Holly Springs to aid in their care, but both men died. Falconer himself then came down with the disease and died on September 23, 1878. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32152820P0'>Established in 1876, J. S. Hamilton &amp; Co. (also known as Hamilton &amp; Hebron and Hoskins &amp; Hamilton) was a business operated by Jones S. Hamilton, John L. Hebron, James A. Hoskins, and William H. Gibbs that privatized the penitentiary system in Mississippi by leasing prisoners from the state. The company and its convict leasing business model was championed by Democratic politicians in Mississippi as they took majority rule over Republicans near the end of Reconstruction. Rather than pay for badly needed repairs in the state prison system, the Mississippi government leased its entire prison population to J. S. Hamilton &amp; Co., which in turn subleased the convicts to labor projects and plantation owners. The company also used prisoners for manufacturing several consumer products, such as wagons, plows, tables, picture frames, leather boots, and shoes, all sold directly by J.S. Hamilton &amp; Co, and it offered contracting for railroads, including the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad, and other public improvements.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32152820P1'>Democratic politicians celebrated the convict leasing program, claiming that it brought money to the state treasury, and they recommended the privatization and leasing of the penitentiary system to prison officials in other states. (Indeed, Alabama authorized convict leasing from 1876 until 1928, reporting in 1898 that the income from leased convict labor accounted for 73% of the state’s revenue that year.) The Mississippi legislature leased the penitentiary to J. S. Hamilton &amp; Co. through at least 1883. In 1890, Mississippi prohibited the leasing of convict labor, and J. S. Hamilton &amp; Co. must have closed then if not in the years prior.

Gibbs and was in operation at least from 1876 to 1883. multi-faceted company involved in convict leasing, railroad contracting, and manufacturing. In June 1876, it was awarded the Mississippi Board of Penetentiary's contract for leasing convict labor, and this cheap labor was crucial to its success. The company offered contracting for railroad work, including the Gulf &amp; Ship Island railroad, and other public improvements and was a manufacturer of wagons, agricultural equipment, and leather. Manufacturing often took place within the penetentiary walls. In 1890, Mississippi prohibited the leasing of convict labor, and J. S. Hamilton &amp; Co. must have closed then if not in the years prior.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32179352P0'>In the U.S., convict leasing began as early as 1823 in New York and 1844 in Louisiana. Convict leasing brokers were individuals or private companies who would often lease all of the state's convicts before subleasing them to others individuals at increased rates, generally for agricultural labor.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32179352P1'>After the Civil War, although the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, it included a loophole banning involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted" (Library of Congress). White southerners in the post-emancipation South, concerned about both the availability of labor and the freedom of Black people, manipulated this clause and turned to convict leasing to entrench long standing racial hierarchies and to replace enslaved labor. In certain cases, the lessee had been the pre-emancipation enslaver of the leased convict.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32179352P2'>Peaking around 1880, this system was highly lucrative for the states and convict leasing brokers. Prison populations increased across the South, directly reflecting demands. And through the South's Black Codes, which severely limited the rights of formerly enslaved people, Black men and women could be arrested for a number of petty crimes. Widespread racism and stereotypes about Black criminality ensured that convict labor leasing fell most heavily on Black men, although there were some white men and Black women.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32179352P3'>Working conditions were harsh and exploitative, with convicts receiving brutal punishments and little shelter, food, or medical care. Companies and private individuals did also lease enslaved workers during the antebellum era, but enslavers expected these workers to be "returned alive and in good working condition." (Sturkey, <hi rend='italic'>Hattiesburg</hi>) These protections did not extend to convict laborers, and the resulting death tolls were staggering.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32179352P4'>Negative publicity for the system led convict labor leasing to be phased out over the course of the early-twentieth-century, with Alabama being the last state to officially end it in 1928. However, individual counties across the South, continued it for many years, and the states themselves often continued using convict labor for state-funded infrastructure projects like road or highway construction until, in some cases, World War II. Southern individuals and states thereby continued to increase their wealth through the coerced labor of Black men while perpetuating anti-Black racism. This also laid the foundations of the modern prison system.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P0'>When the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, it failed to abolish involuntary servitude. The amendment included a loophole banning involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted" (Library of Congress). White southerners in the post-emancipation South, concerned about both the availability of labor and the freedom of African Americans, manipulated this clause and turned to convict leasing to entrench long standing racial hierarchies.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P1'>Immediately after the war, many states passed "Black Codes" or laws severely limiting African Americans' rights. Under these codes and other similar laws passed in the decades following the Civil War, African Americans could be arrested for any number of petty crimes, including vagrancy (functionally construed to mean any act of social mobility not approved by a white person) or theft (in Mississippi a felony if exceeding $10 worth of goods). Widespread racism and stereotypes about Black criminality led to a dramatic expansion in the population of imprisoned individuals and an overwhelming number of African Americans within that population. Many states leased those convicted persons to private companies or individuals for their labor, and in certain cases lessees had been the pre-emancipation enslaver of the leased.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P2'>Laborers worked in a variety of settings including shipbuilding and timber cutting, yet the most prominent form in states like Mississippi remained large-scale agricultural work. The convict lease system was incredibly dangerous and difficult for those who lived through it, as leased persons faced unsafe working conditions, inadequate living conditions, abuse from lessees, and grueling work schedules. Given these circumstances, the ready availability of imprisoned laborers, and the callousness of lessees and state officials, the mortality rate among convict laborers was incredibly high.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075074P3'>Certain states ceased leasing imprisoned persons to individuals or private companies in the late nineteenth century, only to continue using that labor on state-funded infrastructure projects like road or highway construction until, in some cases, World War II. Southern individuals and states thereby continued to increase their wealth through the coerced labor of African Americans while perpetuating anti-Black racism and laying the foundations of the modern prison-industrial complex (Library of Congress; Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P0'>In the wake of the Civil War, many states turned to convict leasing to bolster infrastructural repair and to maintain long standing racial hierarchies. Like many other southern states, Mississippi instituted a convict leasing program, and in 1876 the state passed the Leasing Act (commonly known as the “Pig Law”), which sentenced anyone who stole property valued at $10 or greater up to five years in prison and quadrupled the prison population, with Black prisoners comprising approximately 85% of inmates. The state most frequently leased convicted persons to individuals, primarily to perform agricultural work on cotton farms.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32077340P1'>However, the state also leased incarcerated persons to private companies, such as the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company, and companies subjected convict-laborers to excruciating working conditions with little shelter, sustenance, or medical care. While companies and private individuals leased enslaved workers during the antebellum era, enslavers expected “their human chattel to be returned alive and in good working condition” (Sturkey, <hi rend='italic'>Hattiesburg</hi>). However, this expectation was virtually nonexistent in postwar convict leasing programs. The death toll therefore grew to staggering heights. In response, Mississippi cancelled Gulf &amp; Ship Island’s contract in December 1888 and ceased leasing convicts to private companies in 1890. However, the state and individual counties and towns continued to use convict labor for public works projects and at the state’s penitentiary at Parchman plantation well into the twentieth century (Mississippi Encyclopedia).

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32031023P0'>Like many slaveholding states of the former Confederacy, Mississippi operated a convict leasing system between the 1860s–1900s. Under convict leasing systems, states leased imprisoned people to perform unfree labor for companies and individuals in exchange for a fee. State and county laws (such as "Pig Laws" and vagrancy laws) and racially selective prosecutions funneled large, overrepresented populations of African Americans into their prison institutions. Therefore, Mississippi's convict leasing system replaced the state's former system of race-based chattel slavery and laborers encountered harsh conditions, violent punishments, and high death tolls. Public outcry over these conditions, especially following the Gulf &amp; Ship Island Railroad Company's convict leasing practices, forced Mississippi to abolish its convict leasing program in 1890, becoming the first state to do so. County governments, however, continued to operate convict leasing arrangements using chain gangs until the 1900s. In 1904 Mississippi opened Parchman Prison on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta and consolidated much of its convict labor there. (Mississippi Encyclopedia)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD94074P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary defines and imprisoned person as "a person who is kept in prison as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary). CWRGM, however, adopts the subject tag "Imprisoned people" to emphasize the personhood of those who have been imprisoned for crimes. This tag recognizes the systemic injustice and dehumanization historically present in the American carceral system wherein many have been falsely convicted and therefore uses the term "imprisoned" to reflect a person's having been placed in prison, while giving primacy to their personhood and not rendering judgement on that person's guilt (Akiba Solomon, "Words We Use," The Marshall Project).
