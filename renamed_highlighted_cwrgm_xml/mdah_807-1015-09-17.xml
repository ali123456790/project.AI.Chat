                    <p xml:id='OTPS74795P0'>John Marshall Stone served as governor of Mississippi two separate times, from 1876 to 1882 and from 1890 to 1896.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P1'>Born in Milan, Tennessee, on March 29, 1876, Stone grew up mostly in poverty but worked for his education and eventually became a school teacher. He moved to Mississippi in the mid-1850s and found work as a railroad station agent at Iuka, Mississippi. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Stone joined the Confederate army. He was placed in command of Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Proving capable in battle during campaigns in Virginia, he was promoted in 1862 to colonel of the regiment and received high praise from his superiors during the rest of the war. Stone led his regiment until near the end of the war, when he was captured in North Carolina and sent to Ohio as a prisoner.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P2'>Upon his release after the Civil War, Stone returned to Mississippi and resumed his work with the Mississippi and Ohio Railroad at Iuka. He married Mary G. Coman in 1872 and had two children, both of whom died before adulthood. Stone and his wife also adopted and raised three of his nephews.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P3'>He entered politics in 1869, winning election to the Mississippi state senate as a Democrat. In 1873 and 1874, Democrats in Mississippi gained majority power following campaigns of voter intimidation and violence against African Americans and Republicans. Stone worked his way to president pro tempore of the Senate during this period. In 1876, the Democrat majority in the state legislature carried out an impeachment campaign against top Republican officials, including Governor Adelbert Ames and Lieutenant Governor Alexander K. Davis. When Davis was impeached and Ames was forced to resign to avoid a costly lawsuit against politically-driven impeachment charges, Stone became next in line for governor. He was sworn into office in March 1876.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS74795P4'>Stone served as acting-governor for a year and a half and then won the gubernatorial election in 1877, running as the sole candidate. He lost reelection in 1881 to Robert Lowry, but retained his interest in the governor’s office and ran again—and won—in 1889.  Mississippi adopted a new constitution in 1890, which in part extended Stone’s gubernatorial term until 1896 to aid the transition of new policies. The new constitution prohibited successive gubernatorial terms. Thus, Stone could not run for immediate reelection. Upon leaving office, he received an appointment as president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. He died in 1900 and is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

                    <p xml:id='OTPS32100941P0'>Kinloch Falconer was active in Democratic politics in Mississippi during Reconstruction and served as Mississippi’s secretary of state in 1878.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P1'>Born on October 28, 1838, Falconer grew up in Holly Springs, Mississippi. As a young man he worked at the <hi rend='italic'>Southern Herald</hi> (his father’s newspaper) and attended the University of Mississippi, graduating in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. When the war broke out, Falconer enlisted in the 9th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Recognized for his intelligence and writing ability, Falconer was soon promoted and moved to administrative and staff work, first serving as the private secretary and then adjutant general for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Later he served as a staff officer for Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32100941P2'>After the defeat of the Confederacy, Falconer returned to Mississippi and reentered the newspaper business, becoming editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Holly Springs Reporter</hi>. He began fostering an interest state politics and unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor as a Democrat under Benjamin G. Humphreys in 1868. In 1870, Falconer stepped away from editorial duties at the <hi rend='italic'>Reporter</hi> to practice law full time. He continued participating in Democratic politics and in 1877 was elected secretary of state. He entered that office in January 1878. However, only a few months later, a yellow fever epidemic struck parts of Mississippi. Falconer’s brother and father were stricken by the mosquito-borne disease. He went to Holly Springs to aid in their care, but both men died. Falconer himself then came down with the disease and died on September 23, 1878. He is buried in Hill Crest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD57096P0'>Historically free African Americans included people who were both African American and lived as and/or were legally free before the American Civil War. They may or may not have previously been enslaved. In recognition of African American military service during the Revolutionary War, a number of states moved to gradually abolish slavery leading to a growing body of free African Americans.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P1'>Freedom, however, did not mean citizenship, and despite efforts by free Black activists to settle this question and affirm their citizenship, it was largely left to state lawmakers who otherwise failed to settle the question. Consequently, during the Antebellum era, each southern state passed different laws governing the place and rights of free African Americans. Home to the nation's largest free African American community, for example, Baltimore, Maryland registered 25,000 free Black residents by 1850. (Martha S. Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</hi>, p. 13)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P2'>In another example, South Carolina's Act of 1820 distinguished between those freed before and after 1820, and classified free African Americans as "denizens," which limited citizenship rights by a series of Black Codes. In response to rebellions, numerous states passed legal restrictions that made manumission virtually impossible by the mid-nineteenth century. Loved ones who purchased family members were forced to legally hold them in bondage, leading to a body of people who "were free by practice, but not by law." (Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, <hi rend='italic'>Forging Freedom</hi>, 3–4, 207)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P3'>Unlike South Carolina, Mississippi's judiciary ruled that “free negroes . . . are to be regarded as alien enemies or strangers prohibited, and without the pale of comity, and incapable of acquiring or maintaining property in this State which will be recognized by our courts.” (<hi rend='italic'>Heirn v. Bridault</hi>, 37 Miss. 209, 224–25, 1859 in Jones, <hi rend='italic'>Birthright Citizens</hi>, p. 213) The state's strict provisions on manumission led to an extremely small population of free African Americans (773 people by 1860) during the antebellum era ("Free Blacks in Antebellum Mississippi," Mississippi Encyclopedia)
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD57096P4'>Newly freed African Americans includes people who were enslaved but became free by the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation and/or the Thirteenth Amendment. While neither was comprehensive, the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed the enslaved in territories under rebellion, and later the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 abolished slavery altogether, except when used as a punishment for those who committed a crime and did not apply to Native Nations who practices slavery. (American Battlefield Trust; Wikipedia) In the CWRGM collection, African Americans after December 6, 1865 are classified as historically free or newly freed.

              </note>
              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD63177P0'>The term "fugitive from justice" is defined broadly and covers a multiplicity of experiences under U.S. law, but refers most often to "a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals" (Wikipedia). Slightly different than the above definition, a fugitive from justice may also be defined as "a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control" of the party, be it local, national, or international, interested in their arrest (Wikipedia). In the nineteenth-century United States, fugitive status varied widely based on race. Many white people considered "fugitives from justice" were most often the latter definition, being those charged with or convicted of crimes who then fled across other state lines to try and evade punishment or trial. However, throughout American history up to Emancipation, fugitive status was given to escaped enslaved African Americans under the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and later 1850. These laws also required anyone in the nation to apprehend self-emancipated enslaved people and return them to their owners. The term "fugitives from justice" therefore became another legal mechanism by which enslavers sought to control the movements and freedoms of the enslaved, while contributing heavily to the increasing sectionalism that would lead to the American Civil War (Britannica). To learn more about enslaved people who emancipations themselves and were labeled fugitives, see the "Emancipation and self-emancipation" subject tag under Events.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD62968P0'>The Cambridge Dictionary classifies "a person who lives in the U.S. and is a member of a race of people with dark skin that originally came from Africa" as African American, but both the nineteenth-century and modern constructions are more complex (Cambridge Dictionary). Common nineteenth-century racial categories such as "mulatto" referred to persons with both white and black ancestry, and the experiences of mixed-race persons varied based on complexion, degree of African ancestry, and the region in which they lived. In antebellum cities with large populations of free Blacks, the degree of one's African ancestry could determine what rights one possessed or did not possess, and people with lighter skin tones were often considered to be white; this ended under "one drop rule" during the Jim Crow system.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P1'>Like skin tone, the ethnicity implied by the term "African American" is also problematically broad, as "naming people only by the continent of their origin and ignoring their ethnic identity is a consequence of time and space" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 5). The experience of slavery complicated the term by attempting to strip people of their original distinct African ethnic identities such as Ibo or Ndongan, classifying all persons of African descent together under one term, infusing that term with negative connotation, and disregarding the complex and rich linguistic, cultural, and ethnic histories of varied African people. However, many Black Americans have reclaimed the term "African American" and infused it with positive connotations. One scholar argues that "in using the term 'African Americans,' Black Americans accent the part of their heritage that is not American" (Painter, <hi rend='italic'>Creating Black Americans</hi>, 4).
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD62968P2'>CWRGM — acknowledging the multiplicity of the term's meanings and connotations — includes multiracial and multiethnic people of African descent under the "African Americans" social identifiers subject tag to reflect the diversity of the African American experience and to ensure that the experiences of African Americans of mixed races and ethnicities are discoverable as they are rarely distinguished further in the letters. In the absence of other references, CWRGM also tags racial slurs targeted at African Americans — which were common in nineteenth century documents with white authors — under the "African Americans" tag. CWRGM recognizes the historic and present harm caused by such language and does not condone its use but tags these terms only to ensure the rich history of African Americans are discoverable within the collection.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD69274P0'>Approximately 620,000 Americans died during the Civil War. For this reason, the war is often called America’s bloodiest conflict. However, two-thirds of Civil War deaths were caused by disease, not combat. The disparity is greater for non-fatal victims: 400,000 soldiers suffered wounds or injuries compared to 6,000,000 cases of illness. Since a combined 3,000,000 men fought in Union and Confederate armies, this means the average soldier fell ill to disease twice during his military service.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P1'>Numerous types of diseases afflicted soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Some were ubiquitous, like the common cold and diarrhea, which rarely garnered much attention unless the symptoms worsened into a more severe condition. Pneumonia, typhoid, and malaria were among the most serious diseases in the mid-nineteenth century. Epidemics of yellow fever and small pox also ravaged some civilian communities and military units. Perhaps the most deadly to Civil War soldiers, though, was dysentery, which was diarrhea with blood in the stool. Nearly 60,000 people died from dysentery during the war, and Union officials recorded 1.5 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P2'>All Americans, regardless of economic status or race, suffered pain and loss due to illness during the era. The President of the United States Abraham Lincoln and President of the Confederate States Jefferson Davis—the two most powerful individuals in North America, with access to the best resources—each lost a child to disease during the Civil War. The problem worsened with the sudden shifting of human populations during and after the war, as outbreaks of diseases spread rapidly. While many soldiers from highly populated areas had developed immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, mumps, measles citizen soldiers from rural areas proved more susceptible to severe reactions when exposed to those diseases. Physicians improved medical care during the Civil War, as many recognized the value of sunlight and fresh airflow. However, they could only provide soldiers such healthy conditions behind the lines, at hospitals or rest areas. In many camps, or in the field during campaigns, soldiers were exposed to poor weather, extreme temperatures, and unsanitary conditions. Those who suffered the worse were in prisoner of war camps, in both north and south, where thousands of soldiers died from dysentery or other diseases. Civil War doctors did not fully understand the spread of diseases, including contaminated water (in the case of typhoid and dysentery) or mosquitos (for malaria and yellow fever). As such, camps, forts, and prisons rarely were constructed with the soldiers’ health in mind, and Civil War medicine most often involved responding to disease rather than preventing it.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P3'>Another source of illness among soldiers, and civilians in war-torn areas, was dietary deficiencies. Despite efforts by subsistence and commissary personnel in Union and Confederate armies, feeding thousands of troops daily proved a monumental task. Food preservation techniques still relied heavily upon drying and salting, and fresh vegetables and fruits were limited and dependent upon seasons. As a result, most Civil War soldiers likely suffered from a Vitamin C deficiency, the most severe cases resulting in scurvy which caused the loss of teeth and bleeding. Heavy reliance upon corn-based foods, especially within southern military units or Union prisoners held in southern prisoner of war camps, led to high instances of pellagra, a condition caused by the lack of niacin (or vitamin B3). Present in most foods, but not corn, victims suffered from diarrhea, skin sores, and dementia.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P4'>Often ignored, Americans also suffered from sexually transmitted diseases during the Civil War and afterwards. Although rarely fatal, more than 100,000 soldiers were diagnosed with gonorrhea and nearly 80,000 became infected with syphilis. Unsurprisingly, most of these cases occurred when soldiers were near populated areas, especially during training or time in camp, where they had more opportunities to interact with women. Venereal disease rates were higher at the start and at the end of the Civil War. That trend may reflect the fact that rates went down for armies on campaign in the field. The overall rate of venereal disease in the Union Army fluctuated from about 82 to 87 cases for every 1,000 soldiers, Some Union military units reported extremely high rates of venereal disease, particularly in the west. For instance, military physicians in the Department of the Pacific recorded 461 cases out of 1,000 men in 1862.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P5'>The Civil War also led to disease outbreaks among civilians. Like country-born soldiers introduced to new diseases in military camps, fugitive or liberated slaves who congregated in refugee camps behind Union lines became exposed to new diseases. Cities besieged by armies, such as Vicksburg, Atlanta, and Richmond, faced problems with sanitation and food supplies, compromising the health and immune systems of local residents, leaving them more susceptible to illness.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD69274P6'>Finally, while most people survived bouts of illness during the Civil War, countless carried pathogens back to their home communities, or simply carried long-term effects from diseases within their bodies. Respiratory infections, blood borne diseases, and other afflictions obtained during the war decreased the quality of life of many Americans, or led to other health complications and early death.

Freemon, <hi rend='italic'>Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care during the American Civil War</hi>, 205–213; George Worthington Adams, <hi rend='italic'>Doctors in Blue</hi>, 3–5; Thomas P. Lowry, <hi rend='italic'>The Story the Soldiers Wouldn't Tell</hi>, 104–108)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD93397P0'>An epidemic is the increase in disease cases in a specific geographical area or population. Epidemics have affected communities throughout history and are caused by many different factors, such as contaminated water or food, mosquitos or other parasites, and interpersonal transmission. Epidemics frequently occur in highly populated areas, where diseases can spread rapidly before victims succumb to the illness or recover preventing further transmission.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P1'>Numerous epidemics occurred during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Most occurred within the large Union and Confederate armies, where thousands of soldiers lived in close proximity to each other, often in unsanitary conditions. The most common illnesses associated to epidemics were diarrhea, typhoid, malaria, yellow fever, measles, and smallpox.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P2'>Diarrhea (or dysentery, which was when blood was present in the stool) and typhoid spread through contaminated food or water. Since soldiers often shared sources of food and water, any bacteria or parasites present frequently afflicted many individuals around the same time.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P3'>Malaria and yellow fever were transmitted by mosquitos, who picked up the viruses from one person and infected another. This form of transmission often led to small epidemics within a group. Some nineteenth century construction projects, especially during the Civil War, exacerbated the problem by ignoring drainage measures and creating pools of stagnant water perfect for mosquito breeding. Ulysses S. Grant’s campaign in late 1862 and early 1863 to carve canals through the swamp west of Vicksburg, Mississippi, likely increased the mosquito population in that region. The large number of soldiers and laborers involved in the project further gave the parasites a steady food source and a substantial number of victims for the pathogen.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P4'>Measles and smallpox were highly contagious diseases that spread from person to person. Military activities during Civil War and social changes from the disruption and end of slavery caused various outbreaks of the diseases. The mobilization of thousands of soldiers brought together individuals previously isolated from certain disease, and therefore had no immunity. Similarly, as Union armies marched through the south, thousands of fugitive slaves and freed people left their small communities and sought safety or work in refugee camps or cities, unintentionally exposing themselves to new diseases.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P5'>Epidemics were most problematic when soldiers or civilians lived in austere conditions. Prisoners of war were among the most susceptible to disease outbreaks, since many prison camps were overcrowded, suffered from poor sanitation, and did not provide high enough quality or quantity of food for the prisoners to remain healthy. Dietary deficiencies, even in regular army camps, caused epidemics. Cases of scurvy, a severe lack of Vitamin C, increased to epidemic proportions when soldiers lacked fruits and vegetables for long periods of time.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P6'>Medical care improved some during the Civil War and Reconstruction era, as physicians began to see greater value in improving sanitation, sunlight, and airflow in hospitals. However, misinformation and misunderstanding of disease sources and transmission methods meant that medical personnel rarely managed to prevent epidemics. Most medical care during this era was responsive to outbreaks, rather than preventive measures.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD93397P7'>Most people survived the epidemics described above. Nevertheless, outbreaks reduced the number of healthy soldiers ready for campaign or combat, and many individual victims never fully recovered from diseases they acquired during epidemics.

              <term>Disease and Illness--Epidemic. Yellow Fever (1878)</term>

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32181152P0'>Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne disease that is caused by the arbovirus. Fever, muscle pain, headache, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting are common symptoms. In the worst cases, the virus’s attack on the liver and kidneys leads people to develop jaundice, causing the skin and eyes to develop a yellow hue. It is this tendency that gave the disease its name “yellow fever.” It has also been called “Yellow Jack,” “Black Vomit,” and “Bronze John.” The disease’s progression includes significant abdominal pain, dark, often bloody vomiting, bleeding from the nose, mouth, and eyes, and brain dysfunction, including delirium, seizures, and even coma. In the nineteenth century, there was no known cause and no known cure, making the disease terrifying to witness. Roughly half of patients who reached this latter stage died within seven to ten days. Today, yellow fever is preventable by vaccine, but historically the prolific nature of mosquitoes has ensured yellow fever was not just terrifying but also prone to reaching epidemic proportions.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32181152P1'>Between July and October 1878, yellow fever struck the Mississippi Valley, creating by far the worst epidemic in U.S. history up to that point. Although the disease likely affected and killed people sooner, the first official death was reported in New Orleans on July 10. By early August, the virus had made its way up the Mississippi River to Memphis, where another death was reported. Yellow fever struck the entire Mississippi River Valley from St. Louis, Missouri south. It quickly reached national headlines, with newspapers offering daily reports of deaths and of the disease’s spread. To combat the disease, tens of thousands fled the cities, including New Orleans, Vicksburg, and Memphis, ironically spreading the disease even further. The death tolls were staggering. Of an estimated 120,000 cases of reported yellow fever, at least 20,000 died, including entire families.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32181152P2'>The epidemic transformed sanitation, medical services, and the role of the federal government in public health. Historian Melanie Wiggins even goes so far as to call the result a “war” against yellow fever (“Combatting Yellow Fever in Galveston, 1839-1905"). Quarantines were implemented, incoming vessels were inspected, and travel along the Mississippi River stopped. Steamboats were tied up, and railroad lines were halted, bringing trade in the region to a standstill. New Orleans alone saw a loss of more than $15 million due to the disruptions in trade. The entire region estimated a loss of more than $30 million over the course of the epidemic, but this does not account for the high level of unemployment for those unable to work on the river or on the rail lines, for whom the loss of those wages was significant. Some local economies also never recovered. In Mississippi, for example, Beechland, near Vicksburg, became a ghost town.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32181152P3'>At the federal level, the government formed a National Relief Commission. It provided food, medicines, and other goods to the region. To do this, the steamer <hi rend='italic'>John M. Chambers</hi> traveled south from St. Louis carrying more than $20,000 worth of goods (worth more than $50 million today). In an effort to protect the crew, the boat was disinfected three times a day with chloride of lime and turpentine. Along the way, the crew encountered towns and cities that were abandoned or were quarantined so completely as to have armed guards stationed to prevent anyone from landing. But the steamer was able to make over thirty stops, including a final stop at Vicksburg in October. By the end of the month, the <hi rend='italic'>Chambers</hi> completed its trip by returning to St. Louis. Less than three quarters of the original crew remained. Nevertheless, the federal government deemed the mission a success, and in March 1879, it established the National Board of Health, forever transforming the role of government in national health.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32181152P4'>In the end, yellow fever was defeated by the cold, fizzling out in November 1878. It would take until the turn of the century before the virus’s cause would be determined and a vaccine developed, but the epidemic of 1878 left an irrevocable mark on the Mississippi Valley and U.S. public health more broadly.

If I have erred in ad-dressing Your Excellency, please inform me what course to persue as I am placed in such an attitude that I know not the proper course during the Sheriff absence &amp; the scarity of white men here.
